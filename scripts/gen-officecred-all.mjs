The real distinction that matters for an office is function, not the name: whether the piece is built for file storage, general storage, or as a working surface, not which of the three words appears in the listing title." },
  { key: "locking-office-storage-security", q: "Is a locking office credenza actually secure, or just private?", a: "Most locks on office credenzas are privacy and access-control features, not burglary-rated security. They keep casual access out and satisfy basic confidentiality needs, but they should not be relied on the same way as a rated safe if the contents are genuinely high-value or sensitive." },
  { key: "credenza-weight-capacity-printer", q: "How do I know if a credenza top can actually hold a printer?", a: "Check for a documented load rating in the product specs rather than assuming any flat surface can support office equipment indefinitely. A multifunction printer with paper loaded can weigh well over 20 lbs, and repeated vibration from printing can stress an unrated surface over time even if it doesn't fail immediately." },
  { key: "credenza-assembly-time", q: "How long does assembling an office credenza usually take?", a: "Most flat-pack office credenzas in this category take 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on drawer count and size, and manufacturers commonly recommend two people for anything over about 60 inches wide or 150 lbs, both for handling the panels safely and for aligning larger cabinets correctly." },
  { key: "credenza-file-drawer-sizes", q: "Do all office credenza file drawers fit both letter and legal size folders?", a: "No, this varies by model. Some use adjustable hanging rails that reconfigure between letter, A4, and legal, while others are built for only one size. Always check the specific drawer's documented file compatibility rather than assuming 'file drawer' means universal size support." },
  { key: "credenza-solid-wood-vs-veneer", q: "How can I tell if a credenza is genuinely solid wood versus veneer or laminate?", a: "A finish name like walnut, oak, or mahogany often describes the color or stain rather than the underlying material, since engineered wood and MDF are frequently finished to resemble a specific species. Check the product's stated construction material directly, and inspect edges and corners in photos where the substrate is more likely to show through." },

    case "filedrawers":
      return [
        { q: `Do the file drawers in ${K} fit both letter and legal size folders?`, a: "This varies by model. Some use adjustable hanging rails that reconfigure between letter, A4, and legal, while others are built for one size only. Always check the specific product's documented file compatibility rather than assuming all 'file drawer' credenzas support every size." },
        { q: "Why do some file drawers lock and others in the same credenza don't?", a: "Manufacturers commonly lock only the drawer intended for confidential documents, leaving supply or general-purpose drawers unlocked for quick daily access. Check the specific drawer-by-drawer lock coverage before assuming the whole unit secures uniformly." },
      ];
    case "hutch":
      return [
        { q: `Can any hutch be added to ${K} later, or does it need to match exactly?`, a: "Hutches are typically designed for a specific base model's exact width and mounting points, so a hutch from a different product line usually will not fasten correctly even if it looks similar. Check official compatibility before buying a hutch separately." },
        { q: "Does adding a hutch make the credenza less stable?", a: "A hutch raises the total height and shifts weight upward, which is why most hutch-equipped credenzas require wall anchoring or anti-tip hardware that a hutch-free credenza does not need. Confirm the specific anchoring requirement before installation." },
      ];
    case "storage":
      return [
        { q: `Does more doors on ${K} always mean more usable storage?`, a: "Not necessarily. Interior partitions and hardware can make a 4-door design's individual bays smaller than a 2-door design with a more open interior layout. Compare actual interior dimensions per compartment, not door count." },
        { q: "Can office storage credenzas hold a printer safely?", a: "Only if the top surface has a documented load rating that covers your specific printer's weight, especially with paper loaded. Don't assume any flat top surface is rated for sustained equipment weight without checking." },
      ];
    case "color":
      return [
        { q: `Will the color on ${K} look consistent across the top, drawers, and doors?`, a: "Not always. Add-on components like hutches and separately manufactured drawer fronts don't always match perfectly across production batches, so check reviews or product photos for component color consistency before ordering." },
        { q: "Do darker or lighter finishes show scratches more?", a: "This depends more on gloss level and whether the substrate underneath contrasts with the surface color than on the color itself. A glossy dark finish over a light substrate can show scratches more dramatically than a matte finish in either color." },
      ];
    case "deskset":
      return [
        { q: `Can the desk and credenza in ${K} be purchased or used separately?`, a: "This varies by set. Some are designed as genuinely separable pieces that work independently, while others are meant to function only as a matched pair. Check the specific listing before assuming either way." },
        { q: "How much total floor space does a desk-and-credenza set actually need?", a: "Plan for both pieces' footprints plus a working aisle between them, not just the desk's footprint alone. A two-piece set generally needs more total room than a single all-in-one credenza desk." },
      ];
    case "small":
      return [
        { q: `How compact does ${K} actually need to be to fit a small office?`, a: "Set explicit width and depth thresholds based on your specific room measurements rather than trusting a 'small' or 'narrow' label alone, since these terms are used inconsistently across listings." },
        { q: "Do compact credenzas sacrifice real storage capacity?", a: "Often somewhat, yes, since less exterior volume generally means less interior volume too. Compare storage-per-inch efficiency rather than assuming a compact model matches a full-size credenza's capacity." },
      ];
    case "wood-species":
      return [
        { q: `Is ${K} genuinely solid wood, or is that just the finish name?`, a: "Check the product's stated construction material directly. Species names are frequently used as finish or stain descriptions on engineered wood or MDF rather than proof of solid material throughout." },
        { q: "Does a wood species name affect the price meaningfully?", a: "Genuine solid wood in that species typically costs more than an engineered-wood equivalent finished to resemble it, so a suspiciously low price paired with a premium species name is worth double-checking against the actual construction details." },
      ];
    case "solid-wood":
      return [
        { q: `How much heavier is a genuinely solid-wood credenza like ${K} compared to engineered wood?`, a: "Meaningfully heavier, often by 30 to 50 percent or more at a similar size, which affects both delivery logistics and how easily it can be moved again later. Check the documented assembled weight before ordering." },
        { q: "Will a solid-wood credenza need special care compared to engineered wood?", a: "Generally yes to some degree. Solid wood responds to humidity changes with minor expansion and contraction, and benefits from periodic conditioning or polish, while engineered wood and laminate are more dimensionally stable but harder to refinish if damaged." },
      ];
    case "style":
      return [
        { q: `Is a ${K} genuinely more durable than a plain laminate credenza, or just styled differently?`, a: "Style and durability are separate questions. Many style-forward credenzas use similar engineered substrates to plain designs, just with different door, leg, or trim details, so check construction specifics rather than assuming style implies better or worse durability." },
        { q: "Do decorative legs or open frames affect stability?", a: "They can. Open-leg and slatted-front designs sometimes flex more under load than a solid-sided cabinet, so check stability specifically if the credenza will carry loaded drawers plus equipment on top." },
      ];
    case "executive":
      return [
        { q: `What makes ${K} suitable for an executive office versus a standard credenza?`, a: "Typically a combination of premium finish durability, secure file storage, and coordinated styling with a matching desk, rather than one single feature. Check each of these individually rather than assuming 'executive' branding covers all three." },
        { q: "Do executive credenzas typically include better warranties?", a: "Not automatically, though commercial-grade brands often do offer longer warranty terms than residential RTA furniture. Check the specific warranty length rather than assuming executive styling implies better coverage." },
      ];
    case "shelves":
      return [
        { q: `Are the shelves in ${K} strong enough for a full row of hardcover books?`, a: "Only if there's a documented per-shelf weight rating that covers it. A full shelf of hardcover books can weigh 30 to 40 lbs or more, so check for a specific rating rather than assuming any shelf can handle it." },
        { q: "Do open shelves need anti-tip hardware?", a: "Yes, especially on taller pieces, since open shelving concentrates weight higher up than a low, drawer-only cabinet. Confirm anti-tip wall-anchor hardware is included standard." },
      ];
    case "drawers":
      return [
        { q: `Are all the drawers on ${K} the same type, or a mix?`, a: "Check individually. Many credenzas mix supply drawers, box drawers, and file drawers in the same unit, and each type has a different interior layout suited to different contents." },
        { q: "Can heavy drawers cause the credenza to tip if several are opened at once?", a: "It's possible on some designs without an interlock or anti-tip mechanism, particularly if the drawers are loaded and extended fully at the same time. Check for documented interlock behavior if this is a household with kids or a shared office." },
      ];
    case "cabinets":
    case "filecabinets":
      return [
        { q: `What's actually stored behind the cabinet doors on ${K}?`, a: "This varies significantly, from open adjustable shelving to hidden file drawers to a mix of both. Check the interior layout description rather than assuming a cabinet door automatically means file storage." },
        { q: "Are cabinet-style file credenzas as functional as dedicated file drawers?", a: "They can be, but documentation is often less consistent. If letter/legal compatibility and hanging-rail presence matter to you, verify these details directly rather than assuming a cabinet door hides the same file-ready interior as a labeled file drawer." },
      ];
    case "locking":
      return [
        { q: `Does the lock on ${K} cover the whole credenza or just one drawer?`, a: "Check the specific product documentation, since it's common for a single lock to secure only one drawer or pedestal while the rest of the credenza remains open. Don't assume whole-unit security from a general 'locking' label." },
        { q: "Is an office credenza lock rated against forced entry?", a: "Generally no. Most office storage locks are privacy and access-control features, not independently tested burglary security, so treat them accordingly if the contents are genuinely high-value." },
      ];
    case "metal":
      return [
        { q: `Is ${K} a full steel case, or just metal accents on a wood body?`, a: "This varies significantly by listing. Some 'metal' credenzas are structurally steel throughout, while others use metal only for the frame, legs, or decorative trim over an engineered-wood case. Check the construction description directly." },
        { q: "Are metal file credenzas noisier than wood ones?", a: "They can be, particularly with drawer suspension and rattle under load, since metal doesn't dampen vibration the way wood or laminate-over-particleboard does. This varies by specific hardware quality." },
      ];
    case "doors":
      return [
        { q: `Does a 4-door design on ${K} give more storage than a 2-door credenza of the same width?`, a: "Not automatically. More doors can mean smaller individual compartments due to added partitions and hinge hardware, so compare total interior volume and per-bay dimensions rather than assuming door count scales directly with capacity." },
        { q: "Is it harder to open multiple doors in a tight office layout?", a: "Yes, if several doors need to open simultaneously for full access. Measure the combined swing clearance needed in your specific layout rather than assuming a single-door clearance measurement applies." },
      ];
    case "width":
      return [
        { q: `Does the nominal width on ${K} match its true assembled footprint?`, a: "Usually close, but check for any top or trim overhang that extends slightly beyond the case width, since this can matter in a tight wall run where every half inch counts." },
        { q: "Should I measure my wall space before or after accounting for baseboards?", a: "After. Baseboard depth can reduce how far back against the wall a credenza actually sits, effectively adding to its footprint in the room even though it doesn't change the product's stated dimensions." },
      ];
    case "printers":
      return [
        { q: `Can ${K} support a heavy multifunction printer safely?`, a: "Only if there's a documented top load rating that covers your printer's weight with paper loaded, which can exceed 20 to 30 lbs for a larger multifunction unit. Check for a specific rating rather than assuming any flat surface qualifies." },
        { q: "Does a printer on top of a credenza need special ventilation clearance?", a: "Most multifunction printers need some rear and side clearance for heat dissipation and paper-jam access, so leave a few inches of clearance around the unit rather than pushing it flush against a wall or hutch backboard." },
      ];
    case "homeoffice":
      return [
        { q: `How much wall space does ${K} actually need including doors and drawers open?`, a: "Measure the footprint with everything fully open, not just the closed exterior dimensions, and add baseboard depth, since residential rooms often have less margin than a commercial office layout accounts for." },
        { q: "Is a home-office credenza assembly harder than office furniture?", a: "It varies by model rather than by the home-versus-office distinction itself, though many home-office credenzas use RTA flat-pack construction that trades easier shipping for a longer assembly process compared to pre-assembled commercial furniture." },
      ];
    case "budget":
      return [
        { q: `Are budget office credenzas like ${K} actually lower quality, or just less styled?`, a: "It varies. Some budget options use thinner substrate or simpler hardware to hit a lower price point, while others simply skip decorative styling while keeping comparable construction. Compare documented panel thickness and hardware specifics rather than assuming price alone indicates quality." },
        { q: "What should I check before buying the cheapest option available?", a: "Verify what storage is actually included (drawers, file rails, shelves), the panel thickness where documented, and the warranty and replacement-part support, since these details are often what separates genuinely comparable budget options from ones that cut real corners." },
      ];
    default:
      return [
        { q: `What's the biggest mistake buyers make when shopping for ${K}?`, a: "Judging capacity by exterior width or door count alone. Interior partitions, hardware, and shelf placement can make two similarly sized credenzas hold meaningfully different amounts, so always check interior dimensions specifically." },
        { q: `Should I prioritize style or function when choosing ${K}?`, a: "Function first, since a credenza that doesn't fit your actual file sizes, equipment, or storage needs won't become more useful because it looks good. Narrow the field by function, then choose among the finalists by style." },
