Check for real benchmark comparisons on your specific host and GPU pairing rather than assuming a fixed percentage." },
  { key: "egpu-macbook-compatibility", q: "Do all Thunderbolt-equipped Macs support eGPUs?", a: "No. Apple's official eGPU support is specific to Intel-based Thunderbolt 3 Macs; Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and later) do not officially support external GPUs for graphics acceleration, regardless of port type. Check Apple's current documentation for your specific Mac before assuming compatibility." },
  { key: "egpu-vs-oculink-tradeoff", q: "Should I choose a Thunderbolt/USB4 enclosure or an OCuLink one?", a: "Thunderbolt and USB4 tunnel PCIe over a general-purpose port shared with other data, while OCuLink provides a more direct PCIe connection with typically lower overhead, but neither hot-plugs as easily and OCuLink support is far less common on laptops. Match the choice to what your specific host actually exposes." },
  { key: "egpu-power-supply-sizing", q: "How do I know what wattage power supply my eGPU setup needs?", a: "Size the PSU to your specific GPU's rated power draw plus reasonable headroom, not the enclosure's maximum rated capacity, since an oversized PSU wastes money while an undersized one causes instability under load. Check your GPU manufacturer's recommended PSU wattage directly." },
  { key: "egpu-hot-plug-safety", q: "Is it safe to plug or unplug an eGPU while the computer is running?", a: "This depends entirely on the connection type: most Thunderbolt and USB4 enclosures support hot-plugging safely, while OCuLink connections generally do not and require a full shutdown first. Always check your specific enclosure's documentation rather than assuming hot-plug support." },
  { key: "egpu-laptop-charging-tradeoff", q: "Can an eGPU enclosure charge my laptop while running the external GPU?", a: "Many Thunderbolt/USB4 enclosures include Power Delivery charging through the same cable, but the wattage varies significantly by model (commonly 15W to 140W), and it's a separate specification from the GPU's own power supply, so check both figures independently before assuming your laptop charges at full speed." },

        { q: "Can I upgrade an enclosure's power supply for a more powerful GPU later?", a: "On enclosures with a replaceable PSU format (typically ATX or SFX), yes, but confirm the enclosure's power supply bay accepts a higher-wattage unit before assuming an easy upgrade." },

        { q: "Do higher-end RTX cards need a different eGPU enclosure than mid-range cards?", a: "Often yes, since higher-power cards need a larger PSU, wider slot clearance, and sometimes triple-slot width support that budget or compact enclosures don't provide." },
