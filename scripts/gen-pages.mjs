For shorter users whose feet do not comfortably reach the floor from a standard chair, the footrest height requirement is greater than for average-height users.

For users who adjust their desk height throughout the day, share a desk with another person, or switch between a standard office chair and a drafting stool, a fixed footrest creates a different ergonomic problem every time the setup changes.", intro2: "This guide covers eight adjustable under-desk footrests ranked by Amazon buyer rating and verified review count, focusing on models with meaningful height or angle adjustment rather than fixed single-position designs.", intro3: "For the full footrest category including fixed-height options, see our <Link href='/guide/best-under-desk-footrests' className='text-brand hover:underline'>best under-desk footrests</Link> guide." },

The material does not compress over time, provides a firmer rocking surface, and matches the aesthetic of wood desks and natural material desk setups. The trade-off is that wood is harder underfoot, louder when rocking, and not suited for bare-foot use.", intro2: "This guide covers eight wooden footrests ranked by Amazon buyer rating and verified review count, including cherry wood rockers, lauan hardwood adjustable platforms, bamboo options, and a premium steel-roller wood rocker.", intro3: "For the full footrest category including foam and adjustable models, see our <Link href='/guide/best-under-desk-footrests' className='text-brand hover:underline'>best under-desk footrests</Link> guide." },
