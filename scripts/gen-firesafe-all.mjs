  { key: "fireproof-vs-fire-resistant", q: "What's the real difference between 'fireproof' and 'fire-resistant' safes?", a: "No consumer safe is truly fireproof in the sense of being immune to fire; every model is rated for a specific duration and temperature after which its contents are no longer guaranteed protected. 'Fire-resistant' is the more accurate term, and the specific UL or ETL classification (time and temperature) tells you more than either marketing word alone." },
  { key: "ul-classification-mean", q: "What does a UL fire classification actually certify?", a: "A UL Classified rating means an independent lab tested that specific model to a defined time-and-temperature standard (commonly 1/2 hour at 1550°F, 1 hour at 1700°F, or 2 hours at 1850°F) and confirmed the interior stayed below a safe threshold for paper documents. It's a model-specific certification, not a general brand claim." },
  { key: "fireproof-vs-waterproof-safe", q: "Does a fireproof safe also protect against water damage?", a: "Not automatically. Fire and water resistance are tested and certified separately, even on the same product, so check both ratings independently rather than assuming a fireproof safe is also waterproof, or vice versa. Many current SentrySafe and Master Lock models document both, but budget safes may only address one." },
  { key: "nominal-vs-usable-capacity", q: "Does the cubic-foot rating on a safe match its real usable storage space?", a: "Not exactly. Fire insulation, shelving, and door hardware all take up interior volume, so the nominal cubic-foot figure is always somewhat larger than what you can actually pack inside. Check interior dimensions and shelf layout, not just the headline capacity number." },
  { key: "anchoring-safe-floor-wall", q: "Should a fireproof safe be bolted to the floor or wall?", a: "For anything beyond a small portable chest, yes, if theft deterrence matters to you: an unanchored safe, however heavy, can still be carried off by a determined thief with the right tools and enough time. Most safes over about 1 cubic foot include pre-drilled mounting holes and hardware for this reason." },
  { key: "warranty-fire-damage-replacement", q: "What happens if a safe is actually damaged in a real fire?", a: "Policies vary by brand. Some manufacturers, including SentrySafe and TIGERKING, offer a fire-damage replacement program that replaces the safe (not necessarily its contents) if it's damaged protecting your belongings in an actual fire; check the specific model's warranty terms rather than assuming this is universal." },
  { key: "moisture-safe-humidity", q: "Do I need to worry about humidity inside a closed fireproof safe?", a: "Yes, especially in humid climates or basements. First Alert and other manufacturers recommend periodically airing out the safe and using a silica gel packet inside molded fire-resistant safes, since the same seal that keeps fire and water out during an emergency can also trap ambient moisture during normal storage." },

      return [
        { q: `How big of a ${K} do I actually need?`, a: "Start with an inventory of what you'd actually store: passports, deeds, a few external drives, maybe some jewelry, then check interior dimensions against that list rather than picking a size based on price alone." },
        { q: "Is a fireproof safe for home worth it if I already back up digital copies?", a: "Yes for physical originals like passports, deeds, and birth certificates that can't simply be re-printed from a backup; digital backups protect information, a physical safe protects the irreplaceable original document itself." },
      ];
    case "documents":
      return [
        { q: `Do I need to fold documents to fit in a ${K}?`, a: "It depends on interior depth; some document safes lay letter-size paper flat while more compact chests require folding. Check the stated interior dimensions against your actual folder sizes before assuming either way." },
        { q: "Are digital media (USB drives, CDs) protected the same way as paper documents?", a: "Not automatically. Digital media has a lower heat tolerance than paper, so many safes carry a separate, often shorter-duration ETL verification specifically for digital media alongside the main paper-document fire rating." },
      ];
    case "box":
      return [
        { q: `Is a ${K} as secure as a full-size safe?`, a: "Generally no. A chest-style box typically uses a simpler key or latch lock and lighter construction than a bolted-down safe, trading some security for portability and lower cost." },
        { q: "Can a fireproof box be anchored to prevent theft?", a: "Some models include bolt-down hardware, but many chest-style boxes are designed purely for portability and don't include anchoring points; check the specific listing if theft deterrence matters to you." },
      ];
    case "hour":
      return [
        { q: `Is a longer duration always better for a ${K}?`, a: "Generally yes for protection, but longer ratings also mean thicker insulation, more weight, and less usable interior space per exterior cubic foot, so match the duration to your genuine risk rather than always buying the maximum." },
        { q: "How is a fire-duration rating actually tested?", a: "Independent labs place a loaded safe in a furnace at a specified temperature for the stated duration, then check that the interior stayed below the threshold that would damage paper (typically well under 350°F even when the exterior sees 1550-1850°F)." },
      ];
    case "small":
      return [
        { q: `What actually fits inside a ${K}?`, a: "Small fireproof safes typically fit folded or letter-size documents, passports, some cash, and small jewelry; check interior dimensions specifically if you plan to store anything bulkier like binders or a laptop." },
        { q: "Is a small fireproof safe easy to steal since it's portable?", a: "Yes, that's the real tradeoff of small, portable safes: the same size that makes them convenient to hide or carry also makes them easy for a thief to simply take the whole unit. Anchor it or store it somewhere genuinely concealed if that's a concern." },
      ];
    case "large":
      return [
        { q: `How much does a ${K} typically weigh?`, a: "Large fireproof safes commonly weigh anywhere from 100 to over 300 lbs depending on capacity and fire-duration rating; always check the specific model's weight against your floor and delivery access before ordering." },
        { q: "Do large fireproof safes require professional installation?", a: "Not always required, but professional delivery and placement is strongly recommended for anything over roughly 150 lbs, both for safety and to avoid floor or stairwell damage during the move." },
      ];
    case "cash":
      return [
        { q: `Is a ${K} rated for burglary protection or just fire?`, a: "Check independently. Many fireproof safes marketed for cash storage have real physical security features like solid bolts and steel construction, but formal burglary-rated (UL RSC or higher) testing is a separate, less common certification." },
        { q: "Should a cash safe be anchored even if it's not very heavy?", a: "Yes, especially for cash. A lighter safe that isn't bolted down can simply be carried away by a thief regardless of its lock quality, so anchoring hardware matters more for cash storage than for document-only safes." },
      ];
    case "combination":
      return [
        { q: `What happens if I forget the combination on a ${K}?`, a: "Most combination safes include an emergency override key for exactly this situation; if that key is also lost, you'll likely need a professional locksmith, since mechanical combination locks generally can't be reset without one." },
        { q: "Are combination locks more reliable than digital keypads long-term?", a: "Mechanical combination locks have no battery to fail, which is a real long-term reliability advantage, though they're typically slower to operate day-to-day than a digital keypad." },
      ];
    case "waterproof":
      return [
        { q: `How deep of water can a ${K} actually handle?`, a: "This varies significantly by model, from a few inches for a limited period up to full submersion for 24 to 72 hours on premium models; check the specific depth and duration figures rather than trusting the word 'waterproof' alone." },
        { q: "Can I open a waterproof safe immediately after flood exposure?", a: "It's generally safer to let the safe sit and drain before opening if it's been submerged, and to dry contents carefully afterward; check the manufacturer's specific post-flood handling guidance if available." },
      ];
    case "digital":
      return [
        { q: `What batteries does a ${K} typically need?`, a: "Most digital fireproof safes use standard AA batteries, commonly 4 of them, and many include a low-battery warning light or sound before they fully die; check whether batteries are included or need to be purchased separately." },
        { q: "What happens if the batteries die and I don't have a spare key?", a: "Most digital safes with this risk include an external battery port or connector that lets you power the keypad temporarily from an outside battery pack to unlock and replace the internal batteries." },
      ];
    case "jewelry":
      return [
        { q: `Will storing jewelry in a ${K} cause tarnishing?`, a: "Sealed environments can trap humidity that accelerates tarnish on silver and some metals; airing the safe out periodically or adding a silica gel or anti-tarnish packet helps mitigate this for long-term storage." },
        { q: "Do fireproof safes include dedicated jewelry trays?", a: "Some do, particularly models marketed toward valuables, while many general-purpose fireproof safes just include a flat shelf; check the specific listing if a soft-lined jewelry tray matters to you." },
      ];
    case "brand":
      return [
        { q: `Are all ${K} products fire-rated, or just some?`, a: "Check each specific model individually. Established brands in this category typically sell both fire-resistant safes and purely security-focused (non-fire-rated) products side by side under the same name." },
        { q: "Does buying a well-known brand guarantee better fire protection than a generic safe?", a: "Not automatically, though established brands more often publish independent UL or ETL evidence for their fire-rated models. Always check the specific classification rather than relying on brand name alone." },
      ];
    case "budget":
      return [
        { q: `Are budget fireproof safes genuinely fire-tested, or just marketed that way?`, a: "It varies significantly. Some budget models carry genuine UL or ETL classifications at a lower price point, while others use 'fireproof' or 'fire-resistant' language without independent backing; check for a specific documented rating before trusting the claim." },
        { q: "What am I giving up by buying the cheapest fireproof safe available?", a: "Typically usable interior space, bolt count and steel thickness, warranty length, and sometimes independent fire-test documentation; compare these specifics rather than price alone." },
      ];
    case "key":
      return [
        { q: `How many keys come with a ${K}?`, a: "Most key-lock fireproof safes include 2 keys as standard, one for daily use and one spare; check the specific listing since this can vary by model." },
        { q: "What if I lose both keys to my fireproof safe?", a: "Options depend on the model: some manufacturers offer replacement keys by serial or lock-cylinder number, while others may require drilling the lock or professional locksmith service. Check the manufacturer's stated replacement-key policy before you need it." },
      ];
    case "drawer":
      return [
        { q: `Can a ${K} hold both letter and legal-size files?`, a: "Check the specific listing, since drawer-style fireproof storage varies in filing orientation and dimension; some support both sizes while others are sized for one or the other specifically." },
        { q: "Do fireproof file drawers need an anti-tip feature?", a: "Yes, if the unit is tall or top-heavy; a loaded top drawer opened without anti-tip protection can cause the whole unit to tip forward, so check for this feature on any multi-drawer fireproof storage." },
      ];
    case "portable":
      return [
        { q: `How heavy does a ${K} get once it's actually loaded?`, a: "This depends heavily on what you store, but even a modest stack of documents plus a laptop or hard drives can add meaningful weight to a safe that felt light empty; check the safe's own weight and add a realistic estimate of your contents." },
        { q: "Is a portable fireproof safe as secure as a stationary one?", a: "Generally no. The same portability that makes it easy to grab during an evacuation also makes it easier for a thief to carry off; portable safes trade some security for mobility, which is a reasonable tradeoff for some use cases but not others." },
      ];
    case "heavyduty":
      return [
        { q: `Does "heavy duty" mean a ${K} is burglary-rated?`, a: "Not automatically. Heavy-duty construction (thick steel, multiple bolts) improves real-world forced-entry resistance, but a formal independent burglary rating (like UL RSC) is a separate, specific certification that not all heavy-duty safes carry." },
        { q: "Is a heavier fireproof safe always better protection?", a: "Weight helps deter casual theft and can indicate thicker steel, but it doesn't by itself establish a fire rating or verified burglary resistance; check both of those specifically rather than judging by weight alone." },
      ];
    case "office":
      return [
        { q: `Should an office ${K} use a shared code or individual employee codes?`, a: "It depends on your access-control needs; a single shared code is simpler but harder to audit, while individual codes (on models that support multiple users) let you track and revoke access per employee." },
        { q: "Do office fireproof safes need to be bolted down?", a: "Strongly recommended for anything storing cash, checks, or sensitive records, since an unanchored safe in a semi-public office space is more vulnerable to being carried out than one in a private home." },
      ];
    case "ul":
      return [
        { q: `Is a ${K} rating the same as a general fireproof claim?`, a: "No, a specific UL classification is a documented, independently tested standard tied to an exact model, time, and temperature, meaningfully stronger evidence than a general 'fireproof' or 'fire-resistant' marketing claim." },
        { q: "Where can I verify a safe's UL classification independently?", a: "Check UL's own online certification directory using the model number where possible, or request documentation directly from the manufacturer, rather than relying solely on the product listing's stated claim." },
      ];
    case "capacity":
      return [
        { q: `Does the cubic-foot number on a ${K} include the door and shelving space?`, a: "Nominal cubic-foot figures are typically based on the full interior cavity before subtracting shelving or door-hardware intrusion, so real usable space is somewhat less than the advertised number." },
        { q: "How much does fire insulation reduce usable interior space?", a: "It varies by model and fire-duration rating, but insulation commonly accounts for a meaningful share of the difference between a safe's exterior footprint and its interior capacity, more so on longer-duration (1-2 hour) models than on lighter 30-minute chests." },
      ];
    default:
      return [
        { q: `Is a ${K} genuinely fireproof, or just fire-resistant?`, a: "No consumer safe is immune to fire indefinitely; every rated model protects for a specific duration and temperature, after which contents are no longer guaranteed safe. 'Fire-resistant' with a documented rating is the more accurate framing than 'fireproof.'" },
        { q: `What should I check before buying a ${K}?`, a: "Verify the independent fire classification (time and temperature), check usable interior dimensions rather than nominal capacity, and confirm water resistance and physical security as separate facts rather than assuming any one claim covers the others." },
