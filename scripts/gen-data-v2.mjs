The non-slip silicone pads protect the laptop finish at the contact points without leaving marks.\n\nAt $21.84 it is a competitive aluminum stand backed by OMOTON's lifetime warranty.

  description: "The OMOTON dual vertical stand provides two independently adjustable aluminum slots in a footprint smaller than two separate single stands. Each slot adjusts from 0.55 to 1.65 inches and locks independently, so a thin MacBook Air and a thicker Windows laptop can share the same stand without compromise.\n\nAt $27.99 it is the most affordable dual-slot aluminum stand with independent per-slot adjustment and a lifetime warranty. Users managing two devices benefit from the consolidated footprint and the aluminum construction that holds its adjustment position over daily use.",

Each slot adjusts independently from 0.55 to 1.65 inches.\n\nAt $29.99 it is $2 more than the silver model.

A captive screw locks the rotation once set. The dual slots adjust to fit two laptops of different thicknesses simultaneously.\n\nAt $21.99 it is the rotating dual stand option at a price below most single-slot premium stands. Users who share a desk and rotate the stand for different users, or who need to access the stand from different directions depending on the task, get practical value from the rotation that fixed-base stands cannot provide.",

  description: "The UGREEN single vertical stand features a cable cutout channel at the base that routes charging and peripheral cables through the stand cleanly rather than letting them drag over the desk surface. The aluminum body adjusts from 0.47 to 1 inch via a knurled knob.\n\nAt $19.99 it occupies the same price point as the OMOTON single but adds cable routing at the cost of a narrower adjustment range.

The adjustable slot width handles most consumer laptops without tools.\n\nAt $22.79 it is the mid-range aluminum stand with the cable management advantage. Users who have a dedicated desk setup where cable routing visibility matters find the cutout channel worth the small premium over stands without it.",

The dedicated inserts grip the MacBook at precise contact points without applying pressure to the hinge area.\n\nAt $39.99 it is the MacBook-first option in this roundup. The lifetime warranty and precision fit make it the correct stand for users who want the most intentional, scratch-free vertical MacBook storage available rather than a universal stand that happens to hold a MacBook.",

  description: "The Twelve South BookArc is a minimal single-piece aluminum arc that supports the MacBook at the base with three interchangeable silicone inserts sized for specific MacBook models. The arc design makes the stand visually recede when the MacBook is docked, showing only the laptop rather than a prominent stand mechanism.\n\nAt $16.99 it delivers the cleanest MacBook desk aesthetic at a price lower than most universal aluminum stands. Users who want the stand to disappear visually find no better option in this roundup at any price.",

  description: "The UPERGO walnut stand combines solid black walnut wood with aluminum cradle arms, creating a dual-material stand that is visually distinct from every aluminum-only competitor in this roundup. The handcrafted walnut base provides natural texture and warm color that metal stands cannot replicate.\n\nAt $39.99 it is the premium aesthetic option for desk setups where natural materials complement wood desk surfaces or warm-toned interiors. The adjustable aluminum cradle fits laptops from 0.47 to 1.1 inches thick without sacrificing the walnut aesthetic, and the dual-slot format stores two devices.",

The ABS construction keeps price at $11.96 while the adjustable laptop slots accommodate devices of different widths.\n\nAt $11.96 it is the lowest-priced multi-device organizer in this roundup by a significant margin. Users who need to corral four devices in one organized spot and want to minimize cost find no comparable option.",

  cons: ["Fewer buyer ratings than established brands", "Mechanism requires specific laptop weight range"],
  description: "The SODI stand uses a gravity auto-lock mechanism that grips the device automatically when placed in and releases when lifted out, eliminating the screw adjustment step that other stands require. The 3-in-1 format stores a laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously in separate slots.\n\nAt $21.99 the auto-lock mechanism is the practical differentiator. Users who insert and remove their laptop multiple times throughout the day appreciate not having to adjust a screw each time, which is the main friction point with manual-adjust alternatives.",

The memory foam top layer provides cushioning underfoot while the non-slip bottom keeps it in place on hard floors.\n\nAt $22.79 it is the most affordable pick in this roundup and the one with the largest buyer feedback base confirming consistent performance.

The wrist rest along the front edge raises the hands to a more neutral typing angle during extended typing sessions.\n\nAt $34.95 it is the dedicated memory foam choice for users who want maximum cushion softness and a wider-than-standard surface.

The adjustable bolster cushion allows positioning adjustment for different sitting angles and the peripheral slots along the edges store phone, pen, and tablet without increasing the main surface footprint.\n\nAt $62.99 it is the premium oversized option for users who need the maximum surface area from a lap desk.

The anti-slip strip along the bottom edge prevents movement on smooth surfaces.\n\nAs the largest foldable option in this roundup, the PHANCIR is the correct choice for users who need a wide workspace in bed but have limited storage space for a fixed frame. The foldable legs reduce storage volume significantly compared to non-folding wide-surface alternatives.",

// ── buying criteria ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const BC_VERTICAL_STANDS = [
  { criterion: "Aluminum vs ABS plastic", explanation: "Aluminum stands hold their adjustment position longer, resist scratching, and match premium laptop aesthetics. ABS plastic costs less but slots loosen faster with daily use. For clamshell mode at a permanent desk, aluminum is worth the small premium." },
  { criterion: "Adjustment range", explanation: "Most consumer laptops are 0.5 to 0.85 inches thick. A range of 0.47 to 1.65 inches covers this and adds room for laptops with cases. For households with multiple laptops of different thicknesses, look for a range up to 2.5 inches (GodSpin) to cover gaming laptops alongside ultrabooks." },
  { criterion: "Single vs dual vs multi-slot", explanation: "A single slot holds one device and has the smallest footprint. A dual slot holds two devices in less space than two singles. A 3- or 4-slot stand consolidates more devices but takes more desk space. Match slot count to the actual number of devices you leave on the desk daily." },
  { criterion: "Warranty length", explanation: "Lifetime warranties (OMOTON) indicate brand confidence in long-term product quality. Five-year warranties (Psitek) are the next tier. No warranty means no recourse for defects that appear after normal use." },
  { criterion: "Cable management", explanation: "Passive stands without cable cutouts require separate cable routing. Stands with a built-in cable cutout (UGREEN) route charging cables through the base cleanly. In desk setups where cable visibility matters, the cutout is a practical advantage." },
];

const BC_FOOTRESTS = [
  { criterion: "Adjustable height vs fixed", explanation: "A fixed footrest works when your desk and chair height never change. An adjustable footrest covers multiple chair heights, different desk configurations, and shared desks. If you sit at the same chair and desk daily, a quality fixed footrest is simpler and often cheaper." },
  { criterion: "Foam type", explanation: "Memory foam conforms to foot shape and feels softer but compresses over months of daily use. High-density foam (ErgoFoam) is firmer and holds its shape longer. Dual-layer foam (BlissTrends) combines soft top feel with a firmer base for both comfort and longevity." },
  { criterion: "Rocking vs stationary", explanation: "Rocking footrests (StrongTek, Everlasting Comfort) activate calf and ankle muscles during long desk sessions, which improves circulation compared to holding feet static. Stationary footrests provide consistent support for users who want no movement underfoot." },
  { criterion: "Massage surface", explanation: "Massage roller strips (HUANUO, CasaZenith) add a circulation benefit that flat foam surfaces cannot provide. The rollers are most useful for users who experience foot fatigue during long desk sessions. Flat surfaces are quieter and easier to clean." },
  { criterion: "Size and desk clearance", explanation: "Measure the open space between your feet and the underside of the desk before purchasing. Standard footrests fit most desk clearances, but sit-stand desk converters and height-adjustable desks sometimes have lower clearance at certain heights. Also check width: a wider footrest lets you shift foot position during the day." },
];

const BC_LAP_DESKS_BED = [
  { criterion: "Hard vs soft top surface", explanation: "The single most important factor is whether the top surface is hard or soft. Soft fabric or foam top surfaces allow laptop bottom vents to be partially blocked. A hard MDF or wood surface keeps vents completely clear regardless of how the laptop sits on it. All recommended picks use hard surfaces." },
  { criterion: "Adjustability level", explanation: "Fixed cushion boards (one position) are sufficient for upright sitting. Angle-only adjustable models reduce neck strain for video watching. Height-plus-angle models (SAIJI) support sitting, semi-reclined, and fully reclined positions. Choose based on how many different postures you actually use." },
  { criterion: "Cushion base type", explanation: "Standard foam compresses fastest. Microbead fill (LapGear Designer) conforms better and lasts longer. Bolster cushions (LapGear Pro) provide structured support on the outer edges of both thighs. Thicker foam (GORILLA GRIP) provides more padding but is heavier." },
  { criterion: "Surface width vs laptop size", explanation: "A 15-inch laptop needs at least a 17-inch wide surface. A 17-inch laptop needs at least a 19-inch surface. Add 5 to 7 inches over the laptop width if you want to use an external mouse on the same surface. Check the spec width, not the displayed laptop compatibility range." },
  { criterion: "Foldable legs and storage", explanation: "Non-folding lap desks take up permanent space in a small bedroom. Foldable leg designs (SAIJI Foldable) collapse flat for under-mattress storage. If storage space is limited, a foldable design is practical enough to justify over a fixed board of similar specs." },
];

const BC_LAP_DESKS_CUSHION = [
  { criterion: "Cushion fill type", explanation: "Standard polyester foam compresses fastest with daily use. Microbead fill (LapGear Designer) conforms to leg shape, stays cooler than foam, and lasts longer without permanent compression. Memory foam (SOFIA + SAM) provides the best pressure distribution but will eventually compress. Bean bag fill lasts longest but is heavier." },
  { criterion: "Cushion base coverage", explanation: "Full-width cushions that span the lap desk provide even support across both thighs. Bolster-style dual cushions (LapGear Pro) support the outer edges with a gap in the middle for better airflow between thighs. Choose based on which contact pattern is more comfortable for your leg width." },
  { criterion: "Wrist rest presence", explanation: "An integrated wrist rest along the front edge reduces wrist extension angle during typing. It is positioned at a fixed height relative to the surface. If you type frequently in bed or on the sofa, a wrist rest is worth specifically selecting for rather than treating as an optional bonus." },
  { criterion: "Adjustability with cushion", explanation: "Most cushioned lap desks are fixed position. The LapGear Ergonomic Pro 2.0 combines microbead cushion with 9 height positions. SAIJI models combine height and angle with a cushion base. If you need both cushion comfort and position adjustment, specifically filter for this combination." },
  { criterion: "Cover washability", explanation: "Removable and machine-washable cushion covers extend the usable life of the lap desk significantly. Non-removable covers require spot cleaning. For lap desks used in bed regularly, a washable cover is a practical requirement rather than a nice-to-have feature." },
];

const BC_LAP_DESKS_LAPTOPS = [
  { criterion: "Hard vs soft top surface", explanation: "The most critical factor: any lap desk used for laptops must have a hard top surface. Soft fabric or foam surfaces allow laptop vents to be partially blocked, causing thermal throttling and long-term hardware stress. All hard-surface lap desks protect the laptop; all soft surfaces risk it." },
  { criterion: "Width vs actual laptop size", explanation: "Measure your laptop width (not the screen diagonal). A 15.6-inch screen laptop is typically 14 to 14.5 inches wide. Add at least 2 inches on each side for comfortable placement. A 17-inch screen laptop typically needs at least a 19-inch wide surface." },
  { criterion: "Mouse pad integration", explanation: "If you use an external mouse, an integrated mouse pad (LapGear Pro, HUANUO 17-inch) eliminates the problem of balancing a separate mouse pad on the remaining surface area. Without integrated mouse pad, you either need a wider desk or a mouse that works on the laptop chassis area." },
  { criterion: "Ventilation for thermal management", explanation: "Hard flat surfaces keep vents clear but do not actively improve airflow. Ventilated surfaces with holes or gaps allow passive airflow below the laptop. For gaming laptops or sustained workload use that causes thermal throttling, active ventilation is worth the additional cost." },
  { criterion: "Adjustability for posture", explanation: "Flat fixed desks suit upright seated use at standard seat height. Angle-adjustable models reduce neck strain for reading and video. Height-plus-angle adjustable models (SAIJI) work for users who use their laptop across multiple positions on the sofa or in bed during a single session." },

    buyingCriteria: BC_FOOTRESTS,
    faq: [
      { q: "Do under-desk footrests actually help with posture?", a: "Yes, when feet dangle without reaching the floor the thigh pressure on the seat edge reduces circulation and increases lower back tension. A footrest restores the natural foot-to-floor contact angle without requiring desk or chair height changes, which directly reduces the fatigue from dangling feet." },
      { q: "What height footrest do I need?", a: "The correct height depends on your chair and desk combination. With your chair at the proper height for your desk, measure the gap between your feet and the floor. That measurement is your target footrest height. Most standard under-desk footrests provide 2 to 4 inches of lift, which covers most common desk and chair combinations." },
      { q: "Are rocking footrests better than flat ones?", a: "Rocking footrests actively engage calf muscles and improve circulation, which is beneficial for users who sit for long consecutive hours. Flat stationary footrests provide consistent elevation and are quieter. For users who find active foot movement distracting, a flat footrest is the better choice." },
      { q: "Can I use a footrest at a standing desk?", a: "Yes. At a sitting height, a footrest works normally. The ErgoFoam XL is specifically designed for users whose standing desk is set to a taller sitting height or who use a bar stool at a standing desk. For standard floor-level sitting, the standard height footrests are sufficient." },
      { q: "How long do foam footrests last?", a: "High-density foam footrests (ErgoFoam) maintain their shape for 2 to 3 years of daily use. Standard memory foam compresses faster, typically within 1 to 2 years. Wood rockers (StrongTek) last indefinitely as wood does not compress. Removable and washable covers extend the usable life of foam footrests by keeping the cover in good condition." },

The stands listed here adjust from under 0.5 inches to over 2.5 inches of slot width, which covers nearly all consumer laptops including older thicker models and current thin ultrabooks." },
      { q: "How do you use a laptop in a vertical stand?", a: "Close the laptop lid and place it in the vertical stand. Connect an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the laptop. The laptop enters clamshell mode automatically and operates normally with the external display as the primary screen. The built-in laptop display turns off in clamshell mode." },
      { q: "Are vertical laptop stands bad for laptops?", a: "No. Vertical storage does not damage laptop hardware, displays, or batteries. The thermal design of modern laptops handles vertical orientation without overheating. All stands in this roundup include protective silicone padding at contact points to prevent chassis scratching." },
      { q: "What is the difference between a laptop stand and a laptop riser?", a: "A vertical stand holds the laptop in portrait orientation for clamshell desk use. A riser elevates the laptop at a horizontal angle to raise the screen to eye level for direct laptop screen use. They solve different problems: vertical stands store the laptop out of the way; risers bring the screen to ergonomic height." },
      { q: "Can a vertical stand hold a laptop while it is charging?", a: "Yes. The laptop charges normally in a vertical stand as long as the charging cable reaches the port. Most vertical stands leave the charging port side open. Stands with cable cutouts (UGREEN) route the cable more cleanly through the base." },

    buyingCriteria: [
      { criterion: "MacBook-specific vs universal fit", explanation: "Dedicated MacBook stands (HumanCentric, Twelve South BookArc) use model-specific silicone inserts that fit the MacBook at precise contact points without pressure on the hinge. Universal adjustable stands (OMOTON, Psitek, UGREEN) fit any laptop but require manual width adjustment. Dedicated stands look more intentional; universal stands work if you switch laptops." },
      { criterion: "Aluminum vs walnut material", explanation: "Aluminum stands (OMOTON, Psitek, UGREEN) match the MacBook chassis material and color closely. Walnut stands (UPERGO) add natural wood warmth that pairs better with wooden desk surfaces. Both materials protect the laptop at contact points." },
      { criterion: "Single vs dual slot", explanation: "A single slot stores the MacBook and nothing else. A dual slot stores the MacBook plus a second device (iPad, second MacBook, iPhone stand). If you manage only one Apple laptop, a single slot has a smaller footprint. For two devices, dual costs less than two separate stands." },
      { criterion: "Adjustment range for MacBook models", explanation: "MacBook Air 13-inch and 15-inch are approximately 0.44 inches thick. MacBook Pro 14-inch is 0.61 inches thick. MacBook Pro 16-inch is 0.66 inches thick. Older Intel MacBook Pro models can be 0.92 inches thick. Make sure the stand's minimum slot width accommodates the thinnest MacBook you own." },
      { criterion: "Warranty length", explanation: "Lifetime warranties (OMOTON) and 5-year warranties (Psitek) indicate the manufacturer expects the stand to outlast normal ownership cycles. MacBook-dedicated stands (HumanCentric) include lifetime warranty to match the premium positioning." },

    faq: [
      { q: "Can I use a vertical stand with a MacBook in clamshell mode?", a: "Yes. Clamshell mode is the primary use case for a vertical MacBook stand. Connect an external display, keyboard, and mouse, close the MacBook lid, and place it in the stand. The MacBook remains powered and drives the external display while the built-in screen stays off." },
      { q: "Do I need a MacBook-specific stand or will a universal stand work?", a: "Universal adjustable stands (OMOTON, Psitek) work correctly with all MacBook models. MacBook-specific stands (HumanCentric, Twelve South BookArc) provide a more precise fit and often a cleaner aesthetic, but universal stands hold the MacBook securely without any compromise." },
      { q: "Which MacBook models fit the Twelve South BookArc?", a: "The Twelve South BookArc comes with three interchangeable silicone inserts sized for different MacBook thicknesses. It fits MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. Check the current product listing for the specific insert sizes included, as they vary by product generation." },
      { q: "Will a vertical stand scratch my MacBook?", a: "All stands in this roundup use silicone-covered contact points that protect the MacBook chassis from scratching. The MacBook-specific stands (HumanCentric, Twelve South BookArc) use precision-fit inserts that contact only the safe areas of the laptop. Universal stands use adjustable silicone pads." },
      { q: "Can I put a MacBook with a case in a vertical stand?", a: "Most adjustable vertical stands accommodate a MacBook with a thin case as long as the case thickness stays within the stand's adjustment range. MacBook-specific stands with fixed-size inserts may not accommodate thick cases. Check the maximum slot width against your MacBook-plus-case thickness." },

    buyingCriteria: [
      { criterion: "Independent slot adjustment", explanation: "Stands with independently adjustable slots (OMOTON dual, Psitek dual) let each slot hold a device of a different thickness. Fixed-pitch dual stands require both devices to be similar in size. If your two devices are different thicknesses, independent adjustment is necessary rather than optional." },
      { criterion: "Material quality for daily use", explanation: "Aluminum dual stands (OMOTON, Psitek, UGREEN) maintain adjustment position after repeated daily insertion and removal. ABS plastic slot mechanisms loosen faster. For a stand you use every day, aluminum pays back its small premium within a few months of reliable use." },
      { criterion: "Base stability for two devices", explanation: "A dual stand holds more weight than a single. Check that the base is wide enough and weighted enough not to tip when both slots are loaded. The UGREEN dual uses a weighted base specifically for dual-device stability." },
      { criterion: "Slot count and device type", explanation: "Dual stands hold two devices. 4-in-1 stands (Vaydeer) hold two laptops plus a phone and tablet. Match the slot count to your actual devices: if you only need two laptop slots, a dual stand is simpler and takes less space than a 4-in-1." },
      { criterion: "Rotation for shared desks", explanation: "The OMOTON VL04 rotating base allows repositioning the dual stand to any desk angle without lifting it. This is useful for shared desk setups or ergonomic positions where the stand needs to face different directions. Fixed-base stands require manual lifting to reposition." },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: "Do both slots need to hold the same size laptop?", a: "No. Stands with independent per-slot adjustment (OMOTON dual, Psitek dual, UGREEN dual) let each slot hold a different size device. You can store a thin MacBook Air in one slot and a thicker 15-inch Windows laptop in the other at the same time." },
      { q: "How do I choose between a dual stand and two single stands?", a: "A dual stand takes less desk space than two single stands and costs less than buying two singles at similar quality. Two singles offer more placement flexibility if the devices are on opposite sides of the desk. For most desk setups, a dual stand is the more efficient choice." },
      { q: "What is the maximum laptop size for dual stands?", a: "Most dual vertical stands in this roundup hold laptops up to 17 inches per slot. The limiting factor is usually slot width (for device thickness) rather than height, since devices of different heights all fit in the vertical orientation." },
      { q: "Can I mix a laptop and a tablet in a dual stand?", a: "Yes. Tablets like iPad Pro are typically 0.23 to 0.25 inches thick, well within the minimum slot width of all stands in this roundup. Most users with a dual stand store a laptop in one slot and an iPad or second device in the other." },
      { q: "Is a 4-in-1 stand better than a dual stand?", a: "A 4-in-1 organizer stores more devices but the phone and tablet slots are often smaller fixed-width openings. If you only need two laptop slots, a dual stand is more stable and purpose-built. If you genuinely need to store four devices, the Vaydeer 4-in-1 is the practical choice." },

Friction-only mechanisms can slip over time. Look for a visible screw or knob adjustment that positively locks the slot width at the set position." },
      { criterion: "Adjustment range", explanation: "Most consumer laptops fall between 0.44 and 0.85 inches thick. A range covering 0.47 to 1.65 inches handles this with room. For households with gaming laptops, workstations, or older thick laptops alongside thin ultrabooks, the GodSpin's 0.4 to 2.5-inch range is the correct choice." },
      { criterion: "Single vs multi-slot", explanation: "A single-slot adjustable stand is simpler and has a smaller footprint. Multi-slot adjustable stands (OMOTON dual, UGREEN dual, Vaydeer 3-in-1) hold multiple devices with independent per-slot adjustment. Match slot count to the number of devices you need to store." },
      { criterion: "Material for daily adjustment", explanation: "Aluminum adjustment mechanisms maintain calibration longer than ABS over repeated daily adjustments. For a stand you adjust seasonally (switching between laptops), ABS is acceptable. For daily adjustment of two different devices, aluminum is more reliable." },
      { criterion: "Special adjustment features", explanation: "The SODI auto-lock uses gravity-activated gripping that requires no manual adjustment at all. The OMOTON VL04 adds 360-degree base rotation. The UGREEN adds cable routing. These secondary features can matter more than the basic adjustment range depending on use case." },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: "How do I adjust a vertical laptop stand?", a: "For screw-lock stands (OMOTON, Psitek, UGREEN), place the device in the slot without tightening, then finger-tighten the knurled screw until the slot grips the device without play. For auto-lock stands (SODI), simply place the device and the mechanism engages automatically." },
      { q: "Will the adjustment loosen over time?", a: "Screw-lock aluminum mechanisms maintain their set position reliably with normal use. Friction-only mechanisms may loosen after extended use. If your stand's slot feels loose after a few months, inspect whether it has a locking screw that needs retightening versus a friction-only design that is beginning to wear." },
      { q: "What adjustment range do I need for a gaming laptop?", a: "Most 15.6-inch gaming laptops are 0.9 to 1.3 inches thick. Thick 17-inch gaming workstations can be 1.6 to 2.5 inches. The GodSpin with 0.4 to 2.5-inch range covers all of these. Standard stands capped at 1.65 inches may not accommodate the thickest gaming models." },
      { q: "Can I adjust the stand with the laptop already inside?", a: "Most screw-lock stands require you to either remove the device or loosen the screw with one hand while holding the device with the other. Auto-lock stands (SODI) require no adjustment at all. For frequent device swaps between differently sized devices, auto-lock or a very easy knob mechanism reduces friction." },
      { q: "Is a wider adjustment range always better?", a: "A wider range accommodates more device sizes, which is useful if you own laptops of very different thicknesses. If you own one laptop and never plan to change, a stand calibrated to a narrower range is not worse. The GodSpin's 0.4 to 2.5-inch range is the most versatile, not necessarily the best for a single thin laptop user." },

      { criterion: "Desk aesthetic match", explanation: "Aluminum stands in silver or space gray complement modern minimal desk setups. Black aluminum matches black desk accessories and monitors. Walnut stands complement wood desk surfaces. Choose deliberately based on your existing desk palette rather than defaulting to silver." },
      { criterion: "Footprint behind the monitor", explanation: "The vertical stand lives permanently behind or beside your monitor in a desk setup. A compact footprint (Psitek single) takes less permanent desk real estate. A 3-slot stand (OMOTON triple) takes more. Measure the available space behind your monitor before choosing a slot count." },
      { criterion: "Cable management at the stand position", explanation: "In a desk setup, the laptop's charging cable and any USB cables run from the stand position to the monitor or dock. Stands with cable cutouts (UGREEN single and dual) route these cables through the base rather than across the surface. For setups where cable routing is visible, this matters." },
      { criterion: "Single vs multi-slot for the number of devices you actually own", explanation: "A single stand is correct if you have one laptop. A dual stand is correct for a work laptop plus personal laptop or laptop plus iPad. A 3-slot stand consolidates three devices. Overbuying slot count adds footprint without benefit; underbuying means you still need a second stand." },
      { criterion: "Warranty as a long-term desk investment", explanation: "Unlike a lap desk or portable accessory, a desk setup vertical stand stays in one place permanently. Lifetime warranties (OMOTON) and 5-year warranties (Psitek) carry more practical value in a permanent placement context where you rely on the stand daily without rechecking it." },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: "Where should I place a vertical laptop stand in my desk setup?", a: "The most common placement is to the side of the primary monitor, on the same side as the cable cluster. Placing the stand behind the monitor is effective for minimizing footprint in front of the desk. The priority is ensuring cables reach the laptop comfortably from the stand position without excess cable length." },
      { q: "Does a vertical laptop stand affect desk cable management?", a: "A vertical stand fixes the laptop position, which makes cable routing more deliberate. Stands with cable cutouts (UGREEN) route the charging cable through the base, reducing visible cable on the desk surface. Passive stands without this feature do not change cable count but fix the cable entry point." },
      { q: "Should I use clamshell mode with a vertical stand in my desk setup?", a: "Yes. Clamshell mode is the standard configuration for a laptop in a desk setup vertical stand. The laptop lid is closed, the laptop acts as a headless compute unit, and the external monitor, keyboard, and mouse handle all input and output." },
      { q: "Can I use a vertical laptop stand with a monitor arm?", a: "Vertical stands and monitor arms complement each other. The monitor arm frees desk surface by lifting the display; the vertical stand frees desk surface by storing the laptop upright. Together they maximize usable surface area for keyboard and accessories." },
      { q: "How many devices should my desk setup stand hold?", a: "The correct slot count matches the number of devices you leave on the desk simultaneously. If you have one laptop and nothing else, a single slot is sufficient. If you alternate between a work and personal laptop, dual is correct. If you also need to store an iPad or tablet vertically, choose a 3-in-1 or 4-in-1 stand." },

    faq: [
      { q: "Is it safe to use a laptop in bed with a lap desk?", a: "Using a hard-surface lap desk in bed is safer than placing the laptop directly on bedding. Soft bedding blocks laptop bottom vents and causes overheating. A lap desk elevates the laptop off the bed surface with a hard base that keeps vents completely clear, which protects both the laptop hardware and your legs from heat." },
      { q: "What size lap desk do I need for a 15-inch laptop?", a: "A lap desk with at least a 17-inch wide surface comfortably holds a 15-inch laptop with clearance on both sides. For a 17-inch gaming laptop, choose at least a 19-inch wide surface. Add extra width if you also want to use an external mouse on the same surface." },
      { q: "Do adjustable lap desks work while lying down?", a: "Height-plus-angle adjustable models (SAIJI XL, SAIJI medium) work in multiple reclining positions including semi-reclined and near-horizontal. Fixed-height cushion boards work best for upright sitting. If you use your laptop in bed from multiple positions, an adjustable model is worth the premium." },
      { q: "How do I store a lap desk in a small bedroom?", a: "Foldable leg lap desks (SAIJI Foldable) collapse flat and store under a mattress or standing in a closet. Non-folding models like cushion boards are thinner and can often stand on end in a corner. The SAIJI XL with legs is the most space-consuming when not folded." },
      { q: "Can I use a lap desk on a sofa?", a: "Yes. Lap desks designed for bed use work equally well on sofas and armchairs. The cushioned base adapts to sofa cushion surfaces in the same way it adapts to mattress surfaces. Height-adjustable models work on sofas by adjusting to the lower typical sofa seat height." },

    buyingCriteria: BC_LAP_DESKS_CUSHION,
    faq: [
      { q: "What is the best cushion type for a lap desk?", a: "Microbead fill (LapGear Designer) conforms to leg shape, stays cooler than foam, and maintains its loft longer without permanent compression. Memory foam (SOFIA + SAM) provides the best pressure distribution but compresses over time. Standard polyester foam is the most common and least expensive but compresses fastest with daily use." },
      { q: "Do lap desk cushions make legs hot?", a: "Cushioned bases insulate between the laptop and your legs, which reduces direct heat transfer from the laptop surface. Dense foam cushions retain more heat than microbead or bolster-style bases. Bolster cushions with a gap in the middle allow more airflow between the thighs, which is cooler than a continuous foam base." },
      { q: "Are lap desk cushion covers washable?", a: "Most cushion lap desks have removable fabric covers over the cushion base that are machine washable. The hard surface top is wiped clean with a damp cloth. Check the product specifications for cover removal and washability before purchasing if this is a priority for your use case." },
      { q: "What is the difference between a wrist rest and a cushion base on a lap desk?", a: "The cushion base is on the underside of the lap desk and rests on your lap. The wrist rest is on the top surface at the front edge in front of the keyboard area. They serve different functions: cushion base manages pressure and heat between the desk and your legs; wrist rest reduces wrist extension strain during typing." },
      { q: "How long do lap desk cushions last?", a: "Microbead fill lasts the longest, typically 3 to 5 years before noticeable compression. Memory foam lasts 1 to 2 years before developing a permanent impression. Standard polyester foam compresses within 1 year of daily use. Bolster-style cushions depend on foam density but typically fall between microbead and standard foam." },

    faq: [
      { q: "Why do I need a lap desk for my laptop?", a: "Placing a laptop directly on soft surfaces like a mattress, pillow, or thick fabric blocks the bottom vents. Laptops pull cool air from the bottom and exhaust warm air from the sides or rear. A hard-surface lap desk elevates the laptop off the soft surface, keeps vents clear, prevents thermal throttling, and protects legs from laptop-generated heat." },
      { q: "What makes a lap desk good for laptops specifically?", a: "The most important feature is a hard flat surface rather than a soft one. A hard surface keeps laptop vents unobstructed regardless of how the laptop sits. Secondary features that benefit laptop users include a wrist rest for typing comfort, an integrated mouse pad if you use an external mouse, and sufficient width for the laptop model." },
      { q: "Does laptop size matter for choosing a lap desk?", a: "Yes. Measure your laptop's actual width, not just the screen size. A 15.6-inch screen laptop is typically 14 to 14.5 inches wide. A 17-inch screen laptop is 15 to 15.8 inches wide. The lap desk surface must be wider than the laptop for stable placement. Add extra width if you want an external mouse on the same surface." },
      { q: "Can I use a lap desk with a laptop stand?", a: "A lap desk solves the problem of using a laptop in your lap. A vertical laptop stand solves the problem of storing a closed laptop on a desk. They address different scenarios and are not used simultaneously. If you use a laptop at a desk in clamshell mode, a vertical stand is the correct accessory, not a lap desk." },
      { q: "What is the best lap desk for a 17-inch gaming laptop?", a: "A 17-inch gaming laptop needs at minimum a 19-inch wide surface, which most standard lap desks do not provide. The SAIJI XL with its larger surface and height adjustment for the thermal load of gaming is the most practical choice. The wishacc XL 24-inch is the alternative for maximum surface area if the SAIJI's price is acceptable." },
