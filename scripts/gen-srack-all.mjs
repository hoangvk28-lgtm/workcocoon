const sharedFaqPool = [
  { key: "rail-depth-nominal-height", q: "Does a rack's U-height tell me whether my server will actually fit?", a: "No. U-height only measures vertical rack space. Whether a server physically fits also depends on the rail-to-rail mounting depth and the clearance behind the rack for cables and rear panel access, so check adjustable depth range separately from U-height before buying." },
  { key: "stationary-rolling-wall-load", q: "Is a rack's weight capacity the same whether it's on wheels, on the floor, or on a wall?", a: "No. Manufacturers document these as separate ratings, and they can differ substantially, a rack rated for 500 lbs stationary might drop to 300-400 lbs on casters, and a wall-mount rating is typically far lower than either floor option since it depends on the wall structure, not just the rack." },
  { key: "wall-anchor-limits", q: "If a wall-mount rack is rated for 130 lbs, can I always mount it at that weight?", a: "Only if the wall itself can support it. The rack's rating assumes a solid structural mounting point like wall studs; drywall alone typically can't support a fully loaded network cabinet, so the wall's actual construction, not just the rack's spec sheet, sets the real limit." },
  { key: "2post-vs-4post", q: "What's the practical difference between a 2-post and 4-post rack?", a: "A 4-post rack supports equipment along its full depth with front and rear rails, making it suitable for heavier servers and full-depth chassis, while a 2-post rack only supports the front mounting points, which works fine for lighter switches and patch panels but isn't rated for deep, heavy server hardware." },
  { key: "rack-fan-sealed-room", q: "Will adding fans to my server rack cool down a small closet or sealed room?", a: "Not by itself. Rack fans move air within or around the enclosure, but if the room itself has no way to exhaust heat, the fans are just recirculating warm air. A genuinely sealed space needs either room-level ventilation or a dedicated cooling unit, not just rack-mounted fans." },
  { key: "pdu-branch-circuit", q: "Do I need to think about my home's electrical circuit before adding a rack PDU?", a: "Yes, especially for a dense home lab. A PDU distributes outlets but doesn't increase how much power your branch circuit can actually deliver, so total continuous load across all rack equipment should stay well under the circuit's rated capacity to avoid nuisance trips or, worse, an overloaded circuit." },
  { key: "home-rack-noise-heat", q: "Why do server racks marketed for home use specifically mention noise levels?", a: "Because a rack living in a bedroom, office, or shared living space needs to be judged on more than raw performance. Fan noise and heat output that would be unremarkable in a dedicated server room can be genuinely disruptive in a home, so noise dBA ratings and passive cooling options matter more for home lab buyers than for commercial installs." },

Whether a server physically fits also depends on rail-to-rail mounting depth and rear clearance for cables, so check the adjustable depth range separately from the U-height figure." },
        { q: "Is a taller rack always better if I have the ceiling clearance?", a: "Not necessarily. A taller rack costs more, takes longer to assemble, and can be harder to secure against tipping if it's not anchored, so match the height to genuine current and near-future equipment needs rather than maximizing size." },

        { q: "Why do wall cabinets list a lower weight rating than floor cabinets of the same size?", a: "Because wall-mounted capacity is limited by what the wall structure itself can bear, not just what the cabinet frame could theoretically hold.

A genuinely sealed space needs either room-level ventilation or an actual air conditioning unit." },

Sound dampening trades off against airflow, so a sealed quiet cabinet needs a genuinely capable internal cooling system, otherwise trapped heat can become a bigger problem than the original noise." },
        { q: "Does a rack's noise rating account for fan speed under load?", a: "Not always. Some noise reduction claims are measured at idle or a fixed low speed, so check whether the documented dBA figure applies specifically under real operating load, since fans typically get louder as equipment runs hotter." },
