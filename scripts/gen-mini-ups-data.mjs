That's enough rails to run a router and a separate 9V or 12V device off the same unit without an adapter.",
    p2: "Amazon doesn't list a nominal wattage badge, and the seller is explicit that no standalone lithium batteries ship separately from the unit, so factor shipping restrictions into timing if you're ordering close to an outage. The five-layer protection stack (short circuit, voltage fluctuation, overcharge, over-discharge, temperature) is standard for this category rather than a differentiator.",

TalentCell caps continuous draw at 37W and is explicit that pushing past it will drain the pack fast rather than protect the load.",
    p2: "The DC ports use a 5.5x2.1mm barrel, which fits most routers but not all; TalentCell tells buyers up front to check their device's port size before ordering since a mismatched connector needs a separate cable.

The PoE output can carry both power and data over a single Ethernet run for supported gear.",

  { criterion: "Match voltage before capacity", explanation: "Check your router's power adapter label for its exact output voltage (usually 5V, 9V, or 12V) and current draw in amps before comparing battery capacity. A mini UPS with the wrong voltage can damage the router even if the plug physically fits." },
  { criterion: "Convert mAh to Wh to compare fairly", explanation: "A 20,000mAh unit built around a 3.7V cell and a 10,400mAh unit built around a higher-voltage pack can carry similar real energy. Look for a watt-hour (Wh) figure in the listing, or multiply mAh by pack voltage and divide by 1000, before ranking products by capacity alone." },
  { criterion: "Confirm connector size and polarity", explanation: "Most of these units use a 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC barrel connector, but not all do, and center-pin polarity (positive vs negative tip) varies by brand even at the same voltage. A mismatched polarity can damage the router on first use." },
  { criterion: "Check the combined wattage ceiling, not just per-port ratings", explanation: "Multi-output units rarely guarantee every port can deliver its maximum rating simultaneously. If you're powering a router and a modem or camera off the same UPS, add up both devices' wattage and compare it against the unit's stated total output ceiling, not the sum of each port's individual maximum." },
  { criterion: "Don't trust advertised runtime hours at face value", explanation: "Manufacturer runtime claims ('up to 5 hours') are usually measured against a specific, often low, wattage load. A router pulling 10-15W will drain a battery meaningfully faster than the manufacturer's test load. Treat published hours as a best case, not a guarantee." },
  { criterion: "Passive PoE is not the same as active PoE", explanation: "A handful of these units output passive PoE (a fixed voltage sent down unused Ethernet pairs) rather than IEEE 802.3af/at active PoE with negotiation. Passive PoE only works with equipment designed for it; plugging an active-PoE device into a passive-PoE mini UPS can damage the device." },

    { q: "Can a mini UPS damage my router if I pick the wrong voltage?", a: "Yes. Most of these units offer multiple output rails at different voltages (5V, 9V, 12V), and plugging a router rated for one voltage into an output rated for another can damage the device even if the connector physically fits. Always match the exact voltage printed on your router's original power adapter." },
    { q: "How long will a mini UPS actually power my router?", a: "It depends on your router's real power draw and the battery's watt-hours, not the manufacturer's advertised 'hours' figure alone, which is usually based on a specific test load. A typical home router drawing 8-12W will run roughly 2-4 hours on an 18-38Wh unit and considerably longer on a 74-97Wh unit like the TalentCell." },
    { q: "Is passive PoE the same as the PoE on my network switch?", a: "No. Most PoE switches and cameras use IEEE 802.3af/at active PoE, which negotiates voltage with the connected device. The passive PoE output on units like the CHINTE and ALFOINE sends a fixed voltage regardless of what's plugged in, and is only safe with equipment specifically designed for passive PoE input." },
