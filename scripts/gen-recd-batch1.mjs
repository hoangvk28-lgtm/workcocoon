  { key: "raid-storage-lock", q: "Do reception desks with storage always include a lock?", a: "No. Many listings include one lockable drawer alongside open shelving or cabinets, but not every storage compartment locks. Check the specific listing for which drawers or cabinets are lockable versus open before assuming full document security." },
  { key: "grommet-cable", q: "Does a cable grommet hole guarantee tidy cable management?", a: "A grommet hole only creates a pass-through point for wires; it does not route or organize cables on its own. Desks with a dedicated cable trough, baffle, or labeled routing path keep cords genuinely tidy, while a bare grommet hole still requires the buyer to manage the run themselves." },
  { key: "counter-height-ada", q: "Is a raised transaction counter automatically ADA accessible?", a: "No. ADA accessibility depends on the installed counter height, approach type (forward or parallel), and surrounding clear floor space meeting current DOJ standards, not just the presence of a lower shelf. A desk marketed as having an accessible section should still be verified against the installed layout." },
  { key: "assembly-package", q: "Why do some reception desks ship in two separate boxes?", a: "Larger reception desks, especially those over roughly 70 inches, often ship in two packages to protect components during transit and reduce the risk of a single oversized box being damaged. The two boxes can arrive on different days, so it's worth waiting for both before starting assembly." },
  { key: "mdf-vs-solid", q: "Is MDF or particle board construction a problem for a reception desk?", a: "Not inherently. High-density MDF and particle board are standard in this category and hold up well to daily commercial use when finished with a scratch- and water-resistant laminate or paint layer. Solid wood or steel-reinforced builds cost more and matter most for higher-traffic or heavier-load installations." },
  { key: "warranty-length", q: "What warranty should I expect on a reception desk?", a: "Warranty terms vary widely in this category, from no stated warranty on some budget listings to a 1-year warranty on mid-range desks and multi-year coverage on commercial-grade systems from established office furniture brands. Check the specific listing rather than assuming a standard term." },
  { key: "led-power", q: "Do built-in LED lights and power outlets need a separate power source?", a: "Yes, desks with integrated LED strips or charging outlets need to be plugged into a standard wall outlet near the installation point; they are not battery-powered. Confirm an outlet is within reach of the desk's power cord before installation." },
  { key: "weight-capacity", q: "How much weight can a typical reception desk desktop hold?", a: "Weight capacity varies by construction, with many MDF and particleboard desks in this category rated between 200 and 250 lbs, and steel-reinforced or commercial-grade desks rated higher. Check the specific listing's weight rating if you plan to place heavy equipment like a large monitor array or point-of-sale hardware." },

      { q: "Should I buy a reception desk with or without a raised counter?", a: "A raised transaction counter is worth it if visitors regularly sign documents, hand over payment, or need a surface at standing height; for offices where visitors mostly just check in verbally, a flat-front desk without a counter is simpler and cheaper." },

      { q: "Does an L-shaped reception desk need more floor space than a straight desk?", a: "Yes, meaningfully.

      { q: "Can I add an accessible section to an existing non-accessible reception desk?", a: "Some modular reception systems, like the Romig Marque units in this comparison, are designed as standalone or add-on components specifically so an accessible section can be added onto an existing non-accessible desk run later." },
      { q: "What's the difference between forward and parallel wheelchair approach?", a: "A forward approach means a wheelchair user faces the counter directly, requiring specific knee and toe clearance beneath it. A parallel approach means the user is positioned alongside the counter. The required counter height and clear floor space differ between the two, so the installation needs to match the intended approach type." },
      { q: "Is a lowered shelf enough to make a reception desk ADA compliant?", a: "Not by itself. A lowered shelf needs to meet the specific height, knee clearance, and approach requirements in current DOJ standards; a shelf that's simply lower than the main counter without meeting those exact specifications does not automatically satisfy ADA requirements." },

    faq: [
      { q: "How can I tell if a reception desk is solid wood or veneer?", a: "Check the product listing's material description closely; solid wood desks typically state \"solid wood\" explicitly, while veneer or laminate desks describe an engineered wood or MDF core with a wood-look surface finish. Weight is also a clue, solid wood desks are noticeably heavier." },
      { q: "Can a wood-veneer reception desk be refinished if it gets scratched?", a: "It depends on the veneer thickness. A genuine wood veneer can sometimes be lightly sanded and refinished, but a printed wood-look laminate generally cannot be refinished and would need a replacement panel or professional touch-up instead." },
      { q: "Is solid wood construction worth the extra cost for a reception desk?", a: "It depends on your priorities. Solid wood offers better long-term repairability and a more premium feel, but veneer and laminate desks cost significantly less and perform well for typical daily commercial use if properly finished and cared for." },

Check the finish type and, where available, manufacturer durability claims." },
      { q: "Are white reception desks harder to keep clean than darker colors?", a: "Fingerprints and scuffs are generally more visible on white surfaces than on darker or textured finishes, so a white desk in a high-traffic lobby needs more frequent wipe-downs to stay looking fresh." },
