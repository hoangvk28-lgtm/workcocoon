## Article 1: Best Thunderbolt 4 Docking Stations

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. TB4 Certification vs USB4: The "Will Work" vs "Should Work" Distinction**
- Thunderbolt 4 requires Intel certification, rigorous testing -- guaranteed 40Gbps, dual 4K, daisy-chain support
- USB4 has no mandatory certification -- a USB4 device may run at 20Gbps OR 40Gbps, support one or zero external displays, and skip daisy-chain entirely
- AMD Ryzen AI 300 ships with USB4 v2 (80Gbps) -- NOT Thunderbolt -- causing compatibility gaps when buyers connect TB4-optimized peripherals

**2. The TB4 Daisy-Chain Feature -- Never Fully Explained**
- TB4 supports daisy-chaining up to 6 devices (dock + monitor + SSD + etc.) on one cable
- Each device in the chain reduces available bandwidth downstream
- Practical limit: dock + one SSD + one display before bandwidth becomes constrained

**3. Thunderbolt 5 Planning: Should You Wait?**
- TB5 docks (80Gbps, 140W PD) started shipping in 2024-2025 but very few laptops support it
- TB4 dock works with TB5 laptop at TB4 speeds (backward compatible) -- no need to wait
- Exception: M4 MacBook Pro with 120Gbps bandwidth boost needs TB5 dock to unlock full speed

**4. Power Delivery Overhead**
- A dock rated "100W PD" typically delivers 85-90W to the laptop; 10-15W powers dock circuitry
- MacBook Pro 16" needs 100W+ under load -- most TB4 docks fall short by 5-15W

**5. Intel-Only Laptops Get Full Benefit; AMD/ARM Have Limits**
- TB4 native: Intel Core i-series, Intel Core Ultra -- full feature set
- AMD Ryzen 7000+/AI: USB4, not TB4 -- most features work but NOT Intel certification guarantee
- Apple M-series: TB4/TB3 equivalent but under Apple's implementation -- some accessories behave differently

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- "Will Work vs. Should Work" TB4 vs USB4 callout box
- Daisy-chain explanation with realistic device limit
- "Buy Now or Wait for TB5" decision guide
- Effective PD wattage table (rated vs. actual to laptop)

## Article 2: Best 2-Bay NAS for Home Offices

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. True Purchase Cost -- Enclosure + Drives + Network**
- DS223 at ~$200 + 2x 4TB IronWolf ($100 each) = $400 total before setup
- 2.5GbE NAS models need a 2.5GbE-capable router or switch to see speed improvement -- $40-80 extra

**2. RAM Lock-In Problem**
- Value-series models (soldered RAM, 1-2GB): limits simultaneous apps
- Plus-series models (upgradeable DDR4): only these let you add RAM later
- Buyers who plan to add Plex or Surveillance Station later need the upgradeable-RAM model; buying the soldered model creates an early upgrade trap

**3. RAID 1 Trade-Off: Honest Math**
- 2x 4TB in RAID 1 = 4TB usable (not 8TB)
- Buyers wanting 8TB usable need JBOD (no redundancy) or a 4-bay NAS

**4. Synology Drive Compatibility Restrictions (2024+ Models)**
- Synology 2024+ Plus-series models show compatibility warnings for non-Synology drives
- Synology-branded drives avoid these warnings but cost 15-30% more

**5. The BeeStation-style Alternative: When Simpler Is Better**
- A single-drive, cloud-connected NAS with no RAID and no drive purchasing is better for single-user basic backup
- A traditional diskless 2-bay NAS is better for multi-user or drive redundancy

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- True all-in cost table (enclosure + drives + switch if needed)
- RAM comparison with future-proofing recommendation
- RAID 1 usable storage honest math callout
- Synology drive compatibility warning (2024+ models)
- Beginner-friendly single-drive vs. traditional NAS decision guide

## Article 3: Best DisplayLink Docking Stations

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. DisplayLink Color Accuracy Limitation -- Never Disclosed**
- DisplayLink driver intercepts GPU output and compresses it as USB data
- Windows Display Color Calibration tool has NO effect on DisplayLink-connected monitors
- ICC profiles cannot be applied to DisplayLink displays in standard Windows workflow
- Critical for photographers, graphic designers, video editors -- they should NOT use DisplayLink for color-critical work

**2. CPU Performance Tax**
- DisplayLink renders the display using CPU/GPU compression, adding 3-15% CPU load at idle
- On fanless MacBooks or thin-and-light Windows laptops, CPU heat increases with DisplayLink active

**3. macOS Compatibility Breaks After macOS Updates**
- DisplayLink driver updates lag behind major macOS releases by days to weeks
- After a macOS upgrade, DisplayLink monitors may go dark until a new driver ships

**4. DisplayLink vs. USB4/Thunderbolt Native: When to Use Which**
- DisplayLink: use when laptop can't natively drive multiple displays (base M1/M2/M3, older AMD Ryzen)
- Native Thunderbolt: use when color accuracy, low latency, or video editing is required

**5. 4K 60Hz Requires USB 3.0 Connection**
- DisplayLink 4K@60Hz requires USB 3.0 (5Gbps) minimum -- connected via USB 2.0 drops to 1080p or 4K@30Hz

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Color calibration limitation callout (critical for creative professionals)
- CPU overhead disclosure
- macOS update compatibility warning + driver update checklist
- DisplayLink vs. native Thunderbolt: use-case decision matrix
- USB port speed requirement for 4K@60Hz

## Article 4: Best NAS for Automatic Computer Backup

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. AFP Is Dead -- Critical Protocol Change**
- macOS is removing AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) support in macOS 27+
- Older NAS firmware using AFP for Time Machine backups will silently fail after macOS update
- Fix: configure NAS to use SMB3 + Bonjour advertising with Time Machine flag enabled

**2. Time Machine Backup Size Growth -- Nobody Warns You**
- Time Machine uses a sparse bundle disk image that grows automatically over time
- A 512GB MacBook over 3 years can generate 1-2TB of Time Machine history
- NAS quota per backup must be set manually -- without a quota, Time Machine can fill the entire NAS

**3. Active Backup for Business vs Time Machine: Which to Use**
- Synology Active Backup for Business: free app, supports PC/Mac/VMs, full image backup, deduplication -- better for IT/business
- Time Machine on NAS: block-level incremental, native macOS integration -- better for home Mac users

**4. Backup Verification -- The Step Everyone Skips**
- Scheduling automatic backup is only half the task -- backups must be tested to confirm they restore
- Without verification, backups can appear healthy but fail silently due to RAID errors or file corruption

**5. 3-2-1 Backup Rule -- NAS Is Only One Part**
- NAS = local backup (copy 2 on medium 2)
- Still need: original data (copy 1) + offsite backup (copy 3, e.g. cloud)
- NAS alone does not protect against fire, theft, or ransomware

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- AFP removal warning and SMB3 verification steps
- Time Machine sparse bundle growth + quota setup guide
- Active Backup vs Time Machine decision flowchart
- Backup verification reminder (monthly integrity check)
- 3-2-1 backup rule applied to NAS setup

## Article 5: Best Triple-Monitor Docking Stations

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Mac Apple Silicon Cannot Drive 3 Displays Without DisplayLink**
- Base M1/M2/M3: 1 native external display only -- a 3-port dock does NOT override this
- M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro: 2 native external displays; Max: up to 4
- Triple display on ANY base-chip Mac = DisplayLink required for at least 1-2 of the displays

**2. DisplayLink Output Is Not Suitable for Color-Critical Work**
- A setup with one native Thunderbolt display + two DisplayLink displays will have color inconsistency
- Photographers and video editors will notice the DisplayLink displays look different (warmer, shifted) from the native display

**3. Bandwidth Tax on USB Peripherals in Triple-Display Mode**
- Triple 4K@60Hz through DisplayLink consumes significant USB bandwidth
- Connected USB devices (SSD, keyboard, mouse, webcam) on the same USB controller may see slowdowns

**4. Windows Triple-Display: The MST vs. DisplayLink Choice**
- On Windows Thunderbolt 4 laptops: MST (native) can drive 3 displays if the dock supports it -- no drivers, no CPU overhead
- Only some docks support MST triple output; most use DisplayLink for the third display

**5. Power Supply Required -- Not Bus-Powered**
- Triple 4K display output requires dedicated AC power adapter (100W+)
- Bus-powered hubs cannot drive 3 displays at full resolution/refresh

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Mac chip triple-display reality table (what's native vs. what needs DisplayLink by chip)
- Color inconsistency warning for mixed native/DisplayLink triple setups
- MST vs. DisplayLink for Windows users: when each is the better choice
- USB bandwidth impact disclosure for triple-DisplayLink setups
- Power adapter wattage requirement for true 3x 4K@60Hz

## Article 6: Best NAS for Mac and Time Machine Backup

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. AFP Removal Is Coming -- Major Gap in All Guides**
- macOS 27+ removes AFP -- Time Machine over AFP will break
- NAS must be configured with SMB3 + Bonjour/mDNS advertising the Time Machine service
- Older NAS firmware may only advertise AFP -- verify SMB3 is active before buying

**2. Sparse Bundle Size Management**
- Time Machine creates a sparsebundle file that grows automatically
- Default behavior: Time Machine fills the NAS until it runs out of space
- Fix: set a Time Machine quota in the NAS admin panel; recommended quota is 1.5x the Mac's internal storage

**3. Multiple Macs on One NAS**
- Each Mac needs its own Time Machine shared folder with its own quota
- Using a single shared folder for multiple Macs will corrupt backup history

**4. Network Speed Affects Backup Duration**
- Initial Time Machine backup over Wi-Fi for a 512GB Mac = 8-24 hours depending on router
- First backup should be done over Ethernet for speed; incremental backups after that are fine over Wi-Fi

**5. Synology Drive Restrictions on New Models**
- 2024+ Plus models show compatibility warnings for third-party drives
- Brand-name NAS drives (IronWolf, WD Red) work but may show warning flags

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- AFP deprecation warning + SMB3 verification steps
- Sparse bundle quota setup guide (step-by-step)
- Multi-Mac setup: one shared folder per Mac explanation
- First backup via Ethernet recommendation
- Drive compatibility warning for 2024+ models

## Article 7: Best Docking Stations for Two Laptops

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. The Real Difference: KVM Dock vs. Standard Dock + KVM Switch**
- KVM dock (all-in-one): built-in switching, fewer cables, lower max specs, niche brand options
- Standard dock + separate KVM switch: full dock specs, more cables
- KVM docks often use proprietary USB-C power delivery that may not fully charge high-power laptops

**2. Not All Keyboards Work With KVM Hotkeys**
- KVM hotkeys require a keyboard following strict HID standard
- Gaming keyboards with custom firmware: hotkey may fail silently
- Fix: use a basic wired USB keyboard for hotkey switching

**3. Simultaneous Peripheral Connection Limits**
- Most KVM docks share only keyboard + mouse between the two laptops; USB storage and audio may or may not switch
- USB device disconnection during switch: some devices need to re-initialize (webcam, USB audio interface)

**4. Power Delivery Asymmetry**
- KVM docks often provide full PD to one host and reduced power to the idle host
- The idle laptop gets slow-charging while not active

**5. Mac + Windows Mixed Setup Complications**
- macOS does not auto-switch display settings when connecting/disconnecting KVM
- Display arrangement and input device settings are per-computer and may need reconfiguration after each switch

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- KVM dock vs. dock + separate KVM switch: trade-off comparison
- Gaming keyboard + KVM hotkey incompatibility warning
- Peripheral switch behavior table (what auto-switches vs. manual)
- Active vs. idle PD split disclosure
- Mac + Windows mixed setup notes

## Article 8: Best NAS for Photo and Video Storage

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Capacity Planning: Real Numbers for Creatives**
- 4K video at typical bitrates (100 Mbps H.264): 1 hour = ~45GB
- 4K RAW (Blackmagic, RED): 1 hour = 250-500GB
- A 20TB NAS in RAID 5 with 4 drives = ~60TB usable -- enough for roughly 1,300 hours of H.264 4K or 120-240 hours of RAW video

**2. Network Speed Is the Real Bottleneck for Video Editing**
- 1GbE NAS: ~125 MB/s max -- fine for 1 editor on H.264 4K; too slow for BRAW or ProRes
- 2.5GbE NAS: ~300 MB/s -- handles 2 editors on H.264 or 1 editor on ProRes 4K
- 10GbE NAS: ~1,000 MB/s -- required for multi-user RAW video editing workflows

**3. NVMe Cache: How It Actually Works**
- NVMe cache accelerates random reads/writes (metadata, small files, database lookups)
- It does NOT significantly speed up large sequential video file transfers
- Buyers often add NVMe cache expecting video editing speed improvement -- false expectation

**4. Color Science: NAS-Stored RAW Files Still Need Calibrated Monitor**
- NAS stores files; display quality comes from monitor + calibration, not NAS
- Native Thunderbolt display output + NAS via Ethernet = correct setup for creatives

**5. Codec Transcoding Requirements by NAS**
- H.264: most Intel Celeron NAS can hardware transcode
- H.265/HEVC: requires Intel QuickSync or better
- ProRes: no NAS hardware transcodes ProRes -- software only, very slow

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Capacity planning table (GB per hour by format)
- Editor count vs. network speed recommendation (1GbE/2.5GbE/10GbE)
- NVMe cache: what it actually speeds up (and what it doesn't) for video workflows
- Codec vs. NAS processor tier table

## Article 9: Best KVM Docking Stations for Two Computers

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. KVM Dock Thunderbolt Bandwidth Is Often Compromised**
- KVM docks must split one connection across switching logic, display outputs, and USB -- adds latency and reduces effective bandwidth vs. a dedicated dock
- KVM docks rarely use certified TB4 chipsets; most use USB-C with proprietary switching

**2. EDID Emulation Solves One Problem But Creates Another**
- EDID emulation maintains display settings when switching away from a computer
- Some monitors take 3-5 seconds to adapt after switching -- visible black screen or flicker

**3. Business Laptop + KVM Dock: IT Policy Conflicts**
- Enterprise-managed laptops (Intune, MDM) may restrict USB-C device approval
- A KVM dock detected as a new device on every switch may require repeated authorization

**4. Audio Switching Is Inconsistent**
- KVM docks may or may not switch the default audio output device when switching computers
- Windows may remain on internal speakers after KVM switch if the dock's USB audio isn't set as default

**5. When a Separate KVM Switch + Dock Is Better**
- For users who need full dock performance (100W PD, 4K 120Hz, 2.5GbE), a separate KVM switch + two individual docks is the better approach
- KVM docking station makes sense for price-conscious setups where spec compromises are acceptable

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- KVM dock bandwidth compromise vs. dedicated dock explanation
- Switching speed and display flicker disclosure
- Enterprise IT/MDM lock conflict warning
- Audio behavior after switch documentation
- KVM dock vs. separate KVM switch architecture guide

## Article 10: Best NAS for Plex Media Servers

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Direct Play vs. Transcoding: Most Buyers Don't Need to Transcode**
- Direct Play: client device plays original file format with no NAS processing -- NAS CPU irrelevant
- Most modern streaming clients support H.264/H.265 direct play
- Buyers paying premium for Intel NAS for 4K transcoding may not need to if all clients support direct play

**2. Plex Pass Is Required for Hardware Transcoding**
- Hardware transcoding in Plex requires a Plex Pass subscription
- Without Plex Pass, even a powerful Intel NAS will software-transcode -- same speed as a budget ARM NAS

**3. ARM-Based NAS for Pure Direct Play**
- An ARM-based budget NAS cannot hardware transcode but handles direct play perfectly for most setups
- If all clients support direct play, an ARM NAS saves significant money vs. Intel NAS

**4. Network Speed Limits 4K Streaming**
- 4K H.265 remux: 50-80 Mbps -- fine on 1GbE
- For multi-room simultaneous 4K streams: 2.5GbE NAS + 2.5GbE switch recommended

**5. Plex Libraries With Large Collections: RAM and SSD Cache Matter**
- A Plex library of 5,000+ items requires significant RAM for metadata indexing
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for large libraries + multi-user simultaneous streaming

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Direct Play vs. Transcoding: does the buyer actually need an Intel NAS?
- Plex Pass requirement for hardware transcoding disclosure
- ARM NAS recommendation for direct-play-only setups
- Simultaneous 4K stream capacity by network speed table
- Library size vs. RAM requirement table

## Article 11: Best Docking Stations for MacBook Air

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. The Chip Generation Determines Display Count**
- M1/M2 MacBook Air: 1 native external display
- M3 MacBook Air: 2 displays, but second display only works in clamshell mode (lid closed)
- M4 MacBook Air: 2 native displays with lid open or closed

**2. MacBook Air Charges at 30-45W -- Dock PD Still Matters for Peripherals**
- A dock with 100W PD can simultaneously charge MacBook Air + iPad + iPhone via downstream ports
- Choosing a dock based only on "enough to charge the MacBook Air" misses the peripheral charging consideration

**3. MacBook Air Overheating in Sustained Dock Use**
- MacBook Air has no fan -- thermal throttling occurs during sustained CPU/GPU loads
- Running dual 4K displays through DisplayLink + video conferencing simultaneously can trigger throttling

**4. Thunderbolt vs. USB-C Port on MacBook Air**
- A basic USB-C hub connected to a TB port works but doesn't use TB4 bandwidth
- A Thunderbolt dock uses full 40Gbps -- needed for dual 4K native

**5. MagSafe vs. Dock Charging**
- MacBook Air with MagSafe can charge via MagSafe while dock provides data/display via USB-C
- This frees both USB-C ports for other connections

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Chip generation display count table (M1 through M4, with clamshell vs. lid-open notes)
- MacBook Air thermal throttling warning in sustained dock use
- Why a higher-wattage dock still makes sense for a 45W laptop (peripheral charging)
- Thunderbolt dock vs. USB-C hub: not the same even on the same ports
- MagSafe + dock: optimal two-cable setup

## Article 12: Best 4-Bay NAS for Home Offices

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. RAID 5 vs. SHR vs. RAID 10: Clear Recommendation Never Given**
- RAID 5 (3+1 parity): 75% usable, 1 drive failure tolerated -- most common recommendation
- Hybrid RAID (mixed drive sizes, expand one drive at a time): better for gradual upgrades
- RAID 10 (mirroring + striping): 50% usable, fastest read/write -- best for Plex/heavy read workloads

**2. True Total Cost With Drives**
- 4-bay enclosure (~$600) + 4x 8TB drives (~$180 each) = $1,320+ total
- Compare: equivalent cloud storage cost over 9 years may be similar to the NAS cost -- for users who don't need local speed/privacy, cloud can be cheaper long-term

**3. RAID Rebuild Time After Drive Failure**
- 4-bay RAID 5 with 8TB drives: rebuild after 1 drive failure takes 12-48 hours
- During rebuild: NAS performance degrades significantly; another drive failure = total data loss

**4. Drive Upgrade Path**
- Hybrid RAID allows adding larger drives one at a time and gradually expanding capacity
- Standard RAID 5: requires all drives to be replaced if upgrading capacity tier

**5. Synology 2024+ Drive Compatibility Restrictions**
- Newer Plus models: third-party drives show compatibility warnings in DSM
- Brand-name NAS drives avoid warnings but carry a price premium

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- RAID 5 vs. SHR vs. RAID 10 recommendation matrix (by use case)
- True total cost table (enclosure + 4x drives at multiple capacities)
- Cloud vs. NAS TCO calculation (break-even point)
- RAID rebuild time and risk window explanation
- Drive compatibility restriction and cost premium

## Article 13: Best Docking Stations for Dell Laptops

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Dell Dock Model Decoder: No Guide Maps This Clearly**
- WD19: USB-C, 130W PD (Dell laptops), 90W (non-Dell) -- entry level
- WD19TB: Thunderbolt 3
- WD22TB4: Thunderbolt 4 modular, current TB4 dock
- Dell "SD25TB4 Pro" line: newer Thunderbolt 4 smart dock generation

**2. OEM Power Delivery Advantage**
- Dell docks deliver full rated wattage to Dell laptops via a proprietary power negotiation protocol, but only a lower standard wattage to non-Dell laptops via the same connection
- Non-Dell users buying a Dell-branded dock pay Dell premium pricing but get standard PD only

**3. Dell BIOS Thunderbolt Authorization -- First Boot Issue**
- New Dell laptops default to "user authorization" mode for Thunderbolt devices
- On first connection, dock may not be recognized until user approves it via Windows dialog or BIOS
- "Not recognized" = very likely a BIOS authorization issue, not a hardware defect

**4. Modular Dock Design: Upgrade Path Not Explained**
- Some Dell docks have a detachable host module marketed as upgradeable to newer standards
- Currently, no upgrade module may actually be available despite the "upgradeable" marketing claim

**5. Dell Portable Adapters Are NOT Docks -- Common Mislabeling**
- Dell's portable USB-C multiport adapters have no power delivery passthrough for the laptop
- Frequently appears in "best Dell docking station" search results but cannot charge the laptop while providing video output

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Dell dock model decoder table mapped to Dell laptop series
- OEM PD advantage disclosure
- BIOS Thunderbolt authorization step-by-step for first-time connection
- Modular dock upgrade module: current reality vs. marketing claim
- "Not a dock" callout for portable adapters

## Article 14: Best Docking Stations for 4K Monitors

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. 4K@30Hz vs. 4K@60Hz -- Critical Distinction Never Explained Upfront**
- HDMI 1.4: 4K@30Hz max -- common on cheap budget docks
- HDMI 2.0: 4K@60Hz -- required for fluid motion
- 4K@30Hz causes visible motion blur in video and mouse cursor movement

**2. The Dual 4K@60Hz Bandwidth Requirement**
- Dual 4K@60Hz needs ~30Gbps of display bandwidth
- Thunderbolt 4 at 40Gbps: dual 4K@60Hz leaves only ~10Gbps for data -- adequate but tight
- USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 at 10Gbps total: cannot drive dual 4K@60Hz

**3. HDMI Version on Monitor Side Matters Too**
- A dock's output and the monitor's input must both support the target spec -- the weaker of the two wins

**4. HDR and 10-bit Color Depth Requirements**
- 4K HDR10 requires HDMI 2.0b or DisplayPort 1.4 minimum
- Some docks have HDMI 2.0 (not 2.0b) -- cannot pass HDR10 signal correctly

**5. 4K Resolution on macOS: Scaling Behavior**
- macOS default scaling at 4K uses 2x HiDPI scaling -- requires more GPU
- DisplayLink 4K on Mac cannot use macOS's native HiDPI scaling properly -- may look "slightly fuzzy" vs. native

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- 4K@30Hz vs. 4K@60Hz difference with visual motion description
- Dual 4K@60Hz bandwidth requirement (USB-C 3.2 cannot do it; TB4 can)
- "Weakest link" principle for HDMI version chains
- HDR format vs. HDMI/DP version compatibility table
- macOS HiDPI vs. DisplayLink sharpness difference

## Article 15: Best NAS for Small Businesses

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Network Bottleneck for Multi-User Teams**
- 1GbE NAS + gigabit switch: 5 users simultaneously transferring at full speed = modest per-user throughput, adequate for documents, too slow for video/large files
- 2.5GbE or 10GbE NAS multiplies throughput for concurrent users -- requires a matching switch

**2. Active Directory Integration -- Critical for Business Use**
- Most small businesses migrate from individual NAS accounts to centralized directory sync as they scale past 5 users
- Setting up this integration is complex enough to need IT help

**3. Backup of the NAS Itself**
- Most guides address NAS as a backup destination -- not as a device that itself needs backing up
- Ransomware attacks on NAS are increasing; cloud backup integration for the NAS itself is critical

**4. UPS Integration**
- Power outages can corrupt NAS RAID arrays mid-write
- A USB-connected UPS lets the NAS safely shut down when triggered -- a required companion purchase for business use

**5. Warranty and Support for Business vs. Home NAS**
- Value-tier NAS models: shorter warranty, no enterprise support option
- Plus/Pro-tier models: longer warranty, enterprise support add-on available

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Concurrent user throughput table (user count vs. needed NAS network speed)
- Active Directory integration note (and when IT support is needed)
- Cloud backup of the NAS itself -- ransomware risk
- UPS companion recommendation with specific model and cost
- Warranty tier comparison for business purchasing decision

## Article 16: Best Docking Stations for Small Desks

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Footprint Dimensions Never Compared in Tables**
- A "compact" dock can range from small USB hub size to full dock size
- For desks under 100cm wide: an oversized dock is disproportionate

**2. Cable Length Limitations Create Placement Problems**
- Attached-cable compact docks often have 20-30cm cables -- dock must sit directly next to laptop
- Separate-cable versions require a certified cable, adding cost

**3. Port Accessibility: Top vs. Side vs. Front Placement**
- Compact vertical docks: ports on top and sides -- frequent-use ports hard to reach when dock is beside a monitor
- Horizontal slim docks: ports on front/back -- easier access but larger footprint

**4. Bus-Powered vs. AC-Powered Compact Docks**
- Bus-powered: limited power budget for connected devices; no laptop charging passthrough
- AC-powered compact docks: can charge laptop + run peripherals; larger due to power brick -- often defeats the "compact" purpose

**5. Thermal Concerns for Compact Docks**
- Compact docks with passive cooling can get very warm during sustained use
- Placing a compact dock under papers or in a tight cable channel restricts airflow -- can cause throttling or USB dropout

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Dock dimensions table (L x W x H) for comparison
- Cable length vs. desk layout compatibility guidance
- Port placement (top/side/front) for frequent-access ergonomics
- Total footprint including power brick
- Thermal placement guidelines for compact/passive docks

## Article 17: Best Diskless NAS Enclosures

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. SMR vs. CMR: The Most Important Drive Selection Factor**
- SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording): cheaper, slower write performance, NOT suitable for NAS RAID
- CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording): designed for continuous write, suitable for RAID
- Some "NAS" branded drives at lower capacities actually use SMR -- causes RAID rebuild failures

**2. Drive Compatibility List: Check Before Buying**
- Each NAS manufacturer publishes a hardware compatibility list
- Buying an unlisted drive: may work but RAID rebuild may fail, health reporting may not work correctly

**3. Enclosure vs. Complete NAS: When Does Diskless Make Sense**
- Diskless: buy when you have drives already, or want drive flexibility
- Complete NAS with drives included: simpler, less drive selection anxiety -- lower-risk for first-time buyers

**4. Case Fan and Drive Temperature**
- Cheap enclosures have slower or weaker fans -- drive temperatures in a 4-bay can exceed safe long-term thresholds without airflow
- Premium enclosures have better fan curves and temperature monitoring in their OS

**5. Diskless Means No OS Pre-Installation**
- When buying diskless, the NAS OS must be installed during first setup (requires internet, downloads automatically for most brands)
- New buyers often assume the OS is already installed -- it is not

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- SMR vs. CMR drive selection guide (with how to verify before buying)
- Drive compatibility list check instruction per brand
- Diskless vs. included-drives: beginner vs. advanced buyer decision guide
- Drive temperature management for 4-bay enclosures
- First-boot OS installation process per NAS brand

## Article 18: Best Docking Stations with 100W Power Delivery

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Rated 100W vs. Actual Delivery: The Overhead Gap**
- Dock hardware uses 10-15W from its own power budget to run internal chipsets, USB controllers, and display output
- A dock "rated 100W PD" delivers approximately 82-90W to the laptop

**2. 100W Is Only Enough for Mid-Range Laptops**
- MacBook Air: needs 45W -- 100W dock is more than adequate
- MacBook Pro 16": needs 140W stock adapter -- 100W dock will charge slowly under sustained load
- Gaming laptops: need 180-230W -- 100W dock charges at a fraction of capacity; laptop may drain under gaming load even while docked

**3. USB PD 3.1 Extended Power Range (EPR): What 100W Doesn't Include**
- Standard USB PD: max 100W
- USB PD 3.1 EPR: up to 240W -- required for gaming laptops and mobile workstations
- Only specialty docks support EPR -- mainstream "100W" docks do not

**4. Downstream USB Charging Budget**
- A "100W PD" dock splits its power: most to laptop + remaining budget for USB-A and USB-C downstream ports
- High-demand peripheral charging setups can cause the laptop to charge very slowly

**5. Power Brick Wattage Must Match Dock's PD Rating**
- Replacing the dock's power brick with a smaller third-party GaN charger reduces the PD delivered to the laptop significantly

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Rated 100W vs. actual effective wattage table
- Laptop wattage requirement table (MacBook Air through gaming laptop)
- USB PD 3.1 EPR explanation for 140W+ laptop buyers
- Downstream device charging impact on laptop PD
- Power brick wattage warning (don't replace with smaller GaN charger)

## Article 19: Best NAS Hard Drives for Home Office Storage

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. SMR vs. CMR: The Most Dangerous Buying Mistake**
- SMR drives write new data by overlapping existing tracks -- slow during RAID rebuild, can cause array failure
- CMR drives write to dedicated tracks -- stable for RAID
- Lower-capacity "NAS" drives from some lines use SMR; Pro-tier lines and IronWolf are CMR

**2. Workload Rating: What TB/Year Means Practically**
- Standard NAS drives: ~180TB/year workload rating
- Pro-tier NAS drives: ~300TB/year
- Desktop drives: ~55TB/year
- A typical home office NAS with 2 users doing daily backups uses well under the standard rating

**3. Drive Failure Rates by Brand/Model Over Time**
- Independent large-scale reliability reports (e.g. from cloud storage operators) are a more authoritative source than manufacturer claims
- Most NAS drive articles rely only on manufacturer reliability claims

**4. Vibration Compensation in Multi-Bay Setups**
- 4-bay and larger NAS: multiple spinning drives cause sympathetic vibration
- NAS-grade drives include vibration compensation firmware; desktop drives do not -- can cause read errors in 4-bay+ environments

**5. When to Use SSD Instead of HDD**
- HDD: best for large-capacity, cost-effective, non-speed-critical storage
- SSD: best for VM hosting, database applications, or when drive noise/vibration is unacceptable
- NVMe SSD as cache + HDD as storage: best of both worlds for most home office use cases

### WorkCocoon Differentiators

## Article 20: Best Docking Stations for 4K 120Hz Monitors

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Thunderbolt 4 Cannot Natively Drive 4K@120Hz Without DSC**
- TB4 at 40Gbps: not enough bandwidth for uncompressed 4K@120Hz
- Solution: Display Stream Compression (DSC) -- visually lossless compression to fit within TB4 bandwidth
- DSC requires support on both dock and monitor -- not all 4K@120Hz monitors support DSC input

**2. Only TB5 Can Do 4K@120Hz Uncompressed**
- Thunderbolt 5: enough bandwidth for uncompressed 4K@120Hz
- TB5 laptop availability is still limited; TB5 docks are more expensive

**3. Display Cable Must Support 4K@120Hz**
- An older HDMI cable cannot carry a 4K@120Hz signal -- locks the monitor at 4K@60Hz even if dock and monitor support 120Hz
- Required: a certified high-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort cable

**4. 4K@120Hz vs. 1440p@144Hz: The Productivity vs. Performance Trade-Off**
- 4K@120Hz requires more GPU/bandwidth than 1440p@144Hz
- For home office (not gaming): 4K@60Hz is visually superior to 1440p@144Hz for static work
- For gaming on mid-range GPUs: 1440p@144Hz may provide smoother gameplay

**5. MacBook Does Not Support 4K@120Hz via DisplayLink**
- DisplayLink compression limits max output to 4K@60Hz on macOS
- Mac users wanting 4K@120Hz must use native Thunderbolt output (higher-tier Pro/Max chips only)

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- TB4 vs. TB5 for 4K@120Hz: compressed vs. uncompressed explanation
- DSC monitor compatibility requirement
- Required cable version for 4K@120Hz
- 4K@120Hz vs. 1440p@144Hz decision guide by use case
- Mac chip display limit at 4K: refresh rate ceiling per chip

## Article 21: Best SSD NAS for Fast File Access

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. NVMe Cache vs. All-SSD Main Storage: Completely Different Use Cases**
- NVMe cache: accelerates random read/write -- helps database, VM, small file access; does NOT significantly speed up large sequential file transfers
- All-SSD in main bays: true high-speed primary storage for all workload types including sequential

**2. SSD Endurance in 24/7 NAS: TBW Ratings Matter**
- Consumer SATA SSDs: designed for PC use, limited total-bytes-written rating
- NAS-specific SSDs: 24/7 optimized, higher endurance ratings
- Using consumer SSDs in a NAS is common but accelerates wear

**3. Cost Per TB: SSD vs. HDD vs. Hybrid (Realistic Math)**
- HDD remains far cheaper per TB than SATA SSD or NVMe
- At what point does the speed premium of SSD justify the cost depends heavily on the actual workload

**4. Heat and Longevity: SSD NAS Stays Cooler**
- HDDs generate heat from spinning platters and motors; SSDs generate minimal heat and have no vibration
- For fanless or near-silent NAS enclosures placed in tight spaces, SSDs allow passive cooling that HDDs cannot

**5. When All-SSD NAS Is Actually Worth It**
- Worth it: VM hosting, database servers, NAS as Plex metadata store, small office with many simultaneous users
- Not worth it: home media streaming, backup destination, large capacity photo archive -- an HDD NAS with NVMe cache achieves most of the speed benefit at a fraction of the cost

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- NVMe cache vs. all-SSD main bays: what each actually speeds up
- SSD endurance in 24/7 NAS context (consumer vs. NAS-grade SSDs)
- Cost per TB comparison table with break-even analysis
- SSD NAS thermal advantage in restricted placements
- "Is all-SSD worth it?" decision guide by use case

## Article 22: Best Portable Docking Stations for Remote Work

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Bus-Powered vs. AC-Powered: The Capability Gap for Remote Work**
- Bus-powered (no power brick): draws power from laptop -- can power connected devices but cannot charge laptop simultaneously
- AC-powered portable dock: charges laptop + powers displays -- heavier but far more functional for all-day remote work

**2. Hotel HDTV Connectivity**
- Hotel TVs usually have older HDMI versions with HDCP content restrictions
- A dock connecting to a hotel TV often works for desktop display but streaming apps may be blocked by HDCP

**3. Airport Security and USB Devices**
- Compact docks with power bricks: power brick must go in a separate bin at security
- Bus-powered hubs (no brick): usually clear security without issues

**4. Cafe Power Outlet Reality: Bus-Powered or Bust**
- AC-powered portable dock requires an outlet -- not always available at a cafe or co-working space
- Bus-powered dock use causes measurable additional battery drain per hour

**5. Video Call Quality From Portable Dock**
- A USB-A port on a portable dock is often USB 2.0 -- sufficient for 1080p webcam but not enough for full-resolution 4K webcam
- Port labeling on cheap portable docks can be misleading about actual speed

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Bus-powered vs. AC-powered: use case matrix for remote workers
- Hotel TV HDMI compatibility + HDCP limitation note
- Travel security tip (bus-powered hub vs. AC dock)
- Battery drain from bus-powered hub disclosure
- USB port speed verification for 4K webcam compatibility

## Article 23: Best Quiet NAS for Home Offices

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. dB Is Measured at Idle -- Real-World Numbers Are Higher**
- Manufacturer dB ratings are measured at idle with no drive activity
- Under write load (backup running, RAID rebuild): fan speed increases; drives ramp up -- real noise is higher than the spec sheet number

**2. Drive Noise Contributes More Than Fan Noise**
- Modern NAS fans are quite quiet; spinning HDDs in operation are often louder than the fan itself
- SSD-based NAS is essentially silent -- SSD operation adds near-zero noise

**3. Vibration Through Desk/Floor Amplifies Perceived Noise**
- A NAS on a hollow wooden desk sounds louder than the same NAS on a solid surface
- Anti-vibration pads (rubber feet, foam mount) reduce perceived noise meaningfully at the listening point

**4. Nighttime vs. Daytime Noise Thresholds**
- A NAS placed near a bedroom or quiet office is far more noticeable at night than the same unit in a living room with ambient noise

**5. Fanless NAS Options**
- Some NAS models support fanless operation with low-power CPUs (for low-bay count, low workload) -- completely silent
- Trade-off: higher cost per TB, limited max capacity

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Idle vs. load dB measurements
- Drive noise contribution vs. fan noise breakdown
- Anti-vibration pad recommendation as noise reduction technique
- Nighttime vs. daytime acceptable dB thresholds by placement
- Fanless NAS options for maximum quiet

## Article 24: Best Docking Stations with 2.5Gb Ethernet

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. You Need a 2.5GbE Switch or Router to Benefit -- Never Mentioned**
- A 2.5GbE dock connected to a 1GbE router is capped at 1Gbps (weakest link in the chain)
- Most home routers have 1GbE LAN ports only -- a 2.5GbE switch or router upgrade is required to see any benefit

**2. 2.5GbE Benefits Are Real Only for LAN-to-LAN Transfers**
- Most home internet connections are the actual bottleneck, not the dock
- 2.5GbE benefit scenario: transferring large files between laptop (via dock) and a 2.5GbE NAS on the same network

**3. Wake-on-LAN Behavior Varies by Dock**
- Some 2.5GbE docks support Wake-on-LAN only while powered; behavior varies by model
- IT users relying on WoL for remote laptop management should verify dock-specific support

**4. 2.5GbE NIC Compatibility With Corporate VPN**
- Some corporate VPN clients conflict with third-party 2.5GbE NICs used in docks
- On managed corporate devices, driver installation may require IT approval

**5. USB4/Thunderbolt Dock 2.5GbE vs. Bandwidth**
- The 2.5GbE chip draws from a separate PCIe lane, not from display bandwidth
- Adding 2.5GbE to a dock does NOT reduce display performance -- a common misconception

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- 2.5GbE switch requirement explanation (dock alone is not enough)
- When 2.5GbE actually helps vs. when it makes no difference
- Wake-on-LAN support documentation per recommended dock
- Corporate VPN + third-party NIC driver conflict warning
- Clarification that 2.5GbE does not reduce display bandwidth

## Article 25: Best Budget NAS for Beginners

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. The Hidden Cost Shock: Drives Cost More Than the NAS**
- A budget diskless enclosure plus 2 NAS-grade drives often costs 2x the enclosure price alone
- A cost table showing total investment at different capacity tiers would prevent sticker shock

**2. Drive Compatibility Restrictions for Budget Buyers**
- Value-series NAS models: less restrictive drive compatibility
- One step up to Plus-series models: may show compatibility warnings for third-party drives that look scary but are often mostly cosmetic

**3. All-in-One Cloud NAS vs. Traditional Diskless: The True Beginner Comparison**
- A single-drive, cloud-first NAS with drive included: simple setup, no RAID, no expandability -- best for a truly non-technical buyer who just wants automatic backup
- A traditional diskless NAS: more setup complexity but expandability, RAID, and multi-app support -- better for a buyer who wants to grow into more use cases

**4. App Installation Complexity Is Not Beginner-Friendly**
- The app ecosystem looks simple but configuring transcoding apps or backup software requires understanding ports, permissions, and firewall rules
- Honest estimate: first complete NAS setup for a non-technical user is several hours, not "set it and forget it"

**5. What You Actually Need NAS For vs. Simpler Alternatives**
- Just want to back up one computer? An external USB drive may be simpler and cheaper
- Want to access files from multiple devices? A simple cloud-connected single-drive NAS may be enough
- Want a media server with a large library? A traditional NAS is worth it

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Total cost table (enclosure + drives at multiple capacity tiers)
- Cloud-first vs. traditional diskless NAS direct comparison
- Drive compatibility: which tier has restrictions
- Honest setup time estimate for first-time NAS users
- "Do you actually need a NAS?" use-case decision tree

## Article 26: Best Docking Stations with SD Card Readers

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. UHS-I vs. UHS-II Card Reader Speed: The Critical Distinction**
- UHS-I SD card reader: typical 80-90 MB/s real-world
- UHS-II SD card reader: typical 200-280 MB/s real-world
- Most dock built-in readers are UHS-I only -- a bottleneck for cameras that shoot UHS-II cards

**2. The USB 3.0 Bandwidth Ceiling for SD Card Readers**
- Most dock SD readers connect internally via USB 3.0 even if the dock has Thunderbolt upstream
- When transferring via SD reader while another USB device is active, bandwidth is shared -- effective SD speed may drop

**3. CFexpress and CFast Support**
- Professional cameras using CFexpress or CFast cards: no mainstream laptop dock includes this reader type -- requires a separate dedicated reader

**4. SD Card Reader vs. Dedicated Card Reader**
- Dock's built-in SD reader: convenient but typically UHS-I speed
- A dedicated dual-slot UHS-II reader connected to the dock's fast USB port outperforms the dock's built-in reader

**5. SD Card Reader Compatibility With Modern Card Formats**
- Newer high-capacity and high-speed-rated cards require UHS-II reader support to maintain rated speed -- not all dock SD readers support these formats

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- UHS-I vs. UHS-II dock SD card reader comparison with transfer time example
- Bandwidth impact on SD speed during multi-device use
- CFexpress support gap (docks don't have it; dedicated reader required)
- Dock SD reader vs. dedicated UHS-II reader: when to use which
- Card format compatibility per recommended dock

## Article 27: Best Vertical Docking Stations for Clean Desk Setups

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. MacBook in Clamshell Mode: Thermal Risk Is Real**
- A MacBook in a vertical dock (clamshell) during heavy tasks draws air through the underside -- can be blocked by dock contact points
- Heavy sustained tasks in clamshell mode can trigger thermal throttling within 20-30 minutes
- Fix: use a vertical stand that holds the laptop with an air gap at the bottom, not flush contact

**2. Port Accessibility in Vertical Orientation**
- Vertical docks place ports on top or sides -- plugging in USB drives or headphones requires reaching up/over
- Solution: add a short USB-C extension cable to bring a port to desk level

**3. Stability at Different Desk Heights and Weight**
- Heavier laptops in a vertical dock with insufficient weight rating can tip under vibration
- Look for weighted bases or cable-management clip attachment points for heavy laptops

**4. Cable Routing for Clean Desk Requires Planning**
- A vertical dock setup looks clean in photos but requires careful cable routing to maintain the aesthetic
- Power cable from dock PSU to wall is often the ugliest remaining cable -- a cable channel helps

**5. Display Output in Clamshell Mode on Mac**
- Some Mac chip generations only enable a second external display specifically in clamshell mode -- a vertical dock enables this setup naturally without a separate lid-closing step

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- MacBook clamshell thermal risk + vent clearance guidance
- Port accessibility trade-off disclosure for vertical placement
- Weight rating and stability guidance for heavy laptops
- Cable routing guide for the "clean desk" vertical setup
- Clamshell dual-display use case via vertical dock

## Article 28: Best Budget Docking Stations Under $100

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Budget Dock Chipset Quality Affects Reliability**
- Premium docks use certified controllers; budget docks under $100 use cheaper uncertified chips
- Cheaper internal chips are more likely to have USB disconnect issues under heavy load, display flicker, or heat throttling

**2. The 4K@30Hz vs. 4K@60Hz at Budget Price Point**
- Many budget docks advertise "4K support" but deliver 4K@30Hz over HDMI
- Fix: use DisplayPort output if available on the budget dock, or use budget dock only for 1080p/1440p

**3. Hidden Cable Cost**
- Budget docks that don't include a cable require a compatible cable purchased separately, adding real cost to the "budget" price
- Some budget docks ship with a cable so short it only works if the dock sits directly next to the laptop

**4. Heat Is a Budget Dock Problem**
- Budget docks with passive cooling run hot during sustained use
- Symptom: devices disconnect randomly after 30-60 minutes of use = the dock is overheating

**5. Bus-Powered vs. Self-Powered Budget Docks**
- Many "docking stations" under $100 are actually bus-powered hubs that draw all power from the laptop
- The "dock" labeling at budget tier is misleading -- a true dock has its own power supply

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Budget chipset quality as reliability predictor
- 4K@30Hz vs. 4K@60Hz: specifying which each budget pick achieves
- True effective cost (dock + cable if not included)
- Heat as primary failure mode at budget tier (symptom + fix)
- Hub vs. dock distinction (bus-powered vs. self-powered)

## Article 29: Best Docking Stations for Chromebooks

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Chrome OS USB-C Display Output Limitations**
- Most Chromebooks support 1 external display at 4K@60Hz via USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode
- Dual display on Chromebook requires a DisplayLink dock + the DisplayLink for ChromeOS driver
- Budget Chromebooks without DisplayPort Alt Mode cannot drive any external display via USB-C

**2. Thunderbolt Chromebooks: A Growing Category**
- A small number of premium Chromebooks now ship with Thunderbolt 4 -- can use full TB4 docks
- Standard Chromebooks: USB-C with Alt Mode only -- a TB4 dock will work but only at USB-C Alt Mode speeds

**3. Android App Display Behavior**
- Chromebooks in tablet/tent mode with external display: Android apps may not resize correctly for the external monitor

**4. Chromebook Power Delivery Limits**
- Most Chromebooks charge at 45-65W maximum -- a 100W PD dock is overkill but not harmful

**5. Google Meet / Video Call Quality From a Dock**
- Chrome OS handles USB bandwidth allocation for webcams differently from Windows
- A DisplayLink dock on Chrome OS requires the DisplayLink for ChromeOS extension from the Chrome Web Store

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Chromebook display output capability check (Alt Mode vs. TB vs. none) by model
- Thunderbolt Chromebook vs. standard USB-C Chromebook recommendation split
- Android app display behavior warning for Chromebook dock setups
- Chromebook PD requirement (45-65W is enough; 100W is overkill)
- DisplayLink for ChromeOS driver installation guide

## Article 30: Best Docking Stations for Gaming Laptops

### Content Gaps (What Competitors Miss)

**1. Docking Stations Cannot Supply Enough Power for Most Gaming Laptops**
- Gaming laptop stock chargers are often 130-230W; most docks max at 100W PD
- Reality: gaming laptop connected to a 100W PD dock will charge but battery will drain during heavy gaming
- Practical recommendation: dock for productivity at desk, plug in original charger for gaming sessions

**2. eGPU via Dock Is Not Possible (and Often Misunderstood)**
- An eGPU connects DIRECTLY to the laptop's Thunderbolt port -- not through a dock
- A dock occupies the laptop's TB port; correct setup is eGPU direct to one TB port, dock to a second TB port if available

**3. Gaming Laptop Display Output: GPU Routing Matters**
- Laptops with advanced GPU-switching support can route display output directly from the discrete GPU through USB-C/TB, bypassing the integrated graphics bottleneck
- Older gaming laptops without this feature: external display through a dock is limited by integrated graphics bandwidth

**4. USB Bandwidth Under Gaming Load**
- A gaming laptop under load generates significant PCIe traffic that competes with Thunderbolt bandwidth
- Symptom: headset, controller, or USB audio disconnects mid-game when docked
- Fix: plug game-critical peripherals directly into laptop USB-A ports; use dock for non-latency-critical devices

**5. Dock as Productivity Setup, Not Gaming Setup**
- For gaming: direct display connection + original charger + direct USB peripherals = best performance
- For work at desk: dock provides cable convenience for non-gaming workflow
- Best practice: switch from "dock mode" to "direct gaming mode" when gaming

### WorkCocoon Differentiators
- Gaming laptop power delivery reality table (required wattage vs. dock max PD)
- eGPU + dock incompatibility explanation
- GPU-switching impact on docked gaming display performance
- In-game USB dropout risk and fix
- "Dock for work, direct for gaming" workflow recommendation

## Cluster Summary: Top 3 Differentiators Across All 30 Articles

| Differentiator | Applies To | Why It Wins |
|---|---|---|
| True Total Cost Tables | Articles 2, 4, 12, 19, 25, 28 | Enclosure + drives + switch = real investment buyers need to plan |
| Device Generation/Chip Compatibility Tables | Articles 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 20, 29 | Prevents the #1 wrong-purchase decision in every dock article |
| "Will Work vs. Should Work" Guarantees | Articles 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 18, 24, 28 | TB4 certified vs. USB4/DisplayLink: reliability framing competitors avoid |

### Top 3 Universal Gaps Across This 30-Article Cluster

1. **Power delivery math -- always missing**: Every dock article lists "100W PD" but never discloses that overhead reduces this to 82-90W at the laptop. A simple 3-column table (dock rated PD / actual to laptop / laptop requirement) differentiates WorkCocoon in every dock article.
2. **Compatibility-by-generation tables**: Every buyer has a specific device, and every competitor gives generic advice. A table mapping device generation to dock recommendation is the single most actionable differentiator WorkCocoon can publish.
3. **NAS true cost and "do you actually need it?" decision guide**: An honest cost table (enclosure + drives at multiple capacity tiers) combined with a "cloud vs. NAS break-even" calculation and a "when NOT to buy" section builds trust no competitor provides.
