  { key: "grbl-vs-proprietary-control", q: "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?", a: "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow." },
  { key: "cnc-accuracy-vs-resolution", q: "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?", a: "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone." },
  { key: "desktop-cnc-metal-capability", q: "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?", a: "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine." },
  { key: "cnc-dust-collection-necessity", q: "Do I need a separate dust collection system for a desktop CNC?", a: "For anything beyond occasional light engraving, yes. Wood and MDF dust in particular accumulates quickly and can affect both air quality and machine longevity, so a shop vac or dedicated dust collector connected to the machine's dust port is a practical addition, not a luxury." },
  { key: "cnc-4th-axis-worth-it", q: "Is a 4th axis rotary attachment worth adding to a 3-axis CNC?", a: "It depends on your projects. A 4th axis genuinely opens up cylindrical and double-sided machining that a 3-axis setup can't do in one operation, but it also adds real cost, CAM complexity, and reduces the machine's usable XYZ envelope while installed." },
  { key: "cnc-workholding-basics", q: "What workholding do I actually need beyond the stock clamps?", a: "Stock clamps handle basic flat stock, but T-track spoilboards, dedicated vises, or double-sided tape become necessary as projects get more varied, since inconsistent workholding is one of the most common causes of a ruined cut on desktop CNC machines." },

True 5-axis machines control all five axes simultaneously for complex contoured surfaces, while a rotary add-on on a 3-axis base typically only indexes between fixed positions rather than moving simultaneously." },
        { q: "Do I need special CAM software for 5-axis machining?", a: "Generally yes. Standard 3-axis CAM software doesn't generate true 5-axis toolpaths, so confirm your CAM package explicitly supports simultaneous 5-axis output before buying a 5-axis machine." },
      ];
    case "laser":
      return [
        { q: `Is the wattage listed for a ${K} the actual cutting power?`, a: "Not always. Some listings state electrical input power rather than optical output power, which can overstate real cutting capability. Look for documented cut-depth figures in specific materials as a more reliable indicator." },
        { q: "Do I need eye protection even with an enclosed laser engraver?", a: "Yes, generally recommended regardless of enclosure, since opening the lid or a seal failure during operation can expose eyes to laser light. Check the specific safety class rating for the exact protection level documented." },
      ];
    case "steel":
    case "metal":
    case "aluminum":
      return [
        { q: `Can a desktop CNC really cut ${K.includes("steel") ? "steel" : "aluminum"} or just engrave the surface?`, a: "It depends entirely on rigidity and spindle torque. Many desktop machines can lightly engrave metal surfaces, but genuine cutting with real depth of cut needs a rigid frame, adequate torque, and appropriate feeds, verify with documented cut evidence rather than a material badge." },
        { q: "What's the biggest mistake people make cutting metal on a hobby CNC?", a: "Pushing feeds and depth of cut too aggressively for the machine's actual rigidity, which causes chatter, tool breakage, or lost steps. Start conservative and increase gradually based on how the machine and material respond." },
      ];
    case "wood":
    case "router":
      return [
        { q: `Do I need a separate dust collector for ${K}?`, a: "For anything beyond occasional light work, yes. Wood dust accumulates quickly and can affect both air quality and the machine's linear rails and screws over time if left unmanaged." },
        { q: "Does a bigger work area always mean a better router?", a: "Not necessarily. A larger work area often trades off rigidity unless the frame and rails are specifically reinforced for it, so check documented backlash or deflection figures rather than judging by size alone." },
      ];
    case "mill":
      return [
        { q: `What's the difference between ${K} and a CNC router for metal work?`, a: "Mills are generally built with more rigid frames, better spindle/toolholder systems, and tighter Z-axis control specifically for milling metal, while routers prioritize larger work area for wood and softer materials." },
        { q: "How much does Z-axis clearance actually matter?", a: "More than most buyers expect, since a vise or fixture takes up real Z-height, and a mill with a nominally tall Z-axis can still leave very little practical clearance once workholding is installed." },
      ];
    case "toolchanger":
      return [
        { q: `Does ${K} save real time over manually swapping bits?`, a: "Yes, meaningfully, for multi-tool jobs, since automatic tool changes typically take seconds versus the minutes needed to manually swap and re-zero a tool by hand." },
        { q: "Are automatic tool changers reliable long-term?", a: "Generally yes on well-documented systems, but verify the toolholder ecosystem cost and check for evidence of reliable performance over many cycles, not just a single demo change." },
      ];
    case "waterjet":
      return [
        { q: `How much does abrasive cost add to running ${K}?`, a: "It varies by job size and material, but abrasive is a genuine ongoing consumable cost that routers and mills don't have, budget for it specifically rather than treating the machine price as the full cost." },
        { q: "Can a desktop waterjet cut any material?", a: "Waterjets handle an unusually wide range of materials including metal, stone, and glass that routers can't touch, but always check manufacturer cut data for your specific material and thickness rather than assuming universal capability." },
      ];
    case "entry":
      return [
        { q: `Is ${K} actually beginner-friendly, or just marketed that way?`, a: "Check for specific evidence: real assembly time, accessible safety controls, and a genuinely guided software workflow, not just the word 'beginner' in the listing title." },
        { q: "What should a first-time CNC buyer budget beyond the machine price?", a: "Plan for basic workholding, extra cutting bits, and possibly CAM software, since many entry machines ship with only the minimum needed to run a first test cut." },
      ];
    case "mini":
      return [
        { q: `How much smaller is the usable work area on ${K} versus the external footprint?`, a: "Meaningfully smaller in most cases, since clamps, tool stick-out, and frame hardware all eat into the nominal travel figures, so check documented usable travel rather than exterior dimensions alone." },
        { q: "Are mini CNC machines noisier in a small room?", a: "Sound can feel more concentrated in a small room even at the same decibel level, so consider extraction and placement specifically for the room size, not just the machine's rated noise level." },
      ];
    case "sizeclass":
      return [
        { q: `Do all ${K} machines have the same specs since they share the size-class name?`, a: "No. The size-class number describes a rough XY footprint, not a technical standard, so rails, spindle, and controller can differ significantly between models sharing the same class name." },
        { q: "Should I buy based on the size class or the exact model number?", a: "Always verify the exact model and generation, since manufacturers frequently update hardware while keeping a similar size-class name, meaning two '3018' machines can perform very differently." },
      ];
    case "pcb":
      return [
        { q: `Can any ${K} mill PCB traces, or does it need special features?`, a: "Genuinely fine PCB work benefits from low spindle runout and surface probing specifically, since copper isolation depth is small enough that ordinary machine tolerances can produce broken or incomplete traces." },
        { q: "Is PCB milling faster than etching?", a: "It can be for prototyping since it skips chemicals entirely, but it requires more precise machine setup (runout, leveling) than etching does, so the tradeoff is speed for setup precision." },
      ];
    case "jewelry":
      return [
        { q: `Is a general-purpose CNC router good enough for ${K}, or do I need a dedicated machine?`, a: "It depends on runout and workholding precision. A general router with sufficiently low runout and precision fixtures can handle jewelry-scale work, but check those two figures specifically rather than assuming a general router is automatically capable." },
        { q: "What tooling do I need for jewelry-scale CNC work?", a: "Very small diameter cutters and material-specific feeds for wax, brass, or precious metal, which differ meaningfully from the tooling used for general wood or plastic routing." },
      ];
    case "enclosed":
      return [
        { q: `Does an enclosure on ${K} actually reduce noise, or just look contained?`, a: "A genuine factory-integrated enclosure with proper seals does measurably reduce noise and contain chips, but a thin acrylic shell without extraction mainly traps dust rather than solving noise or air quality." },
        { q: "Can I still access the workholding easily on an enclosed machine?", a: "This varies by design. Check that the enclosure allows reasonable door or panel access for setup and maintenance, since some enclosed designs trade convenience for containment." },
      ];
    case "budget":
      return [
        { q: `Are budget ${K} genuinely capable, or do they cut corners that matter?`, a: "It varies. Some budget machines use thinner rails or simpler controllers to hit a lower price, while others simply skip extra accessories while keeping comparable core hardware, compare documented specs rather than price alone." },
        { q: "What should I check before buying the cheapest option available?", a: "Verify what's actually included (spindle, controller, clamps), look for any dimensional test-cut evidence, and check warranty and replacement-part support, since these often separate genuinely comparable budget options from ones that cut real corners." },
      ];
    case "lathe":
      return [
        { q: `Can I convert a manual lathe into a CNC lathe like ${K}?`, a: "It's possible with the right conversion kit, but factory CNC lathes are generally more reliable and better documented than DIY conversions, verify which type you're actually buying before comparing specs." },
        { q: "Do all CNC lathes support threading?", a: "No. Threading requires spindle feedback and control architecture specifically built for it, so check that the exact model documents threading support rather than assuming any CNC lathe can cut threads." },
      ];
    default:
      return [
        { q: `What's the biggest mistake buyers make shopping for ${K}?`, a: "Judging capability by spindle wattage or work area alone. Rigidity, spindle torque, and documented cut evidence matter more for real-world performance than either headline spec." },
        { q: `Should I prioritize price or capability when choosing ${K}?`, a: "Capability first, since a machine that can't handle your intended materials or projects won't become more useful for being cheaper. Narrow the field by real capability, then compare price among the finalists." },
