Match the choice to your existing cabling and device NICs." },
  { key: "switch-oversubscription-meaning", q: "What does switching capacity or non-blocking throughput actually mean?", a: "It's the total bandwidth the switch's internal fabric can move simultaneously across all ports. A switch is 'non-blocking' if that capacity covers every port running at full speed at once; an oversubscribed switch can bottleneck under heavy simultaneous multi-port load even if each individual port is rated for 10G." },
  { key: "poe-budget-per-port", q: "Does a switch's total PoE budget mean every port can deliver its max wattage?", a: "No. The total PoE budget is shared across all active PoE ports, so if you power several high-draw devices simultaneously, the switch may not be able to deliver every port's maximum rated wattage at the same time. Check the total budget against your actual device count and power needs." },
  { key: "managed-vs-unmanaged-switch", q: "Do I actually need a managed switch, or is unmanaged enough?", a: "Unmanaged switches are genuinely plug-and-play with no configuration, fine for a simple home or small office network. Managed or smart-managed switches add VLANs, QoS, and traffic prioritization, useful once you have multiple network segments, guest WiFi isolation, or need to prioritize specific traffic types." },
  { key: "10gbe-cable-requirements", q: "What cable do I need to actually get 10Gbps over copper Ethernet?", a: "Cat6A or better is generally required for reliable 10GBASE-T at typical office/home distances; standard Cat6 can sometimes reach 10G over very short runs but isn't guaranteed, and Cat5e tops out well below 10G. Check your specific switch's documentation for its exact cable and distance requirements." },
  { key: "switch-fanless-heat", q: "Do fanless 10GbE switches actually run cooler, or just quieter?", a: "Fanless design means quieter operation through passive cooling, not necessarily cooler internal temperatures; copper 10G ports and SFP+ transceivers both generate real heat that a fanless chassis still needs to dissipate through its casing, so check the switch's rated operating temperature range." },
