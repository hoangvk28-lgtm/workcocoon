  { key: "watts-vs-watt-hours", q: "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?", a: "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly." },
  { key: "surge-vs-continuous", q: "Does a surge or peak wattage rating mean the station can run appliances at that power level?", a: "No. Surge or peak ratings describe a brief burst the inverter can handle, typically for a compressor or motor startup, not a sustained output level. Always check the continuous or rated wattage figure for what the station can actually run for extended periods." },
  { key: "lifepo4-battery-safety", q: "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?", a: "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety." },
  { key: "solar-panel-compatibility", q: "Can I use any solar panel with a portable power station?", a: "Not always. Some manufacturers restrict compatibility to their own branded panels or require a specific voltage and connector type, so check the station's documented solar input specs and connector type before assuming a third-party panel will work." },
  { key: "ups-switchover-meaning", q: "What does a UPS or EPS switchover time actually protect against?", a: "It's the delay before the station takes over powering a device after grid power cuts out. A shorter switchover time (under 20ms is common on current stations) reduces the risk of a computer, router, or medical device losing power or rebooting during a brief outage." },
  { key: "power-station-idle-drain", q: "Does a portable power station lose charge just sitting unused?", a: "Yes, to some degree. Standby or idle power draw varies significantly between models, from a few watts to over ten, so a station left unused for months can lose meaningful charge. Check the documented standby draw and follow the manufacturer's recommended periodic recharge interval." },
