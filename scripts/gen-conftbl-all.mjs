const sharedFaqPool = [
  { key: "seat-count-advertised", q: "Does the advertised seat count on a conference table match how many people actually fit?", a: "Not always. Manufacturers often count seats using minimal per-person edge space, so a table listed for 8 to 10 people may feel comfortable for 6 to 8 once laptops, notepads, and elbow room are accounted for. Check the table's actual length and depth against roughly 24 to 30 inches of edge space per seat before assuming the advertised count." },
  { key: "grommet-cable", q: "Does a cable grommet hole guarantee tidy cable management?", a: "A grommet hole only creates a pass-through point for wires; it does not route or organize cables on its own. Tables with a dedicated cable channel, in-leg routing, or a built-in power module keep cords genuinely tidy, while a bare grommet hole still requires the buyer to manage the run themselves." },
  { key: "assembly-package", q: "Why do some conference tables ship in more than one box?", a: "Larger conference tables, especially anything over roughly 6 feet, commonly ship in two or more packages to protect the tabletop and base during transit and to keep any single box within manageable shipping weight. The boxes can arrive on different days, so it is worth waiting for all of them before starting assembly." },
  { key: "mdf-particleboard-solid", q: "Is MDF or particle board construction a problem for a conference table?", a: "Not inherently. High-density MDF and particle board with a laminate or melamine finish are standard in this category and hold up well to daily commercial use. Solid wood, veneer over engineered wood, or steel-reinforced builds cost more and matter most where long-term durability or a premium look is the priority." },
  { key: "warranty-length", q: "What warranty should I expect on a conference table?", a: "Warranty terms vary widely in this category, from no stated warranty on some budget listings to a 1-year warranty on mid-range tables and multi-year coverage on commercial-grade systems from established office furniture brands. Check the specific listing rather than assuming a standard term." },
  { key: "power-outlet-source", q: "Do built-in power outlets on a conference table need a separate power source?", a: "Yes. A conference table's built-in AC outlets or USB ports still need to be wired into a wall circuit or floor power source; they are not battery powered. Confirm the table's power module can reach an outlet or your room's floor power box before installation, and check whether an electrician is needed for a hardwired connection." },
  { key: "weight-capacity", q: "How much weight can a typical conference table surface hold?", a: "Weight capacity varies by construction, with many MDF and particleboard tables in this category rated for normal laptop, monitor, and paperwork loads, while steel-reinforced or commercial-grade tables handle heavier daily use. Check the specific listing's stated capacity if you plan to place AV equipment or a large monitor array on the table." },

        { q: "How much room clearance does this table length need around it?", a: "Plan for at least 36 inches of clearance beyond the table's edge on all sides so chairs can push back fully and people can walk around during a meeting." },
      ];
    case "seatcount":
      return [
        { q: `Does the advertised seat count on this ${K} match real comfortable seating?`, a: "Check the table's actual length against roughly 24 to 30 inches of edge space per seat, since some listings count seats using tighter spacing than most buyers would find comfortable for a full-length meeting." },
        { q: "What table length do I need for this many seats?", a: "As a rough guide, multiply your target seat count by 24 to 30 inches per seat, then add extra length for any seats at the table ends, to estimate the minimum usable table length." },
      ];
    case "power":
      return [
        { q: `Do the outlets on a ${K} work without being plugged into a wall?`, a: "No. Built-in AC outlets and USB ports still need to connect to a wall circuit or floor power box; they are not battery powered, so confirm the table's power cord or infeed can reach an actual outlet." },
        { q: "Can a damaged power module be replaced without buying a new table?", a: "On some tables yes, if the module is a self-contained, swappable unit; on others the electronics are integrated into the base and harder to service separately. Check the listing or manufacturer support before assuming either way." },
      ];
    case "standing":
      return [
        { q: `Does a ${K} adjust with a crank, a lever, or an electric motor?`, a: "This varies by listing. Manual crank and pneumatic lever mechanisms are common on budget standing conference tables, while electric motorized lift is more common on premium models and adjusts faster with less physical effort." },
        { q: "How stable is a standing conference table at full height with a monitor on it?", a: "Check the table's stated weight capacity and any anti-wobble or stability features, since a table that feels solid empty can flex noticeably once loaded with monitors and equipment at its tallest setting." },

    case "expandable":
      return [
        { q: `How much bigger does an ${K} get when fully extended?`, a: "Check the listing for both collapsed and expanded dimensions specifically, since the difference between the two varies significantly by model, from a modest leaf addition to nearly doubling the table's length." },
        { q: "Where does the extension leaf store when not in use?", a: "This depends on the design; some leaves store flat underneath the table itself, while others require separate storage space nearby. Check the listing for specifics before assuming built-in storage is included." },
      ];
    case "shape":
      return [
        { q: `Does a ${K} need more floor space than a straight rectangular table?`, a: "Usually yes at its widest point. Measure the shape's full bounding box, not just its headline length, against your available floor space before assuming it fits the same footprint as a rectangular table." },
        { q: "Does the shape actually improve sightlines during a meeting?", a: "Curved and angled shapes generally do improve eye contact by reducing the length everyone has to see across compared to a long rectangle, but the improvement depends on the specific curve or angle and total table size." },
      ];
    case "mobility":
      return [
        { q: `Can a ${K} be moved by one person?`, a: "It depends on the table's weight and caster quality; lighter folding tables with quality casters can often be moved solo, while larger or heavier mobile tables are easier and safer to move with two people." },
        { q: "Do the wheels on a mobile conference table scratch hardwood floors?", a: "It depends on the caster material; hard plastic or metal casters can mark softer flooring over time, so check whether the specific table uses floor-protective casters if it will be rolled across hardwood or laminate floors regularly." },
      ];
    case "large":
      return [
        { q: `Does a ${K} ship as one piece or in sections?`, a: "Large conference tables commonly ship with the tabletop in two or more sections that join on site, since a single oversized piece would be impractical to ship and maneuver into most rooms." },
        { q: "How many people does a large conference table actually seat comfortably?", a: "Divide the table's usable length by roughly 24 to 30 inches per seat to estimate real comfortable capacity, since a large table's marketed seat count can assume tighter spacing than most buyers prefer." },
      ];
    case "small":
      return [
        { q: `How many people can realistically sit at a ${K}?`, a: "Most small conference tables in this category comfortably seat 4 to 6 people once real elbow room is accounted for, even when some listings market a higher maximum count." },
        { q: "Can a small conference table double as an office desk?", a: "Many can, since small conference tables and desks share similar height and surface dimensions, though check whether the table's depth suits a monitor and keyboard setup if you plan to use it that way." },
      ];
    default:
      return [
        { q: `What size room does a ${K} need?`, a: "Plan for the table's full footprint plus at least 36 inches of clearance on all sides so chairs can push back and people can walk around comfortably during a meeting." },
        { q: `How many people does a ${K} actually seat?`, a: "Check the table's real length and depth against roughly 24 to 30 inches of edge space per seat rather than trusting the advertised capacity number alone, since some listings count seats more tightly than is comfortable in practice." },
