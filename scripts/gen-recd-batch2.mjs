  { key: "raid-storage-lock", q: "Do reception desks with storage always include a lock?", a: "No. Many listings include one lockable drawer alongside open shelving or cabinets, but not every storage compartment locks. Check the specific listing for which drawers or cabinets are lockable versus open before assuming full document security." },
  { key: "grommet-cable", q: "Does a cable grommet hole guarantee tidy cable management?", a: "A grommet hole only creates a pass-through point for wires; it does not route or organize cables on its own. Desks with a dedicated cable trough, baffle, or labeled routing path keep cords genuinely tidy, while a bare grommet hole still requires the buyer to manage the run themselves." },
  { key: "counter-height-ada", q: "Is a raised transaction counter automatically ADA accessible?", a: "No. ADA accessibility depends on the installed counter height, approach type (forward or parallel), and surrounding clear floor space meeting current DOJ standards, not just the presence of a lower shelf. A desk marketed as having an accessible section should still be verified against the installed layout." },
  { key: "assembly-package", q: "Why do some reception desks ship in two separate boxes?", a: "Larger reception desks, especially those over roughly 70 inches, often ship in two packages to protect components during transit and reduce the risk of a single oversized box being damaged. The two boxes can arrive on different days, so it's worth waiting for both before starting assembly." },
  { key: "mdf-vs-solid", q: "Is MDF or particle board construction a problem for a reception desk?", a: "Not inherently. High-density MDF and particle board are standard in this category and hold up well to daily commercial use when finished with a scratch- and water-resistant laminate or paint layer. Solid wood or steel-reinforced builds cost more and matter most for higher-traffic or heavier-load installations." },
  { key: "warranty-length", q: "What warranty should I expect on a reception desk?", a: "Warranty terms vary widely in this category, from no stated warranty on some budget listings to a 1-year warranty on mid-range desks and multi-year coverage on commercial-grade systems from established office furniture brands. Check the specific listing rather than assuming a standard term." },
  { key: "led-power", q: "Do built-in LED lights and power outlets need a separate power source?", a: "Yes, desks with integrated LED strips or charging outlets need to be plugged into a standard wall outlet near the installation point; they are not battery-powered. Confirm an outlet is within reach of the desk's power cord before installation." },
  { key: "weight-capacity", q: "How much weight can a typical reception desk desktop hold?", a: "Weight capacity varies by construction, with many MDF and particleboard desks in this category rated between 200 and 250 lbs, and steel-reinforced or commercial-grade desks rated higher. Check the specific listing's weight rating if you plan to place heavy equipment like a large monitor array or point-of-sale hardware." },

      { q: "Do reception desk drawers use ball-bearing slides?", a: "Some do, particularly on commercial-grade desks, while budget options may use simpler slide mechanisms; ball-bearing slides generally handle heavier daily use and repeated opening more smoothly over time." },
      { q: "Can I add a lock to a reception desk drawer that doesn't include one?", a: "It's possible with an aftermarket drawer lock kit, but this requires drilling into the existing drawer and isn't guaranteed to fit every design cleanly, so choosing a desk with a factory-installed lock is generally more reliable." },

      { q: "How much desktop space does a POS system need on a retail reception desk?", a: "A typical POS setup (terminal, scanner, receipt printer) needs roughly 24 to 36 inches of dedicated desktop space; measure your specific equipment against the desk's usable width before buying." },
      { q: "Should bag and return staging be separate from the checkout counter?", a: "Yes, ideally. Keeping a dedicated bag or return landing area separate from the active checkout transaction space reduces congestion during busy periods and keeps the primary counter clear for scanning and payment." },
