The in-cabinet RJ45 jack lets you run networking equipment (a router or hotspot) stored alongside the devices, useful for a district piloting device provisioning at the cart level.\n\nA 2-year limited warranty backed by Chicago-based tech support is the real differentiator for a district-scale purchase: when you're deploying multiples of the same cart across buildings, having an actual support line beats hoping a no-name seller responds to a warranty claim. Pilot one cart before a multi-building order given the thin review base.\n\nTimed charging zones simplify IT troubleshooting across 42 outlets.

  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual bay geometry, not just the stated device count",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand the charging architecture and whether it can overload a circuit",
    "explanation": "A cart wired with simple AC pass-through outlets delivers full power to every outlet simultaneously, which can trip a circuit breaker if all bays are loaded and drawing power at once, while a cart with timed or zoned charging cycles devices through groups to stay within a safe total wattage draw.\n\nThis distinction matters a great deal at higher device counts, a 10-device cart drawing simultaneous full power is rarely an issue, but a 30 or 42-device cart without smart charging management is a real electrical risk on a standard household or classroom circuit.\n\nCheck the listing for total rated wattage and whether it explicitly mentions zoned or timed charging, not just the outlet count, especially for carts storing 20 or more devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider USB-C versus AC outlet charging for your specific device fleet",
    "explanation": "USB-C charging ports deliver power directly without needing each device's own separate power brick, simplifying cable management, but the actual charging wattage per port varies significantly between carts and isn't always disclosed, while AC outlet-based carts work with any device's own charger but require storing and managing that many separate power bricks inside the cart.\n\nThis matters directly for a mixed device fleet, a cart built around USB-C works cleanly for a uniform USB-C laptop or Chromebook fleet, but forces older or non-USB-C devices to use adapters or simply won't accommodate them.\n\nCheck whether the cart's charging ports match your actual device fleet's charging standard, and look for the specific per-port wattage rather than assuming USB-C alone means adequate charging speed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh loaded mobility and floor footprint against your actual space and routes",
    "explanation": "A cart that's easy to wheel around empty can behave very differently once loaded with 20-40 devices worth of weight, caster quality, wheel size, and overall build sturdiness matter more under real load, especially over thresholds, carpet transitions, or elevators.\n\nThis is worth checking before buying if the cart will regularly move between rooms or floors rather than stay parked in one spot, since a cart that's hard to maneuver loaded becomes a daily friction point.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of loaded mobility and caster durability over time, not just how it moves in an unboxing video with the cart empty."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Factor in locking security if the cart stores devices unattended",
    "explanation": "A cart's stated \"lockable\" feature can mean anything from a genuine keyed lock on a solid door to a simple latch that mostly deters casual access, and the actual security level matters a great deal if the cart will store expensive devices unattended overnight or in a semi-public space like a school hallway or shared office.\n\nThis is worth verifying directly rather than assuming any cart labeled \"lockable\" provides equivalent security, since a determined attempt at access can defeat a basic latch far more easily than a genuine keyed lock on a solid metal door.\n\nCheck the listing and reviews specifically for the lock mechanism type and door material, not just whether the word \"lockable\" appears in the title."
