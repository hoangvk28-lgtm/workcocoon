export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Confirm genuine Thunderbolt certification, not just a USB-C connector",
    explanation: "Thunderbolt is a specific hardware protocol, licensed and certified by Intel, that requires a genuine Thunderbolt controller chip inside the dock, and it's what actually unlocks running multiple high-resolution external displays plus full peripheral bandwidth simultaneously on a MacBook Pro. A dock that only uses a plain USB-C connection without real Thunderbolt certification, even if marketed loosely as \"Mac compatible,\" typically can't match that same multi-display and bandwidth performance. Look for the specific term \"Thunderbolt 4\" or \"Thunderbolt 5\" stated in the listing, ideally alongside mention of official Thunbolt certification, rather than a generic \"USB-C dock, works with Mac\" description."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match charging wattage to your specific MacBook Pro model's actual charger rating",
    explanation: "MacBook Pro models ship with different charger wattages depending on screen size and chip: 13 and 14-inch models typically use chargers in the 67-96W range, while 16-inch models commonly ship with a 140W charger. A dock rated for less charging wattage than your MacBook's included charger will still charge it, just more slowly than the original charger would, which matters if you're relying on the dock as your only power source during the day. Check the exact wattage printed on your MacBook Pro's included charger brick, then compare it against the dock's stated maximum charging wattage before assuming any dock fully replaces your charger's speed."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Understand that Thunderbolt 5's higher bandwidth requires a Thunderbolt 5-capable Mac port",
    explanation: "Thunderbolt 5 docks advertise significantly higher maximum bandwidth, up to 120Gbps on some models, compared to Thunderbolt 4's 40Gbps ceiling, but that higher bandwidth only becomes usable if your specific MacBook Pro's own Thunderbolt port also supports the Thunderbolt 5 standard. A Thunderbolt 5 dock plugged into an older Thunderbolt 4 MacBook Pro port still works normally, it just runs at the Thunderbolt 4 speed the Mac's port supports, meaning the extra bandwidth you paid for goes unused. Check your exact MacBook Pro model and generation's port specification (found in Apple's own tech specs page for that model) before paying a premium specifically for Thunderbolt 5 bandwidth."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check network port speed against your actual file transfer needs",
    explanation: "Docks in this comparison vary between standard Gigabit Ethernet and faster 2.5GbE networking, and that difference genuinely matters if you regularly transfer large files over a wired network connection, such as accessing a NAS or transferring large video project files, but makes little practical difference for typical web browsing and email over a wired connection. A 2.5GbE port only delivers its faster speed if your router or network switch on the other end also supports 2.5GbE, so check your existing network hardware's capability before treating faster ethernet as an automatic upgrade worth paying extra for."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Count your actual simultaneous peripheral needs against total port count",
    explanation: "Docks in this comparison range from around 8 total ports up to 20, and a higher port count only matters if you actually have that many simultaneous peripherals: external displays, drives, a keyboard and mouse dongle, an SD card reader, audio interface, and similar accessories all competing for a port at once. Paying extra for a 20-port dock when you typically connect only a monitor, keyboard, and mouse means paying for capacity you'll rarely use, while an 8-port dock can leave you scrambling for adapters if your actual desk setup grows. Count your real simultaneous peripheral needs, including any you plan to add soon, before choosing a dock based on port count alone."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Do I need a Thunderbolt-certified dock, or will any USB-C dock work with my MacBook Pro?",
    a: "A plain USB-C dock will charge your Mac and connect basic peripherals, but only a genuinely Thunderbolt-certified dock unlocks running multiple high-resolution external displays and full peripheral bandwidth simultaneously. If you only need one display and basic USB accessories, a cheaper USB-C hub may suffice; for multi-display setups, Thunderbolt certification matters."
  },
  {
    q: "Is Thunderbolt 5 worth paying more for if my MacBook Pro only has Thunderbolt 4 ports?",
    a: "Not for the bandwidth itself. A Thunderbolt 5 dock plugged into a Thunderbolt 4 Mac port runs at Thunderbolt 4 speeds, meaning the extra bandwidth goes unused. Check your specific MacBook Pro model's port specification before paying a premium specifically for Thunderbolt 5."
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 100W charging dock fully charge my 16-inch MacBook Pro at full speed?",
    a: "Not at the same speed as its included charger, which is typically rated at 140W. A 100W dock still charges the laptop, just more slowly than the original charger would under heavy use. If you need full-speed charging through the dock, look for one rated at 140W or higher."
  },
  {
    q: "Do these docks require installing any software drivers on my Mac?",
    a: "Most genuinely Thunderbolt-certified docks in this comparison are designed to work driverless with macOS, meaning the Mac recognizes the dock's ports natively without a separate software install. Check the specific listing for explicit \"driverless\" language to confirm before buying if this matters to you."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I connect more than one external display through these docks?",
    a: "Yes, every pick in this comparison supports at least dual 4K displays or a single higher-resolution display like 6K or 8K. Check the specific listing's stated maximum display configuration against your actual monitor setup, since supported resolutions and display count vary between picks."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do Mac-specific Thunderbolt docks cost more than generic USB-C hubs?",
    a: "Genuine Thunderbolt certification requires a licensed Thunderbolt controller chip, which costs manufacturers significantly more than a standard USB-C hub chipset, and that cost passes through to the retail price. This is why real Thunderbolt-certified docks in this category start well above the price of basic USB-C hubs."
