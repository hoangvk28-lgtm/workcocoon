  "A docking station for Surface Pro or Surface Laptop has to account for a quirk most generic docking guides skip over entirely: not every Surface generation even has a USB-C port capable of driving a dock. Surface Pro 7 and earlier, along with Surface Laptop 3 and earlier, relied mainly on Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect port with only limited USB-C, while Surface Pro 8 through 11 and Surface Laptop 4 through 6 added full USB-C and Thunderbolt support that makes them compatible with the same docks used on any other Windows laptop.\n\nBelow are 8 docking stations we evaluated on port count, power delivery, display support, and how well each one fits Surface's tablet-first use pattern, where the device gets undocked and redocked far more often than a typical clamshell laptop, ranging from a $26.96 budget USB-C hub to a certified Thunderbolt 4 dock built for triple-display setups.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Does my Surface Pro even have a USB-C port for a docking station?",
    a: "It depends on the generation. Surface Pro 7 and earlier rely mainly on the proprietary Surface Connect port with only limited USB-C at best, so a docking station may not work as expected. Surface Pro 8 through 11 added full USB-C and, on some models, Thunderbolt support, making them compatible with the docks in this guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a USB4 dock the same as a Thunderbolt-certified dock for Surface?",
    a: "No. USB4 docks are broadly \"should work\" compatible with Thunderbolt devices, but they don't go through the same strict Intel certification process that guarantees Thunderbolt 4 or 5 compatibility. If your Surface has a genuine Thunderbolt port, picks like the Plugable 16-in-1 Thunderbolt 4 Dock carry that certification and remove a layer of compatibility guesswork.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why isn't my Surface charging at full speed through the dock?",
    a: "A dock rated for a given wattage typically delivers about 10-15W less to the laptop once the dock's own circuitry draws its share. A dock rated for 100W might deliver closer to 85-90W in practice, which is still enough for most Surface devices but worth accounting for if you're near the edge of your model's charging needs.",
  },
  {
    q: "My Surface's display keeps flickering when docked. What's wrong?",
    a: "This is a known issue on Surface hardware more than on standard laptops, tied to how Windows handles external GPU signaling on 2-in-1 devices, especially at high refresh rates. Checking for a firmware update on the dock is a genuinely useful first troubleshooting step most guides never mention.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I prioritize port count or portability for a Surface dock?",
    a: "It depends on how you use the device. Surface tablets get undocked and redocked far more often than typical clamshell laptops, so if you frequently work away from your desk, a compact pick like the Anker Nano 8-in-1 or Anker Laptop 8-in-1 fits better than a bulkier, higher-port-count dock meant to stay permanently connected.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my dock keep randomly disconnecting?",
    a: "Heavy simultaneous use, dual displays plus a fast file transfer plus a connected USB drive, can saturate the dock's USB bus and cause disconnects that look like a hardware failure but are really a bandwidth or load issue. A long, generic USB-C cable between the dock and the Surface is another common hidden cause worth ruling out.",
