export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 30W Input Rating Doesn't Guarantee a Full 30W Reaches Your Connected Device",
    "explanation": "The Davuaz Gigabit pick specifically discloses 30W power input but only up to 24W total output, an honest 6W gap that occurs because some power is consumed internally by the extender itself or lost in the power-sharing process across multiple ports. This matters significantly if your device specifically requires close to the full 30W IEEE 802.3at rating to function correctly, since a device expecting 30W might not receive adequate power from an extender that only outputs 24W total. Check a listing specifically for its output wattage figure, not just its input rating, before assuming your 30W-rated device will receive full power."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Port Extenders Share Their Total Wattage Budget Rather Than Giving Each Port the Full Rated Power Independently",
    "explanation": "The Tliffpaco pick specifically states intelligent power allocation between its two ports up to 25.5W max each, meaning the two ports share and dynamically adjust within a combined budget rather than each independently supporting a full 30W simultaneously. This matters if you're connecting two devices that both draw close to the maximum rated wattage, since intelligent allocation might reduce power to one port when the other draws more. Check whether a multi-port extender specifically states independent full-power ports or shared/allocated power across ports before assuming every port can be maxed out at once."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Switchable Speed-Versus-Distance Mode Lets One Physical Unit Serve Two Different Installation Needs",
    "explanation": "The Davuaz 100Mbps pick specifically includes a switch to enter extension mode, reaching 250m at 10Mbps instead of the standard 100m at 100Mbps, letting the same physical unit handle either a standard-distance high-bandwidth need or an extended-distance lower-bandwidth need depending on the switch position. This matters if you're not certain in advance which tradeoff a specific installation will need, or if you want one product that can flexibly serve either scenario, and matters less if you have a fixed, known distance and bandwidth requirement. Check whether an extender offers a switchable mode if that flexibility could simplify your equipment planning across multiple installations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Metal Housing With Waterproof-Capped Cable Ports Provides Different Durability Than a Plastic Enclosure",
    "explanation": "The WAVLINK pick's rugged, industrial-grade metal housing with waterproof caps on all cable ports offers greater physical durability and more thorough water protection at the connection points than the plastic housings on the Tliffpaco and Davuaz picks, though at a meaningfully higher price. This matters if physical durability and thorough water protection are priorities for your specific outdoor installation, and matters less for a sheltered or lower-exposure location where a plastic housing performs adequately. Weigh a metal housing's durability and cable-port protection against its higher price if your installation doesn't specifically demand that level of build quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Guarantee Timeframe Gives Concrete, Checkable Recourse Compared to Vague Support Language",
    "explanation": "Both Davuaz picks specifically state a 24-hour worry-free guarantee promising a hassle-free refund or replacement, a concrete timeframe commitment distinct from vague 'customer satisfaction' language that doesn't specify how quickly you can expect a resolution if a problem arises. This matters if you want assurance of a fast resolution timeline for a budget-priced device, and matters less if you're comfortable with a standard return window regardless of stated response speed. Check for a specific guarantee timeframe rather than general support language if quick resolution matters to your purchase decision."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a 30W PoE extender always deliver the full 30W to my connected device?", "a": "Not necessarily; the Davuaz Gigabit pick specifically discloses only 24W total output despite a 30W input rating, so checking a listing's actual output wattage figure rather than just its input rating is worth doing before buying." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 30W PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming the 30W input rating means the full 30W reaches each connected device, when several extenders specifically disclose a lower total or per-port output wattage than the input figure suggests." },
  { "q": "Is the WAVLINK extender worth the higher price over the Tliffpaco pick?", "a": "If you specifically need a metal, IP67-rated housing for a single high-power device at extended distance, the WAVLINK's higher price is justified, but for powering multiple standard devices at a lower cost, the Tliffpaco pick delivers strong value." },
  { "q": "Can I switch between fast speed and long distance on the same extender?", "a": "Yes, the Davuaz 100Mbps pick specifically includes a switch to enter extension mode, trading standard 100Mbps speed for a 250m reach at a reduced 10Mbps, giving you that flexibility on one physical unit." },
  { "q": "Do I need a 30W extender for a standard IP camera, or is a lower wattage extender enough?", "a": "Standard IP cameras typically use 15.4W under the older 802.3af standard, so a 30W extender is specifically necessary only if your camera or device requires the higher IEEE 802.3at (PoE+) power tier." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my device needs the full 30W or can work with a lower output?", "a": "Checking your specific device's power specification label or documentation for its exact wattage requirement, then matching that against an extender's disclosed output (not just input) wattage, is the reliable way to confirm adequate power delivery." }
