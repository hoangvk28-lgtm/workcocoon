// ─── Common mistakes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const mistakes = [
  {
    title: "Buying a converter for a desk under 30 inches wide",
    body: "Most converters need 30–32 inches of desk width and 15+ inches of depth to sit stably. Measure your desk before buying. A desk under 30 inches wide cannot safely support a standard converter.",
  },
  {
    title: "Expecting a lap desk to replace ergonomics",
    body: "Lap desks are better than hunching, but they cannot replicate proper monitor height (eye level) or keyboard ergonomics. For 6+ hour workdays, a converter (or a height-adjustable desk) is the appropriate tool.",
  },
  {
    title: "Over-buying a converter for occasional standing",
    body: "If you stand for 30 minutes a day, a $120+ converter is hard to justify. For light use, a simple monitor riser + standing mat achieves similar posture changes at a fraction of the cost.",
  },
  {
    title: "Using a lap desk without a cooling pad on a hot laptop",
    body: "Lap desks reduce airflow under the laptop. For resource-intensive tasks (video editing, gaming), use a lap desk with a built-in cooling fan (like the Nnewvante) or add a USB cooling pad.",

// ─── FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const faq: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
  {
    q: "Is a lap desk worth it?",
    a: "Yes, if you regularly work or study on a couch, bed, or without a desk. A lap desk with a wrist rest (like the LapGear Home Office Pro at $28–$40) reduces neck strain and provides a stable typing surface. For 8-hour desk workers, a converter is a better investment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a standing desk converter worth buying?",
    a: "For 6+ hour workdays with back or neck pain, yes. Alternating between sitting and standing every 30–60 minutes reduces the health risks of prolonged sitting. A $80–$150 converter is significantly cheaper than replacing a full desk and works on any existing surface.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a standing desk converter fit on a small desk?",
    a: "Yes — the FLEXISPOT 31\" fits desks as narrow as 36 inches. Measure your desk's width and depth before buying. Most converters need at least 30 in width and 15 in depth.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best lap desk for working in bed?",
    a: "The SAIJI Adjustable Bed Tray ($75–$98) is the most versatile — height adjusts 10–17 inches, tilt adjusts 0–45°, and the bamboo surface is stable and heat-resistant. For a budget option, the LapGear Home Office Pro ($28–$40) is the most popular choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do you need to stand each day to benefit?",
    a: "Research suggests alternating sitting and standing every 30–60 minutes is more beneficial than extended standing. Total standing time of 2–4 hours per workday is a reasonable target. A converter that's easy to raise and lower encourages this habit more than one with friction-heavy mechanisms.",
