  {
    q: "What is the difference between a coccyx cushion and a regular seat cushion?",
    a: "A coccyx cushion has a U-shaped or V-shaped cutout at the rear that creates open space where the tailbone sits, preventing contact with the seat. A regular flat cushion provides even padding across the full seat. Coccyx cushions are for tailbone pain relief. Regular cushions are better for general fatigue and broad pressure distribution.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a seat cushion fix lower back pain?",
    a: "No. A seat cushion addresses pressure from below: tailbone, hips, and thighs. Lower back pain originates from the lumbar spine area and requires a separate lumbar support pillow. If you have both issues, use a seat cushion plus a lumbar pillow. A seat cushion alone will not resolve lower back pain.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do memory foam seat cushions last?",
    a: "Standard memory foam cushions at $30 to $50 typically maintain effective support for 6 to 12 months under daily use. Extra-dense foam options like Cushion Lab are designed to last 12 to 24 months. Gel-infused foam lasts comparably to standard memory foam.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a seat cushion change my desk ergonomics?",
    a: "Yes. Adding a 3 to 4 centimeter cushion raises seated height, affecting arm angle relative to your desk and eye level relative to your monitor. After adding a seat cushion, raise your chair height to restore a 90-degree knee bend, then check if your monitor needs to be raised.",
  },
  {
    q: "What seat cushion is best for sciatica?",
    a: "A gel-infused coccyx cushion like the Everlasting Comfort reduces seat pressure that can aggravate the sciatic nerve. Some users with sciatica prefer flat contoured cushions like the Cushion Lab options since they distribute weight evenly. Try both types if possible since sciatica presentations vary significantly between individuals.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if my seat cushion is the right size?",
    a: "Measure your chair's seat pan width and depth. Most standard office chair cushions are 17 by 13 to 18 by 14 inches. Gaming chairs and executive chairs are often wider than 19 inches and may need an XL size.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a seat cushion or a lumbar support pillow first?",
    a: "Identify where your discomfort is. Seat cushions address pressure from below: tailbone, hips, thighs. Lumbar pillows address the lower back curve. If discomfort is in your lower back, start with a lumbar pillow. If discomfort is at the seat surface, start with a seat cushion.",
