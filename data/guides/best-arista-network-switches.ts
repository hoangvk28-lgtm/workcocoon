    "title": "Port Count & Speed Tier",

  },
  {
    "title": "PoE Power Budget",
    "description": "Checked the total PoE wattage budget against realistic device counts, not just the per-port maximum, since a switch's total power pool is what actually limits how many cameras or access points it can run."

export const howToChoose: HowToChooseSection[] = [
  {
    "subheading": "Is Arista Overkill for Your Use Case?",
    "note": "Arista's power draw, active cooling noise, and data-center airflow design (back-to-front) make it a poor fit for a typical home or small office. This is genuinely appropriate hardware for a homelab operator running serious 10G/40G workloads or a small business with real data center-style infrastructure, not a general small-business network upgrade."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Port count is a headroom decision, not a current-need one",
    "explanation": "Buy for what you'll plug in over the next 2-3 years, not just today. An 8-port switch that's already full the day it arrives means buying a second switch and daisy-chaining, which adds a hop of latency and another point of failure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE budget is a shared pool, not per-port",
    "explanation": "A switch rated for 8 PoE+ ports at 120W total does not mean every port gets 30W simultaneously. Add up the real draw of every camera, AP, and phone you'll connect, and make sure the total budget clears it with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Managed vs unmanaged changes what you can diagnose later",
    "explanation": "An unmanaged switch is zero-configuration but gives you no visibility when something goes wrong. A smart-managed switch adds VLANs, port mirroring, and traffic monitoring for a modest price increase, worth it the first time you need to isolate a misbehaving device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless does not always mean silent under load",
    "explanation": "Most desktop switches are genuinely fanless and silent, but high-port-count PoE switches sometimes add active cooling once the power budget climbs past 200-300W. Check for a fan explicitly if a quiet office or bedroom install matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speed needs matching cable and network gear",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G or 10G switch only delivers those speeds if your cabling is Cat5e or better (Cat6a for 10G) and the devices on both ends actually support that speed. Mixing a multi-gig switch into an all-Gigabit network gets you nothing extra."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Renewed enterprise gear needs a licensing check first",
    "explanation": "Cisco Meraki, Juniper, and some Aruba/HPE switches on Amazon are frequently sold as renewed hardware without an active license or support contract. Confirm what functions before assuming a discounted enterprise switch works like a new one out of the box."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is renewed Arista hardware reliable?",
    "a": "Generally yes for the hardware itself, Arista builds for continuous data center operation. The bigger question is EOS software support and licensing on renewed units, worth confirming before assuming full feature parity with new hardware."
