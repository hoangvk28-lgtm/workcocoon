export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Port Injector's Total Power Budget Is Shared Across All Connected Devices, Not Per-Port",
    "explanation": "A listing's total wattage, like the 8-port pick's 60W budget, is divided among however many devices you actually connect, meaning 8 devices each drawing close to the maximum share could exceed the total budget even though each individual port could theoretically handle more in isolation. This matters significantly if you're powering higher-draw devices like PTZ cameras across many ports simultaneously, and matters less if your devices are low-draw items like basic VoIP phones that use only a small fraction of the available per-port share. Add up your actual devices' combined power draw and compare it against the injector's total stated wattage budget, not just the per-port maximum, before assuming full capacity is available."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Passive PoE at the Multi-Port Tier Requires Confirming Mode A or Mode B Compatibility With Your Specific Devices",
    "explanation": "Passive PoE injectors deliver power on a specific pin configuration, either Mode A (pins 1,2 and 3,6) or Mode B (pins 4,5 and 7,8), and while most modern 802.3af/at devices support both modes automatically, confirming your specific device's compatibility avoids a rare mismatch. This matters more if you're connecting older or less common equipment where mode support isn't guaranteed, and matters less with standard modern IP cameras and access points that typically support both modes. Check your device's own documentation for its supported PoE mode if you have any uncertainty, particularly with older or specialized hardware."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Right-Sizing Port Count to Your Actual Device Count Avoids a Steep, Unnecessary Price Jump",
    "explanation": "The price difference between tiers in a multi-port injector line isn't linear, jumping from roughly $48 for 8 ports to nearly $175 for 12 ports in this comparison, meaning buying more headroom than you need costs disproportionately more than the extra capacity is worth if you don't have concrete plans to use it. This matters significantly for a budget-conscious deployment where every dollar counts, and matters less for an organization planning known near-term expansion where buying ahead avoids a second purchase and installation visit later. Count your actual current devices plus any confirmed near-term additions before choosing a port-count tier, rather than defaulting to the next size up as a safety margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fast Ethernet Versus Gigabit Speed Matters More at Higher Device Counts Where Aggregate Bandwidth Adds Up",
    "explanation": "A single 100Mbps device rarely feels a real-world speed limitation, but when you're running 8, 12, or 24 devices through a shared multi-port injector, the aggregate bandwidth need across all connected devices, especially cameras streaming continuously, can meaningfully benefit from Gigabit-per-port speed compared to Fast Ethernet. This matters more for a camera-heavy deployment where multiple high-resolution feeds run simultaneously, and matters less for a phone-heavy deployment where each device's individual bandwidth need is minimal regardless of port speed. Check whether your specific mix of devices and their combined bandwidth need justifies paying for Gigabit over Fast Ethernet at your chosen port count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Whether a Power Supply Is Included in the Listed Price Significantly Affects the Real Total Cost at Larger Port Counts",
    "explanation": "At higher port counts, the power supply itself becomes a more substantial cost component, and confirming whether a listing's price already includes a UL-approved power supply, as several picks in this comparison do, avoids an unexpected additional purchase to actually get the unit running. This matters for accurately comparing prices across different multi-port injector options, since two listings with similar headline prices could differ meaningfully in real total cost if one requires a separately purchased power supply. Check the listing's included-items section specifically for confirmation the power supply is bundled before finalizing a budget comparison."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How many devices can a multi-port PoE injector actually support?", "a": "Check both the stated port count and the total power budget together; a device count matching the port count only works if your devices' combined power draw stays within the total wattage the unit provides." },
  { "q": "Is a multi-port PoE injector cheaper than a PoE switch?", "a": "Often yes, especially if you already have a working non-PoE switch, since a midspan injector lets you add PoE capability without replacing that switch entirely, though at very high port counts the price gap narrows." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between Mode A and Mode B passive PoE?", "a": "They're different pin configurations for delivering power over the Ethernet cable, and most modern 802.3af/at devices support both automatically, though it's worth confirming with older or specialized equipment." },
  { "q": "Should I buy a larger port-count unit than I currently need?", "a": "Only if you have concrete near-term plans to add more devices, since the price jump between port-count tiers is substantial relative to the extra unused capacity you'd otherwise be paying for." },
  { "q": "Do I need Gigabit speed for a multi-port PoE injector powering security cameras?", "a": "For higher-resolution or multiple simultaneous camera feeds, yes; for basic single cameras or a phone-heavy deployment, Fast Ethernet (10/100Mbps) is often sufficient and available at a lower cost." },
  { "q": "Can a multi-port PoE injector be rack-mounted?", "a": "Higher port-count units, like the 24-port pick in this comparison, are specifically designed for rack mounting, while smaller 4 and 8-port units are typically standalone desktop or wall-mounted designs." }
