What actually varies is CPU class and network port speed, both of which determine how fast that first full backup completes and how the NAS holds up running Time Machine alongside other tasks.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Understand that every NAS here supports Time Machine the same basic way",
    explanation: "Time Machine on macOS backs up to any network location that exposes a standard SMB (Server Message Block) file share, and every consumer NAS operating system in this comparison, whether Synology's DSM, QNAP's QTS, Asustor's ADM, or UGREEN's own OS, creates this kind of share as a core, built-in feature. This means Time Machine compatibility itself isn't a genuine differentiator between these NAS units the way it might be with a niche or unusual device; the real differences are in CPU speed, network port speed, and how polished the setup process feels, not whether Time Machine works at all. Don't pay extra for a listing that specifically advertises \"Time Machine compatible\" as if it were a rare feature, since it's standard across this entire product category."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check for a named CPU model, not just a bay count and RAM figure",
    explanation: "A NAS's processor determines how quickly it can handle a large Time Machine backup, especially the very first full backup, which can involve transferring hundreds of gigabytes at once, and some listings name a specific CPU model (like an ARM Cortex-A55 or a stated clock speed) while others only describe the unit generally without a comparable spec. A named CPU lets you look up its real-world performance benchmarks if you want to dig deeper, while a vague description gives you nothing concrete to compare against a competing unit. Prioritize listings that state an actual processor model and RAM amount over ones that only describe general capability."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match network port speed to your actual home network capability",
    explanation: "A NAS with a 2.5GbE network port can theoretically transfer data at 2.5 times the speed of a standard Gigabit Ethernet port, but only if the device on the other end, your Mac's network adapter and your router or switch, also supports 2.5GbE. If your home network is entirely standard Gigabit, paying extra for a 2.5GbE-equipped NAS provides no real speed benefit until you upgrade the rest of your network too. Check your router's spec sheet and your Mac's built-in or adapter ethernet port rating before choosing a NAS specifically for its network speed."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Choose a 2-bay design if you want backup redundancy, not just capacity",
    explanation: "A single-bay NAS stores your Time Machine backup on exactly one hard drive, meaning that drive's failure means losing your entire backup history with no recovery option. A 2-bay NAS lets you configure RAID 1 (mirroring), where the same data is written to two drives simultaneously, so one drive failing doesn't lose your backup, at the cost of effectively halving your total usable capacity compared to using both drives independently. If Time Machine is your only backup of important data, prioritize a 2-bay design specifically for that redundancy rather than choosing based on raw capacity numbers alone."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weigh an established NAS operating system's ecosystem against a newer platform's price advantage",
    explanation: "Synology's DSM and QNAP's QTS have been refined over many years, resulting in extensive official documentation, large user communities that have already solved most common setup problems, and broad third-party app support for tasks beyond simple backup. Newer NAS platforms can offer competitive or lower hardware pricing but come with a shorter track record, meaning fewer forum threads and guides exist if you hit an unusual setup issue. If this is your first NAS and you value having documentation readily available for every step, an established platform is worth the price premium; if you're comfortable troubleshooting independently, a newer platform's lower price is a reasonable tradeoff."

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Do I need a special NAS model specifically for Time Machine, or does any NAS work?",
    a: "Any NAS running a standard operating system (DSM, QTS, ADM, or similar) that exposes an SMB network share works with Time Machine, since that's the standard connection method macOS uses. Every pick in this comparison supports this natively; the real differences between them are CPU speed, network port speed, and setup polish, not Time Machine compatibility itself."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 2.5GbE NAS worth paying more for if I only have a standard Gigabit router?",
    a: "Not immediately. A 2.5GbE port only provides a real speed benefit when both the NAS and the device on the other end of the connection, including your router or switch, also support 2.5GbE. If your network is entirely standard Gigabit, the extra speed capability goes unused until you upgrade the rest of your network."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to buy hard drives separately for these NAS units?",
    a: "Yes. Every pick in this comparison is sold diskless, meaning you supply your own compatible hard drives or SSDs separately. Check the specific NAS model's compatible drive list and your budget for drives before finalizing your total cost."
  },
  {
    q: "What's the benefit of a 2-bay NAS over a cheaper single-bay model?",
    a: "A 2-bay NAS lets you configure RAID 1 mirroring, where your data is written to two drives simultaneously so one drive failing doesn't lose your Time Machine backup. If your backup is your only safety net for important data, that redundancy is worth prioritizing over a cheaper single-bay design."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the first Time Machine backup to a NAS typically take?",
    a: "It depends heavily on how much data you're backing up and your network speed, since the first backup transfers your entire drive's used contents at once. A NAS with a faster network port (2.5GbE) and a Mac with matching networking capability can meaningfully reduce this initial backup time compared to standard Gigabit Ethernet."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use one of these NAS units for anything besides Time Machine backup?",
    a: "Yes, all four picks in this comparison run a full NAS operating system capable of much more than backup, including file sharing, media streaming, and in some cases running additional apps. Synology and QNAP in particular have the broadest third-party app ecosystems if you plan to expand beyond simple backup duty later."
