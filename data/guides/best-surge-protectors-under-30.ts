export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Phone and Data Line Surge Protection Addresses a Real Vulnerability AC-Only Protection Misses Entirely",
    "explanation": "The TLP604TEL pick's RJ-11 telephone line suppression jacks specifically protect against surges traveling through phone, fax, or DSL modem lines, a genuinely different entry point for electrical surges than the AC outlets every surge protector addresses. If your home office still uses a landline phone, fax machine, or DSL internet connection, a surge entering through that phone line can damage connected equipment even if your AC outlets are fully protected by a different surge protector. Check specifically for RJ-11 or similar phone line protection if any of your equipment connects through a telephone line rather than assuming AC surge protection alone covers every entry point."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rotating Outlets Solve a Physical Plug-Access Problem Fixed Outlets Genuinely Create",
    "explanation": "The SWIVEL6 pick's independently rotating outlets let you angle each outlet to match your specific plug's shape and the surrounding space, while a fixed-outlet design can make removing or inserting certain oversized or oddly angled plugs awkward, especially in a tight wall tap format. This matters specifically in cramped locations like behind furniture or on a crowded kitchen counter, where plug angle flexibility genuinely changes how easy the device is to use day to day. Consider your actual plug shapes and available space before assuming a fixed-outlet design will be equally convenient."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "EMI/RFI Noise Filtering Matters More for Audio and Video Equipment Than for Basic Household Devices",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower HT812TC's built-in EMI/RFI noise filter specifically reduces interference that can degrade audio and video quality in a home theater setup, a benefit that's largely irrelevant if you're just powering lamps or a phone charger but genuinely valuable for a receiver, TV, or speaker system sensitive to electrical noise. This filtering addresses a different problem than surge protection itself, since surges are sudden voltage spikes while line noise is a more constant interference affecting signal quality. Prioritize noise filtering specifically if your setup includes audio or video equipment sensitive to this kind of interference, rather than treating it as a universal must-have feature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Slim, Concealable Design With High Joule Rating Represents a Genuine Engineering Achievement, Not Just Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "The ECHOGEAR pick packs 3420 joules of surge protection into a genuinely slim, easily concealable form factor, a combination that's harder to achieve than either high joule rating or slim design alone, since surge protection components typically require more internal space as joule capacity increases. This matters if you specifically want to hide the surge protector behind furniture or under a desk while still getting substantial protection capacity. Check whether a listing specifically addresses both joule rating and physical slimness together, since achieving both simultaneously reflects more deliberate engineering than either specification in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Safety Covers Provide a Real Safety Benefit in Households with Young Children",
    "explanation": "The ECHOGEAR pick's built-in safety covers over unused outlets specifically prevent a child from inserting foreign objects like paper clips into open outlet slots, a genuine child safety consideration that a surge protector without this feature doesn't address, regardless of its joule rating or other capabilities. This matters directly if young children have access to the room where the surge protector is used, and it's a feature worth checking for specifically rather than assuming any surge protector with unused outlets is equally safe around curious kids. Check for this specific safety feature if child safety is a genuine concern for your household."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need phone line surge protection if I only use a cell phone and don't have a landline?", "a": "No, RJ-11 phone line protection specifically guards devices connected via a physical telephone line, so if you don't have a landline, fax machine, or DSL modem, this specific feature won't provide any benefit and a pick without it, like the ECHOGEAR or CyberPower, would serve you just as well." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a surge protector for a home theater setup?", "a": "Choosing based on joule rating alone without checking for EMI/RFI noise filtering, which specifically improves audio and video quality in ways that raw surge protection capacity doesn't address." },
  { "q": "Is the ECHOGEAR ShockBlocker worth it over the CyberPower home theater pick for a media console?", "a": "If maximum joule protection and slim concealability matter most, the ECHOGEAR's 3420J rating is the stronger choice, but if you specifically want noise filtering tuned to reduce interference for audio and video quality, the CyberPower pick is purpose-built for that need." },
  { "q": "How do rotating outlets on the SWIVEL6 actually make plugging in devices easier?", "a": "Each of the 6 outlets pivots independently, letting you angle the outlet to match an oddly shaped or oversized plug's orientation, which can make insertion and removal noticeably easier compared to a fixed outlet that only accepts plugs at one fixed angle." },
  { "q": "Does a lower joule rating on the TLP604TEL mean it's a worse overall choice than the ECHOGEAR pick?", "a": "Not necessarily worse overall, just differently specialized; the TLP604TEL trades some raw joule capacity for genuine phone and modem line protection that the higher-joule ECHOGEAR pick doesn't offer at all, so the better choice depends on whether you actually need that phone line protection." },
  { "q": "Can I use the CyberPower home theater surge protector for non-AV devices like a computer or printer?", "a": "Yes, its surge protection and outlets work for any standard AC device, though its specific EMI/RFI noise filtering benefit is most relevant to audio and video equipment rather than general computing devices." }
