export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Your Exact Mac Chip Generation, Not Just the Dock, Determines Your Real Multi-Monitor Ceiling",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY pick specifically documents five different display tiers by exact chip, from a single display on base M1 through M3 chips up to quad 6K displays only on the newest M5 Max chip, showing that the same dock delivers dramatically different real-world multi-monitor capability depending entirely on which Mac you own. This matters significantly if you're buying a dock specifically to run two or three external monitors on an older Mac, since a dock's headline display count may simply not be achievable on your specific chip generation. Check a dock's listing for your exact Mac chip tier's documented display count before assuming its best-case advertised number applies to your particular machine."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Windows and macOS Multi-Monitor Support Often Differs Substantially on the Identical Physical Dock",
    "explanation": "The Kensington pick specifically states Windows laptops can reach three 4K@144Hz displays or two 8K displays, while the same dock's Mac support tops out at two 4K@60Hz displays via HDMI, a real and substantial difference in capability from one operating system to the other on identical hardware. This matters if you're specifically choosing a dock to maximize your multi-monitor setup and use a Mac, since assuming Windows-quoted specs will carry over can lead to a real capability gap after purchase. Read a dock's platform-specific display specs for your actual operating system, not just its single best-case headline number, before making your final choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Independent Video Output Types (HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C) Matter More When Running Several Different Monitors",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick specifically supports triple 4K displays via HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C simultaneously and independently, which matters if your multiple monitors use different connection types rather than all sharing the same input, since a dock relying mainly on one port type (like multiple HDMI outputs) may not match a mixed-monitor setup as cleanly. This matters significantly if you're combining an older HDMI monitor with a newer USB-C display, and matters less if all your monitors share the same input type already. Check exactly which video output types a dock provides and in what combination, rather than assuming any three ports will accommodate any three monitors equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Real-World Transfer Benchmark Helps Contextualize a Dock's Bandwidth Boost Feature for Multi-Display Setups",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY pick's specifically stated theoretical benchmark of transferring a 21GB movie in just 2 seconds via its Bandwidth Boost feature gives a concrete, relatable sense of what 120Gb/s bandwidth actually means in practice, more intuitive than comparing raw Gbps figures across competing docks when you're also trying to understand how that bandwidth gets shared with demanding multi-monitor output. This matters if you're running both several high-refresh monitors and fast file transfers simultaneously, and matters less if your workload is display-only. Look for a dock listing that provides a concrete real-world transfer time example alongside its display specs, since this gives a more intuitive sense of how bandwidth is actually shared between video and data."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Undocked Charging Feature Can Matter as Much as Its Display Count for a Multi-Monitor Desk Setup",
    "explanation": "The Kensington pick's specifically named KonstantCharge feature keeps connected devices charging even when your laptop itself is undocked from the hub, a genuinely useful capability for a multi-monitor desk setup where you might briefly disconnect your laptop while still wanting peripherals like a phone or tablet to keep charging. This matters if you frequently undock your laptop while leaving other devices connected to the hub, and matters less if you only ever use the dock with your laptop attached. Check whether a dock specifically names an undocked-charging capability if you plan to use it as a general charging hub beyond just your primary laptop."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will any Thunderbolt 5 dock give me three 4K monitors at full refresh rate on any laptop?", "a": "No, three 4K@144Hz displays specifically require a genuine Thunderbolt 5 host and, on a Mac, a Pro or Max chip tier, so checking both your laptop's Thunderbolt generation and exact chip against the dock's documented specs is necessary before assuming triple-display support." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a multi-monitor Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming a dock's best-case advertised display count applies to their exact laptop, when Mac chip tier and operating system frequently create real, substantial differences in actual achievable display count on the identical dock." },
  { "q": "Is the CalDigit TS5 worth the higher price if I only need dual monitors, not maximum ports?", "a": "If you only need dual 8K display support without extensive additional port connectivity, the Kensington or StarTech picks likely deliver better value, but if you also want the most comprehensive total port count, the CalDigit's higher price is justified." },
  { "q": "Do I need an adapter to connect my monitors to the iVANKY dock?", "a": "The iVANKY listing specifically notes that if your monitor lacks a Type-C port, you'll need a Type-C to DisplayPort or HDMI adapter, so checking your monitor's actual input type before buying avoids an unexpected extra purchase." },
  { "q": "Can I mix monitor types, like one HDMI and one USB-C display, on these docks?", "a": "The StarTech pick specifically supports HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C video outputs independently and simultaneously, making it the strongest choice in this comparison for a genuinely mixed-monitor setup." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my MacBook Pro's exact chip will unlock triple or quad display support?", "a": "Checking a dock's specifically stated per-chip display documentation, like the StarTech or iVANKY breakdowns by exact M-series chip tier, against your own Mac's chip generation is the most reliable way to confirm real achievable display support." }
