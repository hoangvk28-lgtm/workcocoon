export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "How many concurrent users can a small business NAS handle on gigabit Ethernet?",
    a: "A standard 1GbE connection works fine for document-heavy work with under 5 simultaneous users, but throughput per person drops noticeably once more people are transferring large files at the same time. Upgrading to 2.5GbE or 10GbE, on both the NAS and a matching switch, multiplies per-user throughput for larger or media-heavy teams.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need Active Directory integration for a small business NAS?",
    a: "Most small businesses eventually migrate from individual NAS logins to centralized directory sync as the team grows past roughly 5 users. It's genuinely useful for managing accounts at scale, but the setup is complex enough that it usually needs IT help to configure correctly the first time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the NAS itself need to be backed up?",
    a: "Yes. Most guidance treats a NAS only as a backup destination for computers, but ransomware attacks specifically targeting NAS devices are increasing. Set up cloud backup integration for the NAS's own data so a ransomware event or hardware failure doesn't destroy the only copy of your business files.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I really need a UPS for a business NAS?",
    a: "Yes, treat it as a required companion purchase. A power outage that hits mid-write can corrupt a RAID array, and a USB-connected UPS lets the NAS detect the outage and shut down safely before that happens.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between Value-tier and Plus-tier NAS warranties?",
    a: "Value-tier models, like the Synology DS225+ or DS423 in this list, carry a shorter warranty with no enterprise support option. Plus-tier models, like the DS925+ or DS725+, offer longer coverage and an enterprise support add-on, worth the price step up for business-critical data.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should a small business start with a 2-bay or 4-bay NAS?",
    a: "If the team is small and unlikely to grow much, a 2-bay unit like the UGREEN DXP2800 covers the basics affordably. If growth is likely, either start with an expandable 2-bay unit like the Synology DS725+ or go straight to a 4-bay model like the DS925+ or UGREEN DXP4800 Plus to avoid a second purchase within a year or two.",
