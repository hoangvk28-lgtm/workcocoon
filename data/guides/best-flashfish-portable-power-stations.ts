    description: "This 151Wh (40,800mAh) station delivers reliable power for outdoor, home backup, travel, camping, and long road trips through a 110V AC outlet (200W), dual DC ports, dual QC3.0 USB, and one auto-sensing USB port. At just 4.07 lbs with a soft handle, it's genuinely easy to store in a backpack or car.\n\nA user-friendly LCD display with separate AC/DC control buttons simplifies operation, clearly showing remaining power and charge status even in low-light camping conditions. Three recharge paths (wall AC adapter in 4-4.5 hours, car charger in 5 hours, or Flashfish's compatible 60W solar panel sold separately in 5-6 hours) give genuine flexibility, backed by a BMS with voltage control and short-circuit protection plus a 12-month warranty.",

    description: "This 400Wh (109,200mAh) station steps up from Flashfish's smaller models with a genuine 400W AC output (800W surge) across 9 total ports including an AC outlet, 3 USB ports, a USB-C port, 3 DC ports, and a car port. It's documented as an ideal solution to power electric grills, coffee makers, and similar appliances that smaller stations can't handle.\n\nAt roughly 8.44 lbs with dimensions of 9.2x5.8x6.0 inches, this stays light enough to carry with one hand despite the capacity increase, with an integrated carry handle for moving between rooms during outages. Three charging methods (AC wall, Flashfish's 100W solar panel sold separately, or car outlet) reach a full charge in 9-10 hours, and a built-in BMS protects against overcurrent, overvoltage, and over-temperature for genuinely clean, quiet, fumeless outdoor power.",
    specs: ["400Wh, 400W (800W surge), 8.44 lbs","9 total ports, one-hand carry","9-10hr full charge"],
    pros: ["400W output genuinely runs appliances like electric grills and coffee makers","8.44 lbs stays one-hand carryable despite the larger 400Wh capacity","9 total ports covers a genuinely wide range of device types"],
    cons: ["100W solar panel for outdoor charging is sold separately","9-10 hour full charge is slower than fast-charge-focused rivals"],

    "q": "Does buying flashfish guarantee the same battery chemistry across every model?",
    "a": "No. A brand's lineup can span different battery chemistries and generations, so verify the exact model's documented chemistry and cycle-life rather than assuming brand consistency."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?",
    "a": "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a surge or peak wattage rating mean the station can run appliances at that power level?",
    "a": "No. Surge or peak ratings describe a brief burst the inverter can handle, typically for a compressor or motor startup, not a sustained output level. Always check the continuous or rated wattage figure for what the station can actually run for extended periods."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety."
