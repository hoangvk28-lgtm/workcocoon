    q: "Does a hutch reduce usable desk space?",
    a: "Yes. A hutch occupies the rear 10-12 inches of desk depth. On a standard 24\" deep desk, effective working surface is reduced from 24\" to approximately 12-14\". Monitor arms help recover surface depth by lifting the screen off the back edge.",

    q: "What is the difference between an open-shelf hutch and a closed-cabinet hutch?",
    a: "Open-shelf hutches (SEDETA farmhouse style) let light through to the desk surface and give easy access to stored items. Closed-cabinet hutches (Bush Home Salinas, Sauder Palladia) hide clutter behind doors but create a shadow zone on the desk surface below. Choose open shelf for better lighting; closed cabinet for cleaner appearance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Bush Home hutch desks solid wood?",
    a: "No. Bush Home hutch desks use engineered wood (MDF or particle board) with a laminate surface. This is standard for desk brands in the $200-$700 range. Bush Home's advantage over Sauder is construction quality within the engineered wood category.",
  },
  {
    q: "What monitor size works with a hutch desk?",
    a: "Monitors 24\" and under typically clear most hutch bottoms without conflict. 27\" monitors sit very close to the hutch's lower shelf - measure hutch height clearance before ordering. 32\" and larger monitors almost always need a monitor arm to position the screen far enough forward to clear the hutch frame.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I add a hutch to a desk that did not come with one?",
    a: "Only if the desk is specifically designed for a matching hutch - mounting brackets must align with the desk surface edge. Hutches from different brands or lines are almost never interchangeable. The Bush Cabot and Sauder Palladia lines both have matching hutch accessories available, but verify compatibility before ordering separately.",
