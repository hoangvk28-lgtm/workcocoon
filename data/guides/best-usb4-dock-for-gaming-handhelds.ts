export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Charging Wattage Must Match Your Specific Handheld's Named Performance Mode, Not Just a Generic Wattage Figure",
    "explanation": "The JSAUX pick specifically states it fully supports ROG Ally and Ally X's 30W Turbo Mode and ROG Xbox Ally's 25W and 35W Turbo Modes by name, meaning the dock's charging circuit was validated against those exact performance profiles rather than just claiming a generic '100W charging' figure that might not sustain the handheld's actual peak power draw during demanding games. This matters directly if you regularly use your handheld's highest performance mode for graphically intensive titles, where undersized charging can cause the battery to drain even while connected, and matters less if you typically play in a lower, more power-efficient mode. Check whether a dock's listing specifically names your exact handheld model and performance mode rather than assuming any dock claiming sufficient wattage will sustain your device's peak power draw."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "HDMI 2.1 Unlocks Meaningfully Higher Refresh Rates Than HDMI 2.0 for TV Gaming",
    "explanation": "The BenQ GR10's HDMI 2.1 port specifically supports up to 4K@120Hz or 1080p@360Hz, while the Razer and JSAUX picks' HDMI 2.0 ports cap out at lower refresh rates, a real difference that matters if you're connecting to a high-refresh-rate gaming TV or monitor and want to actually use its full refresh capability. This matters significantly for competitive or fast-paced games where smooth, high-refresh gameplay is noticeable, and matters less if you're connecting to a standard 60Hz television. Check the specific HDMI version (2.0 versus 2.1) stated in a dock's listing rather than assuming any HDMI port supports the same maximum refresh rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Sacrificial Type-C Adapter Protects Your Handheld's Original Port From Repeated Docking Wear",
    "explanation": "The Dual RGB Fans dock specifically includes a sacrificial Type-C adapter designed to absorb the physical wear from repeated plugging and unplugging, protecting your handheld's built-in USB-C port, which is typically expensive or difficult to repair if it wears out or breaks, from taking that wear directly. This matters if you dock and undock your handheld frequently, where repeated connector stress is a real long-term risk to the device's built-in port, and matters less if you rarely undock the device once connected. Check whether a dock includes this kind of protective sacrificial connector if you plan to dock and undock your handheld frequently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Active Fan Cooling Prevents Thermal Throttling During Extended High-Intensity Gaming Sessions",
    "explanation": "The Dual RGB Fans dock's two 5cm diameter cooling fans, specifically larger than the standard 2cm fans on competing docks, deliver more airflow to prevent thermal throttling, a real performance issue where a handheld reduces its own clock speed to manage heat during sustained demanding gameplay. This matters if you play graphically intensive games for extended sessions where heat buildup is a genuine concern, and matters less for shorter or less demanding gaming sessions where thermal throttling rarely becomes an issue. Check whether a dock includes active fan cooling versus relying purely on passive heat dissipation if your typical gaming sessions are long and graphically demanding."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Not Every Dock Supports Every Handheld, Including Explicit Nintendo Switch Exclusions",
    "explanation": "The JSAUX pick specifically states it is not compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, while the Dual RGB Fans dock specifically discloses Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 compatibility but notes that data ports are limited by Nintendo's own manufacturer design, meaning even 'compatible' docks may have functional limitations specific to certain handhelds. This matters directly based on which specific handheld you own, where assuming universal compatibility across all gaming handhelds could lead to a purchase that doesn't fully work with your device. Check a dock's specific stated compatibility list for your exact handheld model and generation before assuming broad handheld dock compatibility applies universally."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the JSAUX dock fully charge my ROG Ally X while gaming in Turbo Mode?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically states full support for the ROG Ally and Ally X's 30W Turbo Mode, though using the manufacturer-recommended 100W charger is necessary to unlock this maximum performance potential." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a gaming handheld dock?", "a": "Buying based on port count or price alone without confirming the dock's charging wattage actually matches their specific handheld's named performance or Turbo Mode, then experiencing battery drain during intensive gaming sessions despite being plugged in." },
  { "q": "Is the BenQ GR10 worth the extra cost over the JSAUX dock if I mainly play on a standard 60Hz TV?", "a": "If your TV is a standard 60Hz display, the JSAUX dock's 4K@60Hz output already matches your TV's capability at a much lower price, making the BenQ's higher HDMI 2.1 refresh rate ceiling less relevant unless you upgrade to a high-refresh-rate display later." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my handheld will fit properly in the Dual RGB Fans dock?", "a": "The listing specifically states your device thickness must be under 27cm for a proper fit, so checking your specific handheld's dimensions against this stated limit before purchase is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Can I use these docks with a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?", "a": "Compatibility varies by pick: the JSAUX dock explicitly excludes the Nintendo Switch 2, while the Dual RGB Fans dock supports both Switch 1 and 2 for video output, though data ports are limited by Nintendo's own manufacturer design on Switch models." },
  { "q": "Do I need a separate power adapter for these docks, or is one included?", "a": "Checking each specific listing's included accessories is worth doing, since several of these docks recommend or require a separately purchased 100W USB-C power adapter to achieve their stated maximum charging and performance capability." }
