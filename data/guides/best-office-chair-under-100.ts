For dorm-specific setups, the Amazon Basics Office Task Chair fits better in tight spaces with reliable build quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a $100 office chair worth it vs a cheaper option?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the most ergonomic office chair under $100?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can an office chair under $100 support good posture?",
    answer: "Partially. A chair with adjustable lumbar support helps maintain the lower back's natural curve. But posture depends on desk height, monitor position, and sitting habits as much as the chair. Pair the chair with a proper desk setup for best results.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I look for in a budget office chair for a dorm?",
    answer: "Compact dimensions (fits under standard dorm desks), flip-up or removable armrests (allows the chair to slide fully under), and a lightweight design (easy to move in a small room). The Amazon Basics Office Task Chair covers the compact and reliable requirements. Flysky's flip-up arms are the best for desk clearance.",
