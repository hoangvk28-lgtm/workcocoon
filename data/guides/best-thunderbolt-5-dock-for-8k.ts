export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Native HDMI 2.1 Output Reaches 8K Without the Adapter Some USB-C-Only Docks Require",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick specifically states its Dual HDMI 2.1 ports deliver up to 8K@60Hz with no adapters needed, distinct from a dock that only outputs 8K through a USB-C or DisplayPort connection requiring a separate adapter to reach an HDMI-only monitor. This matters if your 8K display specifically has an HDMI 2.1 input, since a native port avoids the extra cost, potential bandwidth bottleneck, and possible compatibility issues of relying on an adapter. Check whether a dock's 8K output comes through a native port matching your monitor's actual input type, or whether you'll need to budget for and troubleshoot an additional adapter."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's 8K Support May Explicitly Exclude Certain Host Types Rather Than Working Universally",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick specifically excludes Thunderbolt 3, USB-C-only, and Windows ARM hosts entirely from its documented compatibility, along with gaming laptops that use a DisplayPort MUX, a level of specific exclusion detail that helps prevent a real compatibility mismatch after purchase. This matters significantly if your laptop falls into any of these excluded categories, since no amount of correct cabling or settings will make an explicitly unsupported host work with the dock's 8K feature. Read a dock's full compatibility disclosure for specifically excluded host types, not just its list of supported ones, before assuming your exact laptop will work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Windows and macOS Frequently Reach Different Real 8K Display Counts on the Identical Dock Hardware",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit TS5 Plus pick specifically states Windows Thunderbolt 5 hosts can reach dual 8K@60Hz, while Thunderbolt 4 Windows hosts on the same dock drop to dual 6K@60Hz, and Mac support depends on whether your specific Mac model supports those resolutions at all. This matters if you're specifically buying a dock to maximize 8K display support and use either an older Thunderbolt 4 host or a Mac model that doesn't natively support 8K output. Check a dock's platform-specific and generation-specific display specs for your actual host device, not just its single best-case headline 8K claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Storage Expansion Alongside 8K Display Support Can Consolidate a Color-Critical Workflow",
    "explanation": "The Sonnet Echo 21 pick's built-in M.2 NVMe SSD slot, supporting drives up to 8TB, sits alongside its 8K HDMI output in a single device, letting a video editing or photography workflow run both a high-resolution display and fast local storage without a separate external enclosure taking up another port or desk space. This matters if you're running a color-critical or media-heavy workflow that benefits from both features simultaneously, and matters less if you don't need onboard storage expansion at all. Check whether a dock combines the specific features your actual workflow needs (8K output, fast storage, extensive I/O) rather than assembling multiple single-purpose devices separately."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Purpose-Built Laptop-Specific Dock Trades General Flexibility for a More Complete Out-of-Box 8K Package",
    "explanation": "The Brydge ProDock Trio pick is specifically built only for MacBook Pro 16-inch models, shipping with a precision-fit sleeve, a vertical stand, and a Thunderbolt 5 cable included in the box, a more complete package than a standalone universal dock that ships with just the dock itself and requires you to source your own cable and stand. This matters if you own the exact laptop model a dock is purpose-built for and want the extras included, and matters less if you might switch laptop brands or need a dock that works across different devices. Weigh a purpose-built dock's included accessories and tailored 8K compatibility against a universal dock's broader future flexibility before deciding."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a special HDMI cable to get 8K output from these docks?", "a": "The Plugable pick specifically states its native HDMI 2.1 ports need no adapters, but you should still verify your HDMI cable is rated for HDMI 2.1 bandwidth, since an older or lower-spec cable can bottleneck 8K signal even with a compatible port." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when shopping for an 8K Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming any Thunderbolt 5 dock will output 8K on any host device, when several docks specifically exclude certain host types (like Thunderbolt 3, USB-C-only, or Windows ARM) or require a specific Mac chip generation to reach that resolution at all." },
  { "q": "Is the CalDigit TS5 Plus worth the price over the Plugable dock if I only need single 8K support?", "a": "If you only need a single 8K display without extensive additional port connectivity, the Plugable pick's lower price and native adapter-free HDMI 2.1 output likely deliver better value, but if you want dual 8K on Windows with maximum ports, the CalDigit's higher price is justified." },
  { "q": "Will my Thunderbolt 4 laptop still get 8K output through these docks?", "a": "Support varies significantly by dock; the CalDigit TS5 Plus specifically states Thunderbolt 4 Windows hosts are limited to dual 6K@60Hz rather than the full 8K available on Thunderbolt 5, so checking each dock's Thunderbolt-generation-specific display limits is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Can I run 8K and fast external storage from the same dock without extra boxes?", "a": "Yes, the Sonnet Echo 21 specifically combines a built-in M.2 NVMe SSD slot with 8K HDMI output in one device, letting you run both without a separate external storage enclosure." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my exact MacBook Pro chip supports dual 8K on the Brydge dock?", "a": "The Brydge listing specifically states display count and refresh rate depend on your exact MacBook chip and Apple's own display limits, so checking your chip generation against Apple's published display specifications before buying is the reliable way to confirm real support." }
