export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 4-Port Extender's Total Power Budget Is Shared Across All Ports, Not Independently Allocated to Each",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically states a 90W BT input splitting into an 80W total output budget across its 4 ports, meaning the combined draw of all connected devices must stay within that shared budget rather than each port independently supporting its own maximum rating simultaneously. This matters significantly if you're connecting four devices that each draw close to the port's maximum rated wattage, since the total combined draw could exceed what the extender's shared power budget can actually deliver. Check a 4-port extender's total output budget against the combined wattage of all devices you plan to connect simultaneously, not just each port's individual maximum rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Hardware PoE Chipset With PD Detection Provides More Reliable Device Protection Than Software-Emulated PoE",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically states it uses a hardware IEEE 802.3af/at/bt chipset following a PD Detection, Classification Type, and Power On sequence, a more rigorous device-safety procedure than some cheaper extenders that use software-emulated PoE detection, which can be less reliable at correctly identifying and safely powering connected devices. This matters if you're connecting expensive or sensitive PoE equipment where an incorrect power delivery could cause damage, and matters less for inexpensive, replaceable devices where the risk tolerance is lower. Check whether a listing specifically names a hardware-based PoE detection chipset if protecting valuable connected equipment is a priority."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An IP40 Industrial Enclosure Rating Is Different From, and Generally Lower Than, an Outdoor IP65/67 Waterproof Rating",
    "explanation": "The Industrial pick's specifically stated IP40 rating protects against solid objects larger than 1mm but provides no specific water protection, a genuinely different (and in water-resistance terms, lower) standard than the VIMIN pick's IP65 rating, even though both are marketed toward demanding environments. This matters if your installation location has actual moisture or water exposure, where an IP40-rated unit would need additional protection despite its 'industrial' branding, and matters less in a dry industrial setting with only temperature and dust concerns. Check the specific IP rating number, not just the word 'industrial' or 'rugged' in a product's marketing, if water exposure is a real factor in your installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "6KV Surge Protection Is a Concrete, Checkable Specification Worth Comparing Directly Across Similarly Marketed Extenders",
    "explanation": "Both the LINOVISION and Industrial picks specifically state 6KV surge protection, a concrete rating that quantifies how much transient voltage spike the unit can absorb, distinct from a vague 'built-in protection' claim on a competing extender that doesn't specify an actual voltage rating. This matters if you're installing in a location with real electrical surge risk from storms or unstable power infrastructure, and matters less in a stable, surge-protected environment already served by a quality UPS or surge suppressor upstream. Compare the specific stated surge protection voltage rating across extenders, rather than assuming any 'protected' claim provides the same level of safeguarding."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Lifetime Technical Support Commitment Provides More Ongoing Value Than a Standard Warranty Alone for a Multi-Device Extender",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's specifically stated lifetime 24/7 US local and global technical support goes beyond a standard 1-year warranty period, offering ongoing troubleshooting help for a device that, once installed powering four separate connected devices, becomes more central to your network's reliability than a single-port extender. This matters if you want assurance of ongoing help diagnosing issues across a more complex multi-device setup, and matters less if you're comfortable troubleshooting connectivity issues independently. Check whether a 4-port extender's listing specifically names an ongoing support commitment beyond just its warranty period, if remote troubleshooting help matters for your installation's complexity."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I power four devices at their maximum wattage simultaneously on a 4-port PoE extender?", "a": "Not necessarily; the total power budget is typically shared across all ports, so the LINOVISION pick's 80W total budget across 4 ports means the combined draw of all connected devices must stay within that shared limit, not each device drawing its individual maximum simultaneously." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 4-port PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming each port's individual maximum wattage rating is available simultaneously and independently, when the total power budget is typically shared across all ports on the same extender unit." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION extender worth the higher price over the MokerLink pick?", "a": "If you need hardware-based PoE chip safety, surge protection, and lifetime technical support, the LINOVISION's higher price is justified, but for a basic indoor installation without those specific needs, the MokerLink pick's much lower price delivers solid core functionality." },
  { "q": "Is an IP40 rating good enough for an outdoor 4-port PoE extender installation?", "a": "IP40 provides no specific water resistance rating, so for a genuinely outdoor or moisture-exposed installation, an IP65 or higher rated extender like the VIMIN pick is a better fit than an IP40-rated industrial unit despite its rugged marketing." },
  { "q": "Do I need surge protection for a 4-port PoE extender in a typical home network closet?", "a": "Surge protection matters more if your area experiences frequent storms or unstable power, or if you're protecting valuable connected equipment; for a typical stable home setup, it's a valuable but not strictly necessary feature." },
  { "q": "Can I cascade multiple 4-port PoE extenders together to cover a larger installation?", "a": "Yes, several picks in this comparison, including the Industrial and MokerLink extenders, specifically support 3-level cascading, letting you chain multiple units together to extend coverage across a larger installation area." }
