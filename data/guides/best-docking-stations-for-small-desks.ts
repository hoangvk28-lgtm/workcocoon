export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Is a bus-powered dock enough for a small desk setup?",
    a: "A bus-powered dock is enough if you don't need to charge your laptop through it and your peripheral load is modest, a mouse, keyboard, and one or two monitors. If you need the dock to also charge the laptop at 85-100W, look for a model with that PD rating specified, since not all bus-powered docks pass through laptop charging.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do compact docks support the same number of monitors as full-size docks?",
    a: "Some do. The Acer 11-in-1 and Anker Nano 13-in-1 in this list both support 3 monitors despite being genuinely compact, though running 3 displays splits the dock's total bandwidth between them. If you only need 1-2 monitors, a smaller dock like the UGREEN 7-in-1 will have more headroom for data transfer.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much desk space does an AC-powered compact dock actually need?",
    a: "Add the power brick's footprint to the dock's own dimensions. The TobenONE's included 150W adapter, for example, takes up meaningful space on its own, sometimes more than the dock body itself. If desk space is extremely tight, a bus-powered dock with no brick, like the UGREEN 7-in-1, saves more real estate even at a lower PD rating.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my compact dock get warm during long work sessions?",
    a: "Most compact docks use passive cooling with no internal fan, so the case itself dissipates heat. Placing the dock in a tight cable channel, under papers, or in an enclosed drawer restricts airflow and can cause the dock to run hotter, occasionally leading to USB disconnects. Leave a few inches of open space around a passively cooled dock during heavy use.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a 'docking station' and a simple USB-C hub at this size?",
    a: "At the compact end, the line blurs, but a true dock typically includes Ethernet and higher-wattage PD passthrough, while a basic hub focuses on just display and data ports. All the picks in this list function as full docking stations, but always confirm PD wattage and Ethernet inclusion if those matter to your setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mount a compact dock under my desk to save surface space entirely?",
    a: "Yes, for models with a separate (not permanently attached) cable, you can mount the dock under the desk with adhesive strips or a small tray, keeping only the cable end accessible on the desktop. Attached-cable models with a short 20-30cm cable usually can't reach far enough under the desk to make this practical.",
