    q: "Will the boom arm included in a budget kit hold up over time?",
    a: "It's usually the weakest link. Bundled boom arms in lower-priced kits often have less-calibrated spring tension and can gradually droop during a long session. If you record for extended periods regularly, a standalone arm like the InnoGear pick in this list, bought separately, typically holds tension better.",
  },
  {
    q: "How far should I position a USB microphone from my mouth?",
    a: "Start with the capsule 6-8 inches away, angled about 45 degrees off-axis rather than pointed straight on. This reduces plosives and sibilance and is standard advice that most kit listings don't include, despite being one of the most useful things a first-time buyer can know.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I swap just the mic or just the boom arm later?",
    a: "In most cases yes, if the thread sizes match. Mic and arm mounts commonly use either 5/8\" or 3/8\" threads. The InnoGear boom arm in this list explicitly covers both sizes, which makes it a safe upgrade or replacement arm for most kit mics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a bundled boom arm's clamp fit my desk?",
    a: "Standard clamps typically fit desks up to roughly 5cm thick. Solid wood or thicker composite desks can exceed this, so check the clamp's rated thickness range against your actual desk before ordering, especially with a heavier-built desk.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it cheaper to buy a kit or piece together mic and arm separately?",
    a: "A genuine all-in-one kit like the FIFINE A6T at $49.99 is usually cheaper than buying a comparable mic and arm separately. But if you already own one piece, like a mic on a desktop stand, buying just the missing piece, such as the $18.99 InnoGear arm, costs less than replacing the whole setup.",
