    q: "What is a lateral file cabinet?",
    a: "A lateral file cabinet is wider than it is tall. Drawers pull out from the long side of the cabinet and hold files front-to-back with tabs facing upward. Lateral cabinets are lower-profile than vertical cabinets, provide a wider flat top surface for printers or decor, and suit rooms where wall width is available but height clearance is limited.",

If you need integrated charging, the Halitaa at $139.99 with 4.5 stars is excellent for a desk-adjacent setup. For a design-forward mid-century look, the T4TREAM Fluted Oak stands apart visually.",

    q: "Can a lateral file cabinet hold a printer on top?",
    a: "Yes, for most picks in this list. The wide flat top surface of a lateral cabinet typically has enough space for a standard home office inkjet or laser printer. The T4TREAM is explicitly marketed for large tabletop use. Verify the specific weight capacity on the product listing before placing a heavy laser printer.",

    q: "Are these lateral file cabinets solid wood?",
    a: "Based on listing data, none of the products in this roundup are verified as solid hardwood. They use engineered wood cores with realistic wood-look laminate or veneer finishes. The Martin Furniture Oxford at $499 may use higher-quality materials but this should be confirmed on the current Amazon listing.",

    a: "Letter size paper is 8.5 by 11 inches. Legal size paper is 8.5 by 14 inches. Most lateral cabinets in this list accommodate letter size files by default. If you regularly work with legal documents or contracts, verify the specific listing for letter-and-legal compatibility before ordering.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much wall space does a lateral file cabinet need?",
    a: "Most lateral cabinets in this list are 30 to 36 inches wide. Add a few inches of clearance on each side for comfortable drawer opening. Plan for at least 34 to 40 inches of wall width to use a lateral cabinet comfortably.",
