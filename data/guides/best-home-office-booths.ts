export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual acoustic performance, not just the word \"soundproof\"",
    "explanation": "\"Soundproof\" is a marketing term with no fixed technical meaning, while a genuine sound-dampening spec is usually expressed as an STC (Sound Transmission Class) or dB reduction rating, and many pod listings use the word freely without disclosing any such figure at all.\n\nThis matters directly if the pod's purpose is blocking distracting noise for calls or focused work, since a pod with acoustic panels but no verified STC rating may reduce noise only modestly rather than genuinely isolating sound.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated STC rating or dB reduction figure, and treat the bare word \"soundproof\" with no supporting number as an unverified marketing claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check ventilation claims against real airflow data, not just the word \"ventilated\"",
    "explanation": "An enclosed pod needs active air circulation to stay comfortable during extended use, and a listing that mentions \"ventilation\" or \"silent airflow\" without stating a CFM (cubic feet per minute) figure or fan specification is making an unverifiable claim, since the word alone doesn't confirm the pod actually moves enough air to prevent it from feeling stuffy after 20-30 minutes of occupied use.\n\nThis matters more the longer you'll realistically sit inside the pod at a stretch, and less for very short, occasional use.\n\nCheck the listing for a specific fan CFM rating or described ventilation system, not just the presence of the word \"ventilation\" in the feature list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm actual exterior and interior dimensions against your specific space",
    "explanation": "Office pod listings vary widely in how precisely they disclose dimensions, some state an exact exterior footprint in inches, others describe size only in vague relative terms like \"compact\" or \"small\", and the difference between exterior footprint and usable interior space can be substantial once wall thickness and acoustic panel depth are accounted for.\n\nThis matters directly for fitting a pod into a specific room or corner, measuring your actual available space against a vague size description is guesswork.\n\nCheck the listing for exact exterior dimensions in inches, and if not stated, contact the seller directly for measurements before assuming any pod described as \"small\" or \"compact\" will fit your space."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Factor in delivery, assembly, and floor-loading requirements before buying",
    "explanation": "Most office pods are heavy, large structures shipped via freight delivery rather than standard parcel shipping, requiring a clear delivery path, assembly time (sometimes requiring more than one person or professional installation), and genuine floor-loading consideration, especially for an upper-floor apartment or a building with older flooring.\n\nThis matters a great deal because these logistics are easy to overlook when comparing pods purely on price and features, but can turn into a real problem on delivery day if the pod can't physically reach its intended spot or the floor isn't rated to support its weight.\n\nCheck the listing for stated weight, whether professional installation is included or required, and confirm your specific building's floor-loading capacity and delivery access before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh mobility features like wheels against the pod's actual weight and your real need to relocate it",
    "explanation": "Wheels or casters make repositioning a pod within a room more realistic, but they don't change the fundamental reality that these are heavy, large structures, wheels ease movement across a flat floor but don't substitute for verifying weight limits or making the pod meaningfully portable between rooms or floors.\n\nThis distinction matters if you expect to actually relocate the pod periodically versus placing it once and leaving it in position long-term, a pod marketed as \"portable\" still generally requires real effort and often more than one person to move safely.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world mentions of repositioning the pod after initial setup, not just the presence of wheels in the spec list."
