  {
    "criterion": "A Compact Dock's Real Port Count Varies Far More Than Its Physical Size Alone Suggests",
    "explanation": "The picks in this comparison range from the OWC hub's minimal 5 ports to the Cable Matters dock's 11-in-1 design, showing that 'compact' doesn't map to a single fixed port count the way it might for a physical size category like a laptop screen size. This matters if you need a specific number of simultaneous ports (Ethernet, card readers, multiple USB-A) in a smaller form factor, since assuming any compact dock covers your needs could leave you short on a port you actually require. Read a compact dock's specific port list rather than assuming its smaller size means a smaller but still complete set of the ports a full-size dock would offer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In PCIe Expansion Slots Can Support More Than Just Storage, Adding Real Future Flexibility",
    "explanation": "The HyperDrive Next pick specifically states its M.2 PCIe Gen 4x4 and Gen 3 slot supports both high-capacity NVMe SSDs and compatible PCIe-based modules like AI accelerators, a genuinely more flexible expansion path than a storage-only NVMe bay that can only ever hold a drive. This matters if you anticipate wanting to add specialized PCIe hardware beyond simple storage down the line, and matters less if you only ever plan to use the slot for a standard SSD. Check whether a dock's expansion slot is described as storage-only or as a more flexible PCIe slot supporting other module types, if future hardware flexibility matters to your workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Offline Charging Lets a Compact Dock Double as a Standalone Charging Station Without a Connected Host",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit E5 pick's specifically named Offline Charging feature keeps connected devices charging even when the hub itself isn't plugged into a host computer, a genuinely useful capability for a compact dock you might want to use as a bedside or travel charging hub rather than only at your primary desk. This matters if you plan to move the dock between locations or want it to double as a general charging station, and matters less if it will permanently stay connected to one computer. Look for a dock that specifically names an offline or host-independent charging capability if you want that added flexibility beyond its primary docking function."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless Cooling in a Compact Chassis Trades Silent Operation for Potentially Less Sustained Thermal Headroom",
    "explanation": "The OWC hub's fanless aluminum enclosure keeps operation silent with no moving parts, a real benefit in a compact device likely to sit close to where you're working or sleeping, though a smaller fanless chassis generally has less surface area and airflow to dissipate heat than a larger actively-cooled dock under sustained heavy load. This matters if you value quiet operation in a small space and don't run the dock at maximum sustained load for extended periods, and matters less if you're running demanding, continuous multi-display or storage workloads. Weigh a compact fanless design's silent operation against a larger dock's potentially greater sustained thermal headroom based on your actual real-world usage pattern."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Physical Security Lock Slots Matter More for a Compact Dock Left in a Shared or Unattended Space",
    "explanation": "The HyperDrive Next pick specifically includes both Nano and Standard security lock slots, letting you physically secure the dock to a desk in a shared office or coworking environment where a smaller, more portable compact dock might otherwise be an easier target for casual theft than a larger, more awkward-to-carry full-size dock. This matters if you're deploying the dock in a space you don't fully control or where it might sit unattended, and matters less for a dock that stays in a private home office. Check whether a compact dock includes a physical lock slot if you plan to use it anywhere outside a fully private, controlled space."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does a compact Thunderbolt 5 dock always mean fewer ports than a full-size one?", "a": "Generally yes, though the reduction varies significantly: the Cable Matters pick still packs 11 ports into a compact design, while the OWC hub deliberately strips down to just 5 essential ports for the smallest possible footprint." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a compact Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming a smaller dock automatically sacrifices power delivery or performance, when several compact docks in this comparison specifically maintain full 140W charging and strong sustained power delivery despite their reduced size." },
  { "q": "Is the HyperDrive Next worth the higher price over the OWC hub if I just need basic docking?", "a": "If you don't need PCIe module expansion or physical security lock slots, the OWC hub's much lower price and genuinely smaller footprint make it the better fit for basic docking needs." },
  { "q": "Can I use the CalDigit E5's Offline Charging feature to charge my phone away from my desk?", "a": "Yes, the CalDigit E5 specifically supports Offline Charging that keeps connected devices powered even when the hub isn't connected to a host computer, making it useful as a standalone charging station when moved elsewhere." },
  { "q": "Do I need a genuine Thunderbolt 5 laptop to use any of these compact docks?", "a": "Full 80Gb/s or higher bandwidth and the highest advertised display configurations specifically require a genuine Thunderbolt 5 host, though most of these docks will still function at reduced capability with Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 hosts." },
  { "q": "Which of these compact docks is best for a small desk with very limited space?", "a": "The OWC Thunderbolt 5 Hub's 3-inch by 6-inch by 1-inch footprint is the smallest in this comparison, making it the strongest choice specifically for the tightest desk spaces." }
