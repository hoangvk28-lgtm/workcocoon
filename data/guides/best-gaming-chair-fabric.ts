export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

  {
    q: "Is a fabric gaming chair better than PU leather?",
    a: "Fabric chairs, like the GTPLAYER mesh and Leatheraire models in this guide, generally breathe better and don't get as hot or sticky during long sessions compared to PU leather. Leather is easier to wipe clean, so the better choice depends on whether breathability or easy cleaning matters more to you.",

  {
    q: "What's the most breathable fabric gaming chair?",
    a: "The GTPLAYER mesh chair and Dowinx's self-developed mesh chair are both rated at roughly 2x the breathability of standard fabric. The Dowinx Gel Pad model goes further by adding a removable cooling gel pad on top of its breathable fabric for active cooling.",

  {
    q: "Are big and tall fabric gaming chairs available?",
    a: "Yes. The GTPLAYER Big & Tall model is rated for 350 lbs with a flannel fabric finish, and the Dowinx Big & Tall Suede model goes further at 440 lbs with an extra-wide 21.5-inch seat and premium microsuede fabric, the highest capacity in this guide.",

  {
    q: "Is the Secretlab Titan Evo worth the price over budget fabric chairs?",
    a: "The Titan Evo's SoftWeave fabric, 4D armrests, and 4-way lumbar system are a different tier of build quality compared to the $90 to $180 GTPLAYER and Dowinx chairs in this guide, but at $689 it costs several times more. It's worth it for daily, multi-hour use where adjustability and long-term durability matter most; for occasional gaming, the budget mesh options deliver similar comfort for a fraction of the cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do fabric gaming chairs come in unique colors or textures?",
    a: "Yes. The Ferghana chair uses velvet fabric with a fire embroidery design for a distinct look, and the Dowinx Big & Tall Suede comes in green microsuede, both standing apart from the more common black mesh finishes used by most GTPLAYER and other Dowinx models in this guide.",
