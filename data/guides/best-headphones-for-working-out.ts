  {
    q: "What IP rating do I actually need for gym use?",
    a: "For light gym training like lifting or yoga: IPX4 is sufficient for sweat and light rain. For running or intense cardio with heavy sweat: IP57 or IP68 is the right target. For swimming or water sports: IPX7 or IP68. The JBL Endurance Peak 3 at IP68 and $59-$79 covers every scenario except dedicated swimming.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use over-ear headphones at the gym?",
    a: "Yes, with conditions. Over-ear headphones are best for low to moderate intensity gym sessions like weight training, stationary bike, and stretching. They are not suitable for running (too unstable), intense cardio (movement shifts them), or heavy sweat training (most lack IP ratings). The Sony WH-1000XM5 is the over-ear pick for its ANC and sound quality, but be realistic about how much you sweat.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are bone conduction headphones worth it?",
    a: "For outdoor runners and cyclists: yes. Open ears are a genuine safety advantage on roads and trails. For gym-only users: no. You pay more for less bass response and less isolation than earbuds at the same price. The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 is the pick for outdoor athletes. Earbuds are the right choice for indoor training.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I make earbuds stay in during workouts?",
    a: "Three factors: ear tip size (try all included sizes, many people use the wrong size), ear wing tips (a silicone wing that braces against the inner ear), and ear hooks (a physical loop over the outer ear). The Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 uses all three simultaneously. The JBL Endurance Peak 3 and Soundcore Sport X10 use hooks. The Jabra earbuds rely on precision fit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between IPX7 and IP68?",
    a: "IPX7 means water resistant to 1 meter submersion for 30 minutes. The X means dust resistance is unrated. IP68 means fully dustproof (rating 6) plus water resistant beyond 1 meter at a manufacturer-specified depth. IP68 is the stronger rating for both dust and water. At sub-$80, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 achieving IP68 is genuinely unusual.",
