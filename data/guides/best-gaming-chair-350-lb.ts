export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity against your actual body weight with real safety margin",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's rated weight capacity is the absolute maximum before the frame, gas lift, and casters are at real risk of failure, not a comfortable operating range, so a chair rated just barely above your actual weight is running much closer to its structural limit than a chair with genuine headroom.\n\nThis matters because a chair operating near its weight limit tends to develop wobble, sagging, or gas-lift failure faster than one with real margin, even if it doesn't fail outright.\n\nCheck the listed weight capacity, and favor a chair rated at least 50-75 lbs above your actual weight rather than one that just barely clears it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify lumbar support is genuinely adjustable, not just a fixed cushion",
    "explanation": "Many gaming chairs include a lumbar cushion or built-in curve marketed as \"ergonomic support,\" but a fixed, non-adjustable lumbar shape only fits correctly for a body proportioned exactly the way the chair was designed for, while a genuinely adjustable lumbar system (height-adjustable, inflatable, or a repositionable pillow) can be tuned to your actual lower back curve.\n\nThis matters directly if you experience real lower back discomfort during long sessions, a fixed lumbar shape that doesn't match your body can be worse than no lumbar support at all.\n\nCheck whether lumbar support is described as adjustable and how (height, firmness, or position), not just whether the word \"lumbar\" appears in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider armrest range of motion for your actual desk height and typing posture",
    "explanation": "Armrest adjustability ranges from simple height-only adjustment to full 4D armrests that move up, down, forward, back, and pivot, and this range matters directly for matching the armrest height to your specific desk and keyboard position, a mismatched armrest height forces shoulders up or wrists at an awkward angle during long sessions.\n\nThis matters more for anyone spending many hours daily typing or gaming, less for occasional use where posture matters less.\n\nCheck the specific armrest adjustment axes listed (2D, 3D, or 4D), not just whether armrests are present, and match that against how much your desk height or seating position varies."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh recline range and locking positions against how you actually use the chair",
    "explanation": "Recline range varies from a modest 90-135 degrees on basic gaming chairs to a near-flat 180 degrees on recliner-style models, and a wider recline range only matters if you'll actually use it, for napping, watching content reclined, or relaxing between gaming sessions, versus sitting upright for focused work or gaming most of the time.\n\nThis matters because a chair with an impressive recline range but a weak recline lock can feel unstable at extreme angles, while a more basic recline range with a solid lock mechanism holds position reliably.\n\nCheck both the maximum recline angle and whether the recline lock holds at multiple positions, not just the maximum angle alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check base material and caster quality for real long-term stability",
    "explanation": "The 5-star base and caster wheels bear the chair's full weight through thousands of rolling and swiveling cycles over the chair's life, and material quality here varies significantly, a genuine steel or reinforced nylon base holds up far better under real weight than a cheaper plastic base that can crack or flex over time, and caster wheel quality affects both smooth rolling and floor protection.\n\nThis matters more for a heavier user or daily long-session use, less for occasional light use.\n\nCheck the listed base material specifically, not just the overall chair material, and check reviews for mentions of base or caster durability after months of use, not just initial assembly quality."

  { q: "Is pocket spring or memory foam better for a 350 lb capacity chair?", a: "Pocket spring, used on the GTPLAYER Pocket Spring picks, SITMOD, and Dowinx, tends to hold its shape longer under sustained heavy loads than flat memory foam like on the GTPLAYER F59GT. Memory foam typically feels plusher initially but can compress more over time." },
  { q: "Do any of these chairs have a documented durability test?", a: "The SITMOD specifies its SGS-rated gas lift was tested for 100,000 cycles, the most specific durability claim in this guide.
