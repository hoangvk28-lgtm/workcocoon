    "criterion": "Dell-Branded Docks Consistently Deliver Meaningfully Less Charging Wattage to Non-Dell Systems",
    "explanation": "Both Dell picks in this comparison specifically state 300W charging capability for Dell systems but only 240W for non-Dell systems, a real and disclosed 60W difference that matters directly if you're considering a Dell dock for use with a non-Dell laptop. This matters significantly if you own a non-Dell Windows laptop and are evaluating these docks based on their headline Dell-specific wattage figures, and matters less if you exclusively use genuine Dell hardware where the full rated wattage applies. Check a Dell-branded dock's specifically disclosed non-Dell system wattage figure before assuming the dock's headline power rating applies equally to your own non-Dell laptop."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Enterprise Fleet Management Platforms Differ Meaningfully in Underlying Technology and Scope",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo pick's Accessories Fleet Manager is specifically cloud-based and powered by AWS, while the Dell SD25TB5 pick's smart management specifically allows firmware updates over Wi-Fi without a connected PC, two genuinely different underlying approaches to remote dock management that could matter depending on your organization's existing IT infrastructure and cloud provider relationships. This matters significantly if you're deploying docks across an organization with specific IT infrastructure requirements or existing cloud platform commitments, and matters much less for a single home or personal desk setup where enterprise fleet management provides no practical benefit. Consider your organization's specific IT management platform and infrastructure before choosing based on enterprise features that only deliver value at deployment scale."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Display Configuration Combinations Vary Significantly Even Among Docks With Similar Thunderbolt 5 Branding",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo pick specifically supports up to three 8K 60Hz displays or four monitors in mixed high-refresh configurations, while the Dell SD25TB5 picks specifically support up to four 4K@120Hz displays or a single 8K@60Hz display, genuinely different maximum display combinations despite all being Thunderbolt 5 docks in a similar price range. This matters directly based on your specific multi-monitor setup goals, where the exact combination of resolution, refresh rate, and display count you need should be checked against each dock's specific stated capabilities rather than assumed from generic Thunderbolt 5 branding. Compare each dock's specifically stated maximum display combinations (not just its Thunderbolt generation) against your exact intended multi-monitor setup before purchasing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PC-to-PC Sharing Software Solves a Genuinely Different Collaboration Need Than Standard Dock Functionality",
    "explanation": "The ASUS DC510's Thunderbolt Share software specifically enables secure PC-to-PC sharing of a screen, keyboard, mouse, and storage between two computers at Thunderbolt speeds, a collaborative capability none of the other three picks in this comparison offer, useful for workflows involving transferring data between an old and new computer or sharing a workstation setup between two machines. This matters if your specific workflow involves regularly sharing resources or transferring large amounts of data between two separate computers, and matters less if you only ever connect one laptop to the dock at a time. Consider whether your specific workflow genuinely benefits from PC-to-PC sharing capability before paying a premium for this specific feature over docks without it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Broader Operating System Compatibility Reduces Risk If Your Laptop Fleet or Personal Setup Spans Multiple Platforms",
    "explanation": "The Dell SD25TB5 Pro 12-Port pick specifically discloses compatibility across Windows 10/11, macOS, ChromeOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu, a notably broader disclosed operating system range than competitors that focus primarily on Windows and macOS. This matters if you or your organization uses a genuinely mixed operating system environment including Linux-based systems, where this dock's explicitly confirmed broader compatibility provides real assurance, and matters less if you exclusively use Windows or macOS where any of these picks would work. Check a dock's specifically disclosed operating system compatibility list if your setup includes less common platforms like Linux distributions, rather than assuming broad Windows/Mac compatibility extends to every OS."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will I get the full 300W charging if I use a Dell Thunderbolt 5 dock with my HP or Lenovo laptop?", "a": "No, both Dell picks in this comparison specifically state 300W charging applies to Dell systems only, with non-Dell systems limited to 240W, so an HP or Lenovo laptop would receive the lower figure." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Thunderbolt 5 dock for Windows?", "a": "Assuming all Thunderbolt 5 docks deliver identical display and charging capabilities based on similar branding, when the exact display combinations, refresh rates, and charging wattage figures vary meaningfully between specific models even within the same brand." },
  { "q": "Is the ASUS DC510 worth its significant price premium over the Dell or Lenovo picks?", "a": "If you specifically need Thunderbolt Share's PC-to-PC sharing capability for creative collaboration or file transfer between computers, the ASUS DC510's premium is justified, but for standard multi-display docking without that specific feature, the Dell or Lenovo picks deliver comparable core functionality for less." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Dell SD25TB5 12-Port dock without the included cable bundle version?", "a": "Yes, the 12-Port pick is a separate, lower-priced listing without the bundled cables that the pricier SD25TB5 bundle includes, so if you already own compatible DisplayPort, HDMI, and Ethernet cables, the 12-Port version saves money." },
  { "q": "Does the Lenovo ThinkPad Thunderbolt 5 dock work with non-Lenovo laptops?", "a": "The dock supports Thunderbolt 5 technology broadly, so it should work with other Thunderbolt 5-equipped laptops, though checking the specific stated charging wattage and display support for non-Lenovo systems in the manufacturer's documentation is worth doing before purchase." },
  { "q": "How do I know which display configuration these docks support with my specific laptop's GPU?", "a": "Checking your laptop's exact Thunderbolt 5 port specifications and GPU capabilities against each dock's stated display combinations is essential, since actual achievable resolution and refresh rate depend on your host laptop's own graphics hardware, not the dock's maximum rating alone." }
