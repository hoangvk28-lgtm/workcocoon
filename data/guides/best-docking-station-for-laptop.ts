    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "What's the difference between a Thunderbolt certified dock and a regular USB-C hub?",
    a: "A Thunderbolt certified dock, like the Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Dock or UGREEN Revodok Max 208, has passed Intel's strict certification testing that guarantees compatibility. A regular USB-C hub, even one that markets itself with Thunderbolt-sounding language, is only compatible on a \"should work\" basis, not a guaranteed one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 100W dock actually charge my laptop at 100W?",
    a: "Usually not quite. Real-world delivered wattage typically runs about 10-15W below a dock's rated spec, since the dock's own circuitry draws some power first. If your laptop needs the full 100W or more under load, like a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a workstation laptop, expect a dock rated at exactly 100W to fall a bit short.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do my dock's connected devices keep randomly disconnecting?",
    a: "This is often USB bus saturation, not a broken dock, caused by heavy simultaneous load like dual 4K displays plus a fast file transfer plus a connected drive. Spreading devices across fewer simultaneous high-bandwidth tasks, avoiding daisy-chained hubs, and checking for a firmware update usually resolves it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a docking station cause input lag for gaming or video editing?",
    a: "It depends on the display technology. DisplayLink-based docks use CPU-based compression to drive extra displays, which can introduce noticeable input lag for gaming or color-accurate video editing. Native Thunderbolt docks, like the Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Dock, drive displays directly from the GPU with no compression lag.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a Thunderbolt dock with an AMD laptop?",
    a: "Some newer AMD laptop chips ship with USB4 rather than true Thunderbolt, so a Thunderbolt-branded dock isn't guaranteed to deliver its full certified feature set on those laptops the way it would on a genuine Thunderbolt or Mac Apple Silicon laptop. Check your specific laptop's port spec before assuming full compatibility.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my dock's cable length matter?",
    a: "Thunderbolt 4 stays reliable with active cables up to about 2 meters, but USB4 connections can degrade past roughly 0.8 meters with a passive cable. A dock placed far from the laptop with a long generic cable is a common, overlooked cause of disconnect complaints that have nothing to do with the dock itself.",
