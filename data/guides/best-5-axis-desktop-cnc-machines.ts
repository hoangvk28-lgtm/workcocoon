export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 5 axis desktop cnc machines genuinely different from a 3-axis machine with a rotary add-on?",
    "a": "Yes, genuinely different. True 5-axis machines control all five axes simultaneously for complex contoured surfaces, while a rotary add-on on a 3-axis base typically only indexes between fixed positions rather than moving simultaneously."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need special CAM software for 5-axis machining?",
    "a": "Generally yes. Standard 3-axis CAM software doesn't generate true 5-axis toolpaths, so confirm your CAM package explicitly supports simultaneous 5-axis output before buying a 5-axis machine."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
