    "title": "Port Count & Speed Tier",
    "description": "Verified the actual port count, Gigabit vs multi-gig speed rating, and whether every port runs at the advertised speed or only some do, since several switches mix full-speed and lower-speed ports."
  },
  {
    "title": "PoE Power Budget",
    "description": "Checked the total PoE wattage budget against realistic device counts, not just the per-port maximum, since a switch's total power pool is what actually limits how many cameras or access points it can run."
  },
  {
    "title": "Management Depth",
    "description": "Classified each switch as unmanaged, smart/easy-managed, or fully managed Layer 2/3, since this determines what troubleshooting and segmentation options are available after installation, not just at setup."

export const howToChoose: HowToChooseSection[] = [
  {
    "subheading": "SFP Module Compatibility Note",
    "note": "SFP and SFP+ transceivers are almost always sold separately from the switch itself, and you'll need to match the module type (copper RJ45, multi-mode fiber, or single-mode fiber) to your specific cable run distance and existing infrastructure before installation."

];

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Port count is a headroom decision, not a current-need one",
    "explanation": "Buy for what you'll plug in over the next 2-3 years, not just today. An 8-port switch that's already full the day it arrives means buying a second switch and daisy-chaining, which adds a hop of latency and another point of failure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE budget is a shared pool, not per-port",
    "explanation": "A switch rated for 8 PoE+ ports at 120W total does not mean every port gets 30W simultaneously. Add up the real draw of every camera, AP, and phone you'll connect, and make sure the total budget clears it with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Managed vs unmanaged changes what you can diagnose later",
    "explanation": "An unmanaged switch is zero-configuration but gives you no visibility when something goes wrong. A smart-managed switch adds VLANs, port mirroring, and traffic monitoring for a modest price increase, worth it the first time you need to isolate a misbehaving device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless does not always mean silent under load",
    "explanation": "Most desktop switches are genuinely fanless and silent, but high-port-count PoE switches sometimes add active cooling once the power budget climbs past 200-300W. Check for a fan explicitly if a quiet office or bedroom install matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speed needs matching cable and network gear",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G or 10G switch only delivers those speeds if your cabling is Cat5e or better (Cat6a for 10G) and the devices on both ends actually support that speed. Mixing a multi-gig switch into an all-Gigabit network gets you nothing extra."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Renewed enterprise gear needs a licensing check first",
    "explanation": "Cisco Meraki, Juniper, and some Aruba/HPE switches on Amazon are frequently sold as renewed hardware without an active license or support contract. Confirm what functions before assuming a discounted enterprise switch works like a new one out of the box."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What's the difference between SFP and SFP+?",
    "a": "SFP typically supports up to 1Gbps, while SFP+ supports up to 10Gbps. Check which your switch's ports actually support, since using the wrong transceiver type in an SFP+ port won't reach full speed even if it physically fits."
