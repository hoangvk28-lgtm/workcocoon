  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Should I wait for a Thunderbolt 5 dock instead of buying TB4 now?",
    a: "In most cases, no. A TB4 dock works fine with a TB5 laptop, running at TB4 speeds since TB5 is backward compatible. The main exception is certain newer MacBook Pro models with a 120Gbps bandwidth boost, which only unlock full throughput through a genuine TB5 dock like the Anker Prime TB5.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a Thunderbolt 4 dock work with my AMD laptop?",
    a: "It will plug in and generally function, since AMD Ryzen 7000 and newer ships with USB4 rather than native TB4. Most features will work, but you lose the Intel-certified guarantee around bandwidth and daisy-chain support, so a well-specced USB4 dock is often the more cost-effective match.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many devices can I actually daisy-chain off a TB4 dock?",
    a: "TB4 technically supports up to 6 daisy-chained devices, but each one reduces the bandwidth available further down the chain. A practical limit is a dock plus one external SSD plus one display before performance starts to degrade.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my dock's charging fall short of its rated wattage?",
    a: "A dock rated at 100W power delivery typically sends 85-90W to the connected laptop, since 10-15W is used to power the dock's own circuitry. If your laptop, like a 16 inch MacBook Pro under heavy load, needs more than the effective delivered wattage, look for a dock rated 130W or higher.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a DisplayLink triple-monitor dock a good fit for photo editing?",
    a: "Not for your primary working display. DisplayLink compresses video output through the CPU rather than passing it through natively, which introduces color inconsistency that color-critical photo and video work will notice. It's fine for a secondary reference monitor, but keep your main editing display on a native TB4 connection.",
