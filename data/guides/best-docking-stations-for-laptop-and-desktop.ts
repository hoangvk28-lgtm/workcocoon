    question: "Can one docking station work with both a laptop and a desktop?",
    answer: "Yes, with two approaches: (1) A KVM docking station connects both simultaneously and switches between them with a button. (2) A standard dock connects one computer at a time -- swap the upstream cable when switching. KVM docks cost more but eliminate cable handling. Standard docks are cheaper and sufficient for infrequent switching.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a KVM switch and do I need one?",
    answer: "KVM stands for Keyboard, Video, Mouse. A KVM switch shares one keyboard, monitor set, and mouse between two or more computers. A KVM docking station combines a dock with a KVM switch. You need KVM if you switch between two computers frequently enough that swapping cables is annoying -- typically 5+ switches per day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a desktop need a docking station?",
    answer: "Usually not. Most desktops have enough ports (HDMI, USB-A, Ethernet) built in. A desktop benefits from a dock only in a KVM shared-desk setup where it needs to connect via USB-C alongside a laptop.",
  },
  {
    question: "What connection does my desktop need for a dock?",
    answer: "USB-C is sufficient for a standard dock (Selore) or KVM (StarTech). USB4 or Thunderbolt provides faster bandwidth (Plugable, Anker 777) but requires those specific ports on the desktop -- uncommon on standard desktops, present on higher-end builds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a docking station that works with a MacBook and a Windows PC?",
