export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Do third-party docks charge Dell laptops slower than Dell-branded docks?",
    a: "Often yes. Dell docks negotiate full rated wattage with a Dell laptop through a proprietary power protocol, while third-party docks like the Plugable TBT-UDM or Anker Prime deliver standard USB-C Power Delivery, which can be lower than what a Dell laptop is capable of accepting from an OEM dock.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between the Dell WD19TBS, WD22TB4, and SD25TB4?",
    a: "The WD19TBS is Dell's Thunderbolt 3 dock, the WD22TB4 is the previous-generation Thunderbolt 4 modular dock, and the SD25TB4 and SD25TB4 Pro are Dell's current Thunderbolt 4 Smart Dock generation with higher power delivery and, on the Pro model, 8K display support.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why isn't my new Dell dock being recognized?",
    a: "New Dell laptops default to Thunderbolt \"user authorization\" mode, meaning a dock may not be recognized until you approve it through a Windows notification or the BIOS Thunderbolt security settings. This is a very common first-boot issue and rarely means the dock is defective.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a Dell modular dock actually upgradeable?",
    a: "Some Dell docks are marketed with a detachable host module positioned as an upgrade path to future standards. Currently, no upgrade module is actually available for most of these dock generations despite the marketing claim, so buy based on the dock's current specs rather than a promised future upgrade.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use an HP or Anker dock with my Dell laptop?",
    a: "Yes, third-party docks like the HP USB-C Dock G5 and Anker Prime 14-Port are built for cross-brand compatibility including Dell laptops. You'll get standard USB-C Power Delivery rather than Dell's OEM full-rated wattage, but all core dock functions, displays, USB, Ethernet, work normally.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Dell's portable USB-C adapters the same as a docking station?",
    a: "No. Dell's portable multiport adapters frequently appear in docking station search results but typically have no power delivery passthrough to charge the laptop while providing video output. If you need to charge your Dell laptop while it's connected to external displays, confirm the product is an actual dock, not a portable adapter.",
