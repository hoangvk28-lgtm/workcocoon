export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

  { q: "What's the best gaming chair for adults over 250 lbs?", a: "The Anda Seat Kaiser 3 XL (395 lb capacity) and LEMBERI (400 lb capacity) are the strongest picks in this guide for adults over 250 lbs. Both are built with reinforced frames rated well above the average adult's weight, which gives real safety margin rather than sitting at the chair's stated limit." },
  { q: "Do gaming chairs actually help with back pain for adults?", a: "Chairs with adjustable lumbar support, like the Secretlab Titan Evo's 4-way system or the Razer Iskur V2 X NewGen's integrated lumbar, can meaningfully reduce lower back strain during long sitting sessions when adjusted correctly to your spine's curve. Based on product specs and buyer feedback, the adjustability matters more than the chair's price for actual pain relief." },
  { q: "Is it worth spending $600+ on a gaming chair instead of $100?", a: "It depends on hours of daily use. For adults sitting 6 or more hours a day, the Secretlab Titan Evo's 4-way lumbar, 4D armrests, and 5-year warranty represent a real long-term investment. For occasional use of 1 to 2 hours daily, a budget pick like the LEMBERI or GTPLAYER F59GT covers the essentials at a fraction of the cost." },
  { q: "What's the difference between PU leather, PVC leather, and fabric gaming chairs?", a: "PU leather (used on the Razer Iskur V2 X NewGen) is common but varies widely in durability. PVC leather (Anda Seat Kaiser 3 XL) tends to be thicker and more resistant to peeling. Fabric options like the Anda Seat Novis's linen or the Dowinx's mesh breathe better and run cooler but show wear differently over time than leather." },
  { q: "Do I need a footrest on a gaming chair?", a: "A footrest, like the ones on the RESPAWN 110 Pro and GTPLAYER F59GT, is useful if you plan to recline and rest during breaks rather than just sit upright while gaming. If you mainly use the chair at a desk in an upright position, a footrest adds bulk without much daily benefit." },
  { q: "How long do gaming chairs typically last for adults with daily use?", a: "Premium chairs with steel frames and longer warranties, like the Secretlab Titan Evo (5-year warranty) and Anda Seat Kaiser 3 XL (lifetime warranty), are built to hold up for 5-plus years of daily adult use. Budget chairs under $110 are reasonable for 2 to 3 years of regular use before cushioning and mechanisms may need replacing." },
