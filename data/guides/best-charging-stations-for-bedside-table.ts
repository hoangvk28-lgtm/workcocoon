    question: "Is it safe to charge phone overnight on a wireless pad?",
    answer: "Yes. All Qi2-certified and modern Qi chargers include overcharge protection, thermal management, and automatic shutoff when the battery reaches 100%. Leaving a phone on a wireless pad overnight is safe -- the charger stops delivering power once the battery is full and maintains trickle charge as needed.",

  },
  {
    question: "Do wireless chargers work with phone cases on a bedside table?",
