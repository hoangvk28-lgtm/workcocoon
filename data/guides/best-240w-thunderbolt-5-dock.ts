export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Advertised Wattage May Genuinely Differ Between the Manufacturer's Own Brand and Other Laptop Brands",
    "explanation": "Both Dell picks in this comparison specifically state up to 300W for Dell systems but only up to 240W for non-Dell systems using the identical physical dock, a real 60W difference tied entirely to which laptop brand you actually own rather than any change to the dock itself. This matters significantly if you're specifically buying a high-power dock and don't own a laptop from the same brand as the dock manufacturer, since you may not receive the dock's full headline wattage. Check whether a dock's power delivery figure applies universally or is specifically tiered by laptop brand, and confirm which tier applies to your actual laptop before assuming you'll get the highest advertised number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Power Supply's Total Rated Wattage Reveals Whether a Dock Can Truly Sustain Its Charging Claims Under Full Load",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit TS5 Plus pick's 330W power supply, meaningfully above its 140W host charging figure, provides real headroom to sustain full charging across all 20 ports simultaneously, while a dock with a power supply rated closer to its single charging claim has less real buffer for simultaneous multi-device use. This matters if you're connecting numerous power-hungry devices and want confidence that full charging performance holds up under real combined load, and matters less for a lighter single-laptop setup. Compare a dock's stated power supply wattage against its total charging claims across all ports combined, not just its single headline laptop-charging figure, to judge how much real headroom it actually has."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote Firmware Management Over Wi-Fi Is a Genuine Enterprise IT Feature With No Benefit for a Single Home User",
    "explanation": "The Dell Pro Enterprise Bundle specifically states IT teams can update dock firmware over Wi-Fi without a connected PC, a real capability for managing many desks across an organization remotely, but this feature provides zero practical benefit if you're the only person using a single dock at home. This matters if you're specifically deploying docks across a business or shared office and need centralized firmware management, and matters much less for personal use, where the feature's added cost isn't offset by any real benefit. Weigh whether enterprise-oriented remote management features actually apply to your deployment scale before paying a premium for them."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "WPA3 Encryption and Physical Lock Slots Add Real Security Value Specifically in Shared or Unattended Deployments",
    "explanation": "The Dell Pro Enterprise Bundle's specifically named WPA3 encryption and physical security lock slots protect against network-level and physical theft risks that matter more in a shared office or coworking environment than in a fully private home office where the dock never leaves your control. This matters if you're deploying the dock anywhere outside a fully private, controlled space, and matters less for a dock that stays permanently in a personal, locked home office. Check whether a dock specifically names concrete security features like WPA3 encryption or a physical lock slot if security is a real consideration for your specific deployment environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Total Port Count Should Be Weighed Against Your Actual Power Delivery Needs, Not Chosen Independently",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit TS5 Plus pick's 20 total ports and 330W power supply are specifically matched to each other, since a large port count without a correspondingly large power supply could mean individual ports receive less power under heavy simultaneous use than a smaller, better-matched dock. This matters if you're planning to connect many powered peripherals simultaneously, since a mismatch between advertised port count and actual power supply size could mean some connected devices don't charge or perform as expected under full load. Check that a dock's power supply wattage scales appropriately with its total port count before assuming maximum ports means maximum simultaneous performance for every connected device."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will I get the full 300W if I use a non-Dell laptop with a Dell Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "No, both Dell docks in this comparison specifically state up to 300W applies only to Dell systems, with non-Dell systems receiving up to 240W instead, so checking your laptop's brand against this tiering before buying is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when shopping for a high-power Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming a dock's single headline wattage figure applies to any laptop brand, when several docks specifically tier their maximum power delivery by whether you're using the manufacturer's own brand of laptop or a different one." },
  { "q": "Is the Dell Pro Enterprise Bundle worth the higher price for personal home use?", "a": "If you're a single home user, the enterprise-specific remote firmware management and WPA3 encryption features provide no practical benefit, so the base Dell SD25TB5 Pro or a CalDigit pick likely offers better value at a lower price." },
  { "q": "Does the CalDigit TS5 Plus's 330W power supply mean my laptop charges faster than on a smaller dock?", "a": "Not necessarily faster charging speed for the laptop itself, since host charging is capped at 140W, but the larger power supply specifically ensures that power remains sustained across all 20 connected ports simultaneously rather than being reduced under heavy combined load." },
  { "q": "Can I use these high-power docks safely with a lower-power laptop that doesn't need 240W?", "a": "Yes, these docks deliver only as much power as your connected laptop and PD 3.1 protocol actually request, so using one with a lower-power laptop is safe and simply means you won't need the dock's full rated wattage capacity." },
  { "q": "Which pick is best if I run a mix of Dell and non-Dell laptops in my household?", "a": "The CalDigit TS5 or TS5 Plus picks in this comparison don't specifically tier power by laptop brand the way the Dell docks do, making them a more predictable choice for a household with a mix of laptop brands." }
