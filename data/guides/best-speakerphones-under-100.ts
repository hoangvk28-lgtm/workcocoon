export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Corded Design Trades Portability for Genuine Reliability That a Battery-Dependent Unit Can't Match",
    "explanation": "A corded speakerphone, like the Jabra Speak 410 or Q95mini picks, draws power continuously from the USB connection, meaning it never needs charging and can't die mid-meeting the way a battery-powered unit theoretically could if left unplugged too long. This matters most for a speakerphone that lives permanently at one desk and gets used daily, where the inconvenience of occasionally checking or charging a battery outweighs any portability benefit you're not actually using. Consider whether the device will realistically ever leave its desk before choosing a wireless battery-powered pick purely for the flexibility, since an unused portability feature adds cost without benefit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mic Array Size Directly Affects How Evenly a Speakerphone Picks Up Voices Around a Larger Table",
    "explanation": "The Anker PowerConf's 6-microphone array in a 360 degree layout is designed to capture voices more evenly from all directions around a table than a speakerphone with fewer microphones, which may pick up voices closer to the device more clearly than those seated farther away or at an angle. This matters directly if your typical meeting involves several people seated around a table rather than one or two people close to the device, where mic count and array design become genuinely more important than in a simple one-on-one desk call. Check the listing's specific mic count and array description, since '360 degree pickup' can describe both single-mic and multi-mic designs with meaningfully different real-world performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Device Charging Through the Speakerphone Is a Real Bonus Feature That Adds Practical Value Beyond Calls",
    "explanation": "The Anker PowerConf's built-in PowerIQ technology lets you charge another device, like your phone, through the speakerphone itself while it's plugged in, a dual-purpose feature that effectively turns the unit into a small charging hub in addition to its primary call function. This matters if your desk setup has limited power outlets or USB charging ports available, where this feature reduces the total number of separate chargers or cables you need at your workspace. Check the listing specifically for charging-through or pass-through power features if consolidating your desk's power needs matters to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In USB Hub Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than a Speakerphone's Core Audio Function",
    "explanation": "The Q95mini's built-in USB hub is an added port-expansion feature unrelated to its core audio purpose, letting you plug in a mouse, keyboard, or other peripheral through the speakerphone rather than needing a separate USB hub or dock for a laptop with few available ports. This matters specifically for laptop users with only 1-2 USB ports total, where every peripheral competes for the same limited connections, though it's an irrelevant feature if your desktop or laptop already has ample port availability. Assess your actual available port count before treating a USB hub feature as a meaningful differentiator, since it adds no value if you already have unused ports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Formal Certification Icons on a Listing Indicate Specific, Verifiable Platform Approval, Not General Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "The Anker PowerConf's Zoom certification and the Jabra Speak 510's Microsoft Teams compatibility mention are specific claims that differ from generic phrases like 'works with most platforms', since a certification typically means the device passed the platform's own compatibility testing program. This matters in workplace settings where a company's IT policy might require certified hardware specifically, rather than accepting any device claiming general compatibility. Look for the specific certification name and platform in the listing's title or bullet points, and cross-reference it against your workplace's actual approved-hardware requirements if that applies to your situation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the Anker PowerConf's device-charging feature charge a laptop, or just smaller devices like a phone?", "a": "The PowerIQ charging technology is generally optimized for smaller devices like phones rather than laptops, which typically require higher power delivery than a speakerphone's charging port can provide." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between corded and wireless speakerphones at this tier?", "a": "Paying extra for battery-powered wireless portability on a speakerphone that will realistically never leave one desk, when a corded pick like the Jabra Speak 410 delivers the same call quality for a similar or lower price without any charging maintenance." },
  { "q": "Is the Anker PowerConf worth it over the cheaper Jabra Speak 510?", "a": "If you specifically need the largest mic array, longest battery life, or device-charging capability, yes, but if lightweight portability and fast setup matter more, the Jabra Speak 510 covers that for about $11 less." },
  { "q": "Does the Q95mini's built-in USB hub slow down data transfer to connected devices?", "a": "For typical peripherals like a mouse or keyboard, no noticeable slowdown occurs, though checking the hub's specific USB version in the listing is worth doing if you plan to transfer large files through a connected drive." },
  { "q": "Can the Jabra Speak 410's corded design still be used while traveling?", "a": "Yes, its slim design with integrated cable management and included carrying case supports travel use, though it still requires an available USB port at your destination since it has no battery-powered standalone mode." },
  { "q": "Do any of these picks support connecting to more than one device at the same time?", "a": "The Anker PowerConf and Jabra Speak 510 support Bluetooth pairing alongside their wired options, giving more multi-device flexibility than the fully corded Jabra Speak 410 or Q95mini, which are limited to their single wired connection." }
