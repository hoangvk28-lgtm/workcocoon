export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "What weight capacity should I look for in a big and tall gaming chair?", a: "Leave at least 50 lbs of headroom above your actual body weight, since the listed capacity reflects a static test rather than the cumulative stress of daily use. The DUMOS, YFO, and Cloomey all reach 500 lbs in this guide, the highest capacity available, giving heavier users the most margin." },
  { q: "Does a higher weight rating always mean a more durable chair?", a: "Not necessarily on its own. Independent certifications like BIFMA X5.1 (CAPOT, HOMRELEXA) and SGS ratings (HOMRELEXA, Cloomey, N-GEN) or specific test data like the Cloomey's 100,000 test cycle base give more confidence than a weight number alone, since they verify the frame and gas lift were actually tested to that standard." },
  { q: "How much does seat width matter compared to weight capacity?", a: "Quite a lot for comfort. The HOMRELEXA's flip armrests expand seat width from 22.8 to 38.6 inches and the DUMOS offers a 26.8-inch fixed wide seat, both addressing hip and thigh room directly. A high weight rating doesn't guarantee a wide seat, so check both specs independently." },
  { q: "Are mesh or foam cushions better for big and tall gaming chairs?", a: "Mesh, used on the CAPOT, DUMOS, and YFO, breathes better and stays cooler under sustained heavier loads, which matters more for bigger frames generating more body heat. Foam, used on the GTRACING and HOMRELEXA, offers deeper cushioning but can trap more heat over long sessions." },
  { q: "Is the GTRACING worth the higher price over budget big and tall options like the N-GEN?", a: "The GTRACING's 34,164 ratings at 4.5 stars give it by far the strongest proven track record in this guide, which is meaningful when trusting a chair with heavier, sustained loads. The N-GEN at $133.31 offers a comparable 400 lb capacity and pocket spring cushion but with a much smaller, newer review history." },
