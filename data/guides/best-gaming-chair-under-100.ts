export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

Several picks in this guide, including the Homall White, Homall Dark Black, LEMBERI, and Yaheetech, include a USB-powered massage lumbar under $100. Just keep in mind it's a motorized comfort add-on that tends to wear out before the frame or gas lift does." },
  { q: "Is a Class 3 gas lift good enough for a budget gaming chair?", a: "For most users, yes. Class 3 lifts are the standard across nearly every chair in this guide and handle typical daily use fine. Buyers who are close to a chair's maximum weight capacity may notice slower sinking over time compared to the heavier-duty Class 4 lifts found on pricier chairs." },
  { q: "Which chair in this guide has the highest weight capacity under $100?", a: "The LEMBERI Big & Tall at $99.50 supports 400 lbs, the highest capacity in this guide, thanks to a reinforced footrest and thickened steel frame built for larger users." },
  { q: "Are pocket spring cushions worth it over standard foam under $100?", a: "It comes down to preference. Both GTPLAYER picks use pocket spring cushions layered with memory foam for a softer, sofa-like feel, while the Homall and LEMBERI chairs use flat high-density or memory foam that feels firmer. Neither is more durable than the other based on available specs." },
  { q: "Is the GTPLAYER Floor Rocker a good alternative to a desk chair?", a: "Only if you're gaming from the floor or in front of a TV. At 8.6 lbs and $44.99, it's the cheapest and most portable option in this guide, but its 200 lb capacity and lack of desk-height positioning make it a console companion piece rather than a desk chair replacement." },
