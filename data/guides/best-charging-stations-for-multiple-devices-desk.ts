The tradeoff is per-port speed: 120W split across 10 active ports averages out to roughly 12W per device, which charges tablets and phones at a normal pace but is not a fast-charge solution for any single device.",

  {
    question: "How many devices can a desk charging station handle?",
    answer: "Most desktop charging stations handle 4--10 devices. The actual limit is total wattage -- a 10-port charger at 60W will slow-charge everything, while a 6-port charger at 200W fast-charges every device simultaneously. Always check total wattage, not just port count.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one charging station charge both Apple and Android devices?",
    answer: "Yes. USB-C charging (PD) and USB-A (Smart IC) work with both iOS and Android. The only exception is wireless charging: Qi2 pads at 15W work with iPhones (12+) and Qi2-certified Android phones, while standard Qi pads work with most wireless-capable phones at 5--10W.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best charging station for a family of 4?",
    answer: "The Alxum 10-Port 120W handles 10 phones simultaneously. For a family where adults also have tablets and laptops, the TESSAN 130W 8-in-1 covers phones, tablets, and one laptop from 8 ports with GaN efficiency.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need fast charging for all ports?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. If devices charge for several hours (overnight or during a full workday), standard 10W charging gets to 100% with time to spare. Fast charging matters most for short windows -- 20-minute breaks, 1-hour lunch. Prioritize fast-charge ports for the devices you top up during the day; slower ports are fine for overnight charges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a multi-device charging station charge a laptop?",
    answer: "Yes, if it has a USB-C port with Power Delivery (PD) at the right wattage for your laptop. MacBook Air M3 needs 30--35W for slow charge, 60W+ for full speed. MacBook Pro 16\" M4 needs 100W+ for useful speed, 140W for full speed. The Anker Prime 200W and UGREEN Nexode 200W both handle MacBook Pros properly. The Bototek and Alxum options do not.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a multi-device charging station and a docking station?",
    answer: "A multi-device charging station charges device batteries via USB. A docking station connects a laptop to monitors, Ethernet, USB peripherals, and also charges. If you need one connection to run your full desk setup (monitors + keyboard + mouse + network), you want a docking station.",
