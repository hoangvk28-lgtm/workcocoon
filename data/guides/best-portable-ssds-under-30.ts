The zinc alloy housing includes a 360-degree swivel cap that protects the connector when not in use, a detail that matters since exposed USB connectors on cheap flash-style drives are a common failure point.\n\nAgainst the other picks here, ORICO is explicit that this specific model does not support Lightning-port iPhones, only USB-C ones, a limitation worth confirming before buying if your phone is an older iPhone. The listing also offers the same design in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB if 64GB proves too small later, letting you stay within this brand's ecosystem rather than switching drives entirely.\n\nBest for buyers who specifically want one drive that plugs directly into a USB-C iPhone or Android phone without an adapter, and who don't need more than a modest amount of storage.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check That the Listing's Own Details Agree With Each Other",
    "explanation": "At the very bottom of the price range, some listings contain internal inconsistencies, like a title claiming one capacity while the feature text mentions a completely different number. This usually signals a templated or copy-pasted listing rather than one written specifically for that exact product. Before buying, skim the full feature list for any contradiction with the title or main image, and treat a clear mismatch as a reason for caution rather than assuming it's a harmless typo."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Vague Speed Claim Tells You Less Than a Specific Number",
    "explanation": "Some budget listings describe performance only in general terms like \"fast and stable\" rather than citing an actual MB/s figure, while others state a specific number like 400MB/s read speed. A specific figure gives you something concrete to compare against other drives and against your actual use case, like transferring a folder of photos versus a single large video file. Prefer a listing with a stated number when you can, and treat the absence of one as a minor but real information gap, not a dealbreaker on its own."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "64GB Fills Up Faster Than It Sounds",
    "explanation": "At this price tier, 64GB is a genuinely small amount of storage by modern standards, roughly enough for a few thousand photos or a couple of hours of compressed video, not a general-purpose backup drive. If you're buying primarily to free up space on a phone, 64GB can work fine for that narrow purpose, but if you want one drive to handle transfers, backups, and file storage more broadly, the jump to 128GB for a similar or even lower price, as seen in this comparison, is usually the better default."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual Connector Design Avoids Needing a Second Cable",
    "explanation": "A drive with both a USB-A and USB-C connector built into the same body, rather than just one connector type, means you don't need to separately track down an adapter when moving between an older USB-A laptop and a newer USB-C device. This is a genuine convenience feature at this price tier, not just a marketing checkbox, since a lost or forgotten adapter effectively makes a single-connector drive unusable on the wrong device until you find one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Brand Recognition Matters More When You Can't Verify Reviews Deeply",
    "explanation": "At the very cheapest end of any product category, some listings come from brands with little public track record, making it harder to judge long-term reliability from reviews alone. A recognized storage brand, even at the same price point, generally carries more accountability and support infrastructure if something goes wrong. This isn't a reason to avoid unfamiliar brands entirely, since many perform fine, but it's a legitimate factor to weigh if you've had a bad experience with off-brand electronics before."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a $20 portable SSD actually a solid-state drive, or is it a flash drive in disguise?", "a": "Check the listing carefully. Most products marketed as \"portable SSD\" at this price genuinely use solid-state storage, but the packaging and form factor can look similar to a basic USB flash drive. Look for a stated NAND flash or SSD-specific description in the feature text, and be cautious of listings whose title and feature descriptions don't match each other." },
  { "q": "Why does one listing say 64GB and mention 1TB somewhere in its description?", "a": "This kind of inconsistency shows up occasionally in budget listings that appear to reuse templated description text across multiple product variants without fully updating every mention. Treat it as a signal to double-check the actual capacity you're ordering, and consider it a mark against that specific listing's quality control." },
  { "q": "Will a 64GB or 128GB drive at this price work with my USB-C iPhone?", "a": "Only if the listing specifically confirms USB-C iPhone compatibility, since Lightning-port and USB-C iPhones use physically different connectors. The ORICO pick in this comparison explicitly lists iPhone 16 and 17 compatibility; don't assume a generic \"works with iPhone\" claim covers your specific model without checking." },
  { "q": "Is it worth paying more for a recognized storage brand at this price tier?", "a": "It can be, mainly for peace of mind and support if something goes wrong, rather than for a meaningful performance difference. In this comparison, the branded Lexar pick doesn't outperform the cheaper generic options on speed, so the extra cost is really paying for brand track record, not raw capability." },
  { "q": "How much storage do I actually need for basic phone backup?", "a": "It depends heavily on how many photos and videos you're storing, but 64GB is workable for a modest photo library and occasional video, while 128GB gives noticeably more breathing room for the same or only slightly higher price at this tier, based on the picks in this comparison." },
  { "q": "Do these drives need to be reformatted before use on both Mac and Windows?", "a": "Most drives at this price ship ready to use across major platforms without reformatting, since manufacturers generally pre-format for broad compatibility, but always check the specific listing's compatibility section to confirm before assuming it works with both operating systems out of the box." }
