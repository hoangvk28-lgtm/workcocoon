export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A PoE Extender's Available Power Drops at Every Additional Daisy-Chain Hop, Not Just at the Final Maximum Distance",
    "explanation": "The Intellinet pick specifically documents power dropping from 24.6W at 656ft with one unit down to 8.6W at 1968ft with five units chained together, a gradual and substantial reduction at every additional hop rather than a single cliff-edge drop only at the absolute maximum distance. This matters significantly if you're daisy-chaining multiple extenders to reach a device that needs a specific minimum wattage, since the power available partway through the chain, not just at the final unit, determines whether your device gets adequate power. Check a listing for power figures at each specific daisy-chain length relevant to your installation, not just its single best-case or worst-case number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA Compliance Is a Real Procurement Requirement for Government and Some Institutional Buyers, Not a Generic Feature",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet pick's specifically stated NDAA compliance means the hardware meets federal procurement rules that restrict networking equipment from certain manufacturers, a genuine legal requirement for many US and Canadian government and institutional purchases rather than a marketing checkbox. This matters significantly if you're purchasing on behalf of an organization subject to these procurement rules, and matters not at all for a typical home or small business installation with no such restriction. Verify whether your specific organization has an NDAA compliance requirement before assuming any networking hardware purchase needs to meet that standard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Manufacturer Warranty Reflects Real Confidence in Long-Term Hardware Reliability",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet pick's specifically stated 3-year Manufacturer Protection meaningfully exceeds the roughly 1-year warranty typical of many competing PoE extenders, a real difference in how long you're covered if the hardware fails during years of continuous operation. This matters if you're installing an extender as permanent infrastructure you expect to run for several years without replacement, and matters less if you tend to upgrade or replace networking hardware more frequently regardless of warranty status. Compare warranty length specifically, not just price, when an extender will serve as long-term infrastructure rather than a short-term or temporary installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Extender That Powers Multiple Devices From One Unit Delivers More Value Per Dollar for a Multi-Device Installation",
    "explanation": "The YuanLey pick specifically powers up to three separate PoE devices from a single input unit, meaningfully more value per dollar than a single-port extender if your actual installation involves multiple nearby devices needing extension, since you'd otherwise need multiple single-port extenders to achieve the same coverage. This matters if you have two or three devices installed near each other but far from your PoE switch, and matters less if you only have one device that needs extending. Count your actual number of devices needing PoE extension before choosing between a single-port extender and a multi-port model, since the per-device cost can differ substantially."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An IP67 Outdoor Rating Includes Fully Enclosed and Waterproof-Capped Cable Ports, Not Just a Sealed Housing",
    "explanation": "The WAVLINK pick specifically states its cable ports are enclosed and protected with waterproof caps as part of its IP67 rating, addressing the cable entry points, which are often the actual weak point for water intrusion, rather than just certifying the main housing body alone. This matters if you're installing in a genuinely outdoor location where cable connections are exposed to rain or moisture, and matters less for an indoor installation where port-level waterproofing provides no practical benefit. Check whether an outdoor-rated extender's waterproofing specifically extends to its cable ports and connectors, not just its main enclosure, for a genuinely weatherproof installation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How far can I actually extend a PoE connection with these extenders?", "a": "It depends on the specific pick and configuration; the Intellinet extender documents up to 1968ft using a 5-unit daisy chain, while a single unit typically extends around 328ft to 656ft, so checking each listing's specific distance-and-power breakdown for your planned chain length is important." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming a daisy chain's maximum distance figure comes with the same power output as a single unit, when power specifically decreases at each additional hop in the chain, as documented on the Intellinet pick." },
  { "q": "Is the Intellinet extender worth the higher price over the TRENDnet pick?", "a": "If you need the most detailed power documentation and the longest total daisy-chain distance, the Intellinet's higher price is justified, but if warranty length or NDAA compliance matters more to you, the TRENDnet pick's 3-year coverage may be the better fit despite its lower price." },
  { "q": "Do I need an outdoor-rated extender if my device is mounted indoors?", "a": "No, an IP67 outdoor rating like the WAVLINK pick's provides no practical benefit for a fully indoor installation, so an indoor-oriented extender like the Intellinet or TRENDnet picks is a more cost-appropriate choice for that scenario." },
  { "q": "Can I power more than one device with a single PoE extender?", "a": "Yes, the YuanLey pick in this comparison specifically powers up to three separate devices from one input unit, a more cost-effective solution than using multiple single-port extenders if you have several nearby devices needing extension." },
  { "q": "Does NDAA compliance matter for a home network installation?", "a": "No, NDAA compliance is specifically a federal procurement requirement relevant to government and some institutional buyers in the US and Canada, and has no practical relevance for a typical home or small business network installation." }
