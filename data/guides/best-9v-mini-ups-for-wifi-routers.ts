    "explanation": "Every router's power adapter is labeled with a specific output voltage, usually 5V, 9V, or 12V, and current draw in amps, and a mini UPS supplying the wrong voltage can damage the router even when the connector physically plugs in fine, since the barrel connector shape doesn't guarantee the electrical output matches.\n\nThis matters more than almost any other spec on the listing, since a capacity mismatch just means shorter runtime, but a voltage mismatch is a real damage risk to your router.\n\nCheck your router's power adapter label for its exact voltage and amperage before comparing any mini UPS options by capacity or price."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Convert mAh to watt-hours to compare capacity fairly across products",
    "explanation": "Raw mAh (milliamp-hour) figures aren't directly comparable between products built around different cell voltages, a 20,000mAh unit built on a 3.7V cell and a 10,400mAh unit built on a higher-voltage pack can carry genuinely similar real energy despite the very different headline number.\n\nThis matters because ranking mini UPS options purely by the mAh figure printed largest on the box can be misleading, the number that actually predicts runtime is watt-hours (Wh), not mAh alone.\n\nLook for a stated Wh figure in the listing, or calculate it yourself by multiplying mAh by the pack's voltage and dividing by 1000, before ranking products by capacity claims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm connector size and polarity match your specific router",
    "explanation": "Most mini UPS units for routers use a common 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC barrel connector, but not every product does, and center-pin polarity, whether the tip is positive or negative, varies between brands even at the identical voltage and connector size.\n\nThis matters directly because a mismatched polarity can damage your router the very first time you plug it in, even though the physical connector fit seemed fine.\n\nCheck both the connector diameter and the stated polarity against your router's original power adapter, not just the voltage number, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the combined wattage ceiling, not each port's individual maximum rating",
    "explanation": "A mini UPS with multiple output ports rarely guarantees that every port can deliver its individually listed maximum rating simultaneously, the unit has one shared total wattage ceiling that all active ports draw from together.\n\nThis matters directly if you're powering more than one device, a router and a modem or camera, off the same unit, since adding up each device's wattage and comparing that sum against the unit's total output ceiling is the only way to confirm it can actually run everything at once without undervolting.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated total wattage ceiling, and add up your actual devices' combined draw before assuming any multi-port unit handles your full setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Treat advertised runtime hours as a best case, not a guarantee",
    "explanation": "Manufacturer runtime claims like \"up to 5 hours\" are typically measured against a specific, often quite low, wattage load that may not match your actual router's real power draw, a router pulling 10-15W under normal operation will drain the same battery meaningfully faster than the manufacturer's lighter test load implies.\n\nThis matters because comparing units purely by advertised runtime hours can be misleading when the underlying test conditions aren't disclosed or standardized across brands.\n\nCheck your router's actual rated power draw in watts, and treat any published runtime figure as an optimistic upper bound rather than what you'll experience during a real outage."
