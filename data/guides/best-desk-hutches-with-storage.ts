The FSC-certified wood construction comes in white and sits wide enough to clear a 24-inch monitor while still leaving shelf space on both sides.\n\nWith nearly 40,000 reviews, it has the strongest buyer validation in this category.

    q: "What width desk hutch do I need for a 27-inch or 28-inch monitor?",
