  {
    "criterion": "Understand the difference between a fully split board and a fixed-gap split design",
    "explanation": "\"Split keyboard\" covers a wide range of actual designs, some are two genuinely separate halves connected by a cable that you can position independently at your own preferred shoulder width, while others are a single fixed board with a gap molded into the middle at one preset width.\n\nThis distinction matters directly for the actual ergonomic benefit, a true split lets you match the gap to your own shoulder width for genuinely neutral wrist and shoulder positioning, while a fixed-gap design offers a smaller, preset benefit that may not match your body.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for whether the halves are truly separate and independently positionable, not just whether the word \"split\" appears in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check tenting angle adjustability if forearm rotation strain is your actual concern",
    "explanation": "Tenting refers to angling each half of the keyboard upward toward the center, which reduces forearm pronation (the twisting motion of resting your palms flat), and adjustable tenting legs or built-in stands let you dial in an angle that suits your specific comfort level, while a flat, non-tenting split keyboard still separates your hands but doesn't address forearm rotation at all.\n\nThis matters more if forearm or wrist strain from flat typing is the actual problem you're trying to solve, less if hand separation alone is your main goal.\n\nCheck whether tenting angle is adjustable and by how many degrees, not just whether the keyboard is described as \"ergonomic.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider the real adjustment period before judging whether a split layout works for you",
    "explanation": "Switching to a split keyboard involves a genuine adjustment period, typically one to three weeks, during which typing speed and accuracy commonly drop before the new hand positioning becomes natural, this is a normal part of the transition, not a sign the keyboard is a bad fit or poorly made.\n\nThis matters most for anyone whose job depends on fast, accurate typing, where a temporary speed drop during the adjustment period has a real short-term cost worth planning around.\n\nCheck reviews for mentions of how long the adjustment period took for reviewers with a similar typing-heavy workflow to yours, and consider trying the new layout during a lower-stakes work period rather than a deadline crunch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match layout size (full-size, tenkeyless, or compact) to your actual number-pad and function-key usage",
    "explanation": "Split keyboards come in full-size, tenkeyless (no number pad), and more compact layouts that also drop the function row or arrow keys, and this size choice is a real tradeoff between desk space and reduced mouse reach versus keys available without a modifier combination.\n\nThis matters directly if you regularly use a number pad for data entry or spreadsheets, a compact split layout without one adds real friction, while someone who never touches the number pad gains a shorter, more neutral reach to the mouse with a smaller layout.\n\nCheck the specific layout size and key count against your actual daily workflow, not just the general \"ergonomic\" category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless convenience against the cable management a split design already requires",
    "explanation": "A split keyboard already involves a cable connecting the two halves (unless it's fully wireless per-half), so the calculus around wireless connectivity is slightly different than for a standard keyboard, going wireless eliminates the desk cable entirely but adds battery management for what's often already a more complex setup.\n\nThis matters more if desk cable clutter is a real concern for your specific setup, less if you're already running a cable between the two halves regardless.\n\nCheck whether the connecting cable between halves is required even in a \"wireless\" model, since some split keyboards still need it despite wireless computer connectivity."
