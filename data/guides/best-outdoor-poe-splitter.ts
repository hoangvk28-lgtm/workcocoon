export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Outdoor PoE Splitter Prices Span an Enormous Range Because They Solve Genuinely Different Problems",
    "explanation": "The picks in this comparison range from $8.88 for a basic camera-combiner splitter to $167.20 for a TAA-compliant industrial unit with extreme temperature tolerance, a nearly 20-fold price difference reflecting genuinely different product categories rather than one being simply a worse deal than the other. This matters significantly since comparing these products purely on price without understanding what problem each one actually solves would lead to a mismatched purchase. Identify your actual specific need (combining cameras, converting to a specific DC voltage, extreme temperature tolerance, or procurement compliance) before comparing prices, since these outdoor splitters aren't interchangeable despite sharing the same general category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP67 Waterproofing Must Specifically Extend to Cable Connection Points, Not Just the Main Housing Body",
    "explanation": "The MokerLink pick specifically instructs passing the network cable through a waterproof cap before making the RJ45 connection, since cable entry points are often the actual vulnerability in an otherwise weatherproof enclosure, a detail that determines whether the unit's rated IP67 protection is achieved in practice. This matters significantly for a genuinely outdoor or wet-location installation where water intrusion at connection points could damage the splitter or connected equipment, and matters less for an indoor installation where this waterproofing feature provides no practical benefit. Follow an outdoor splitter's specific cable installation instructions carefully rather than assuming its IP rating holds regardless of how the cable connection is physically assembled."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "TAA Compliance Is a Real Federal Procurement Requirement, Not a Generic Quality Marketing Claim",
    "explanation": "The IPOE-175S pick specifically states TAA (Trade Agreements Act) compliance, meeting federal procurement rules that restrict certain products from specific countries of origin for US government purchases, a genuine legal requirement rather than a general quality indicator. This matters significantly if you're purchasing on behalf of a government agency or contractor subject to TAA rules, and matters not at all for a private residential or commercial installation with no such requirement. Verify whether your specific organization has a TAA compliance requirement before assuming any outdoor networking hardware purchase needs to meet that standard, since it adds real cost without practical benefit for non-government buyers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Combiner Splitter Solves a Cable-Routing Problem, Not a Voltage Conversion Problem, Despite Sharing the 'Splitter' Name",
    "explanation": "The Ethernet Splitter Combiner pick specifically runs two nearby cameras on one cable back to a switch, a fundamentally different function from the DC voltage conversion that the MokerLink and REVODATA picks perform, even though all three share the general 'PoE splitter' product category name. This matters if your actual installation problem is running excessive cable to two nearby cameras, where a combiner is the right tool, versus needing to power a specific non-PoE device requiring DC conversion, where a voltage-converting splitter is necessary instead. Identify whether your actual outdoor installation problem is cable routing for multiple nearby devices or voltage conversion for a non-PoE device before choosing between these genuinely different product types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Extreme Temperature Ratings Matter Significantly More for Genuinely Harsh Climates Than for Typical Outdoor Exposure",
    "explanation": "The IPOE-175S pick's -40C to 75C operating range meaningfully exceeds the -20C to 60C range on the REVODATA pick, a real difference that matters in genuinely extreme climates like far northern installations facing severe winter cold or desert installations facing intense summer heat. This matters significantly if your installation location experiences real temperature extremes beyond typical moderate outdoor conditions, and matters less in a temperate climate where any outdoor-rated splitter in this comparison would perform adequately. Compare a splitter's specific operating temperature range against your actual installation location's real climate extremes, rather than assuming any 'outdoor rated' product handles any climate equally well."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the difference between a PoE combiner splitter and a voltage conversion splitter?", "a": "A combiner splitter, like the lowest-priced pick in this comparison, runs two nearby cameras on one cable back to a switch without converting voltage, while a voltage conversion splitter like the MokerLink or REVODATA picks specifically converts PoE to a set DC voltage for powering a non-PoE device." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an outdoor PoE splitter?", "a": "Comparing outdoor splitters purely by price without recognizing they solve genuinely different problems, from combining cameras to converting specific DC voltages to meeting extreme temperature or procurement requirements, making direct price comparison misleading." },
  { "q": "Is the IPOE-175S industrial splitter worth its much higher price for a residential installation?", "a": "For a typical residential or small business outdoor installation, the IPOE-175S's TAA compliance and extreme temperature rating are likely overkill, and the MokerLink or REVODATA picks deliver adequate outdoor protection at a much lower price." },
  { "q": "Can I use the basic combiner splitter for cameras that aren't near each other?", "a": "No, the combiner splitter is specifically designed for two cameras mounted near each other sharing one cable run back to the switch, not for extending distance to cameras spread far apart, which would require a different type of PoE extender instead." },
  { "q": "Do I need IP67 rating for an outdoor splitter mounted under a covered eave?", "a": "A partially sheltered location under a covered eave may not need the full IP67 rating that a fully exposed installation requires, though checking your specific location's actual rain and moisture exposure before deciding is worth doing." },
  { "q": "How do I know if I need 12V or 24V output for an outdoor device?", "a": "Checking your specific device's power specification label or documentation for its exact voltage requirement is the reliable way to confirm which output you need before choosing between a 12V splitter like the MokerLink or a 24V converter like the REVODATA pick." }
