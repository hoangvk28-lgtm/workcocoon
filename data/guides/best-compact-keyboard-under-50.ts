  {
    q: "Is a compact keyboard better for a small desk?",
    a: "Yes for desk space management. A TKL saves about 8 cm vs a full-size keyboard. A 65% saves about 13 cm. On a 70 to 90 cm desk that difference is real, with more room for mouse movement, notebook, or a less cluttered surface. The trade-off is losing keys you may use depending on layout.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best compact mechanical keyboard under $50?",
    a: "For typing feel, the Keychron C3 Pro at about $35 with gasket mounting and QMK/VIA is exceptional. For wireless flexibility, the RK61 with tri-mode wireless and hot-swap under $45 is the better pick. Choose based on whether wireless is essential to your setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are wireless keyboards under $50 reliable?",
    a: "The RK61, RK68 Plus, TH80 SE, and Tecware Phantom+ Elite all offer 2.4 GHz wireless which is reliable for desk use. Bluetooth adds multi-device flexibility but with marginally higher latency. For gaming, 2.4 GHz is preferred. For typing and productivity, either is fine.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between 60% and TKL keyboards?",
    a: "A 60% keyboard (61 keys, about 29 cm wide) removes the numpad, function row, navigation cluster, and arrow keys, all accessible via Fn layers. A TKL (87 keys, about 36 cm) removes only the numpad, keeping everything else dedicated. TKL is much easier to adapt to; 60% requires a relearning period.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need hot-swappable switches under $50?",
    a: "If this is a long-term board (1 to 3 years or more), hot-swap lets you replace individual broken switches without soldering and experiment with different switch feels. If it is a short-term or secondary keyboard, hot-swap is a nice addition rather than essential.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which compact keyboard under $50 works best for Mac?",
    a: "The Logitech K380s is designed explicitly for macOS and iPadOS with correct key labeling, proper Fn mapping, and 3-device Bluetooth for switching between Mac, iPad, and iPhone. The Keychron C3 Pro also includes Mac keycaps and a system toggle but is wired-only.",
