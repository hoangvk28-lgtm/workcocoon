      "The REIBII packs six shelves into a three-tier rustic brown frame, giving it more individual shelf compartments than most hutches in this roundup while keeping the vertical footprint reasonable for a dorm desk. Based on its listed specs, the extra shelf divisions make it easier to separate textbooks by class, keep supplies grouped, and display personal items without everything stacking on top of each other.\n\nThe rustic brown finish pairs with wood-tone or neutral dorm furniture rather than the white finishes several other picks in this guide use, so it suits students who want a warmer look. As a newer listing it does not yet have an established review history, so it is worth checking current buyer feedback before ordering, especially regarding shelf sturdiness at this price.",

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What size desk hutch fits a standard dorm desk?",
    a: "Most dorm-issue desks are between 30 and 40 inches wide. A hutch between 31 and 38.6 inches wide fits the majority of dorm desk configurations. The Snughome 31.9-inch model suits narrower desks, while the Furinno 37-inch and Snughome 38.6-inch models are better for standard-size dorm furniture.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are desk hutches allowed in dorm rooms?",
    a: "Most universities allow freestanding desk hutches since they sit on the desk surface without any wall attachment. Some schools restrict wall anchoring, which is why anti-tip kits that clamp to the desk edge are a safer option in dorm settings. Always verify your specific school housing policy before purchasing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a dorm desk hutch hold textbooks?",
    a: "Yes, most open-shelf hutches in this roundup hold standard textbooks well. A full course load of 5-6 large textbooks weighs approximately 15-25 lbs total. The sturdier models like the Snughome and Tangkula handle this without issue. Lightweight budget models like the Furinno are better for paperbacks and notebooks than heavy technical textbooks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a hutch with outlets and LED lights worth it for a dorm?",
    a: "If your dorm room has limited wall outlets, a hutch like the HOOBRO with two AC outlets and two USB ports eliminates the need for a separate power strip on the desk. The LED strip replaces a small desk lamp. For students in older dorms with limited outlets, the combined value of these features at $49.99 is significant.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I keep a desk hutch stable without drilling into the dorm wall?",
    a: "Most desk hutches in this roundup are stable enough on a flat desk surface without wall anchoring. The Tangkula includes an anti-tip kit for additional security without wall attachment. Placing heavier items on lower shelves and lighter items higher up reduces the center of gravity and prevents tipping in most normal-use conditions.",
