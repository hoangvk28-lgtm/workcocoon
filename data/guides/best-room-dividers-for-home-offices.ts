  "A room divider for a home office is usually chosen to create a visual boundary in a shared living space, but it's worth being upfront about what these products can and can't do for sound. Fabric folding screens and curtain-style dividers absorb some sound reflections in the room and reduce echo, which can genuinely help how you sound on a video call, but they do not block sound from traveling between rooms the way a solid wall with mass and an air gap does.",
  "Below are 8 room dividers we evaluated on stability, floor gap coverage, panel count, and video-call background suitability, ranging from $30.99 to $59.99. Three of the picks below are newer listings without rating data yet, and for those we describe honestly what type of divider they are based on the listing details rather than presenting invented review numbers or acoustic claims the products don't support.",

Its higher review count gives it a more established track record than the newer lockable-wheel pick above.\n\nSame acoustic honesty applies here as the other fabric panel dividers in this list, it will reduce echo and reflections but will not meaningfully block sound from an adjacent room.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check freestanding stability against your actual floor type, not just an empty room demo",
    "explanation": "A freestanding divider relies entirely on its own base footprint and panel angle for stability, with no wall support, and how well it actually stays upright varies depending on floor type, a divider that stands solidly on carpet can behave differently on hardwood or tile, and panels catching a draft from an HVAC vent can wobble more than expected.\n\nThis matters because a divider that looks stable in a still product photo can still tip or shift with regular foot traffic brushing past it.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world stability mentions on floor types similar to yours, and check the base footprint width relative to the divider's height, since a taller divider needs a wider base to stay stable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm genuine sound dampening if acoustic privacy is the actual goal, not just visual blocking",
    "explanation": "A room divider marketed as \"acoustic\" should use a real sound-dampening material, typically a felt or fabric-wrapped panel core, that measurably reduces noise transmission, distinct from a simple solid panel or bookcase that only blocks the sightline without doing anything meaningful for sound.\n\nThis distinction matters directly if noise reduction for calls or focused work is your actual goal, since a purely visual divider does very little to dampen adjacent conversation or ambient noise regardless of how solid it looks.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated acoustic material, not just the word \"acoustic\" in the title with no supporting material description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match panel height to your ceiling and the actual privacy level you need",
    "explanation": "Panel height determines both visual privacy and how much of the room's overall openness the divider preserves, a shorter divider maintains more light and airflow but offers less real privacy, while a taller divider that extends closer to the ceiling gives stronger separation at the cost of feeling like a more permanent wall.\n\nThis matters more in a room with a high ceiling, where a standard-height divider can look and feel undersized, and less in a room with a standard 8-foot ceiling where most divider heights work proportionally.\n\nCheck the listed divider height against your room's actual ceiling height and how much visual openness you want to preserve, not just the divider's general size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh assembly and mounting requirements against whether you're renting or own the space",
    "explanation": "Room dividers span a wide range of setup requirements, from a no-drill freestanding panel that requires zero installation to a wall-mounted or track-based divider requiring drilling and potentially professional installation, and which one is appropriate depends heavily on whether you're in a rented space where drilling isn't an option, or a space you own where a more permanent installation is fine.\n\nThis matters directly for a renter, discovering after purchase that a divider requires wall-mounting hardware is a real and avoidable problem in a space where drilling isn't allowed.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for the mounting method, freestanding, no-drill, or requiring wall anchors, before ordering, especially in a rented space."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider mobility needs if the divider will move between rooms or configurations regularly",
    "explanation": "A divider on wheels or casters can be repositioned easily between rooms or reconfigured for different layouts throughout the week, useful for anyone who needs flexible zoning rather than a permanent room split, but wheels also mean the divider is inherently less stable than a fixed-base design and can shift underfoot if bumped.\n\nThis matters more if you genuinely need to move the divider often, like separating a home office from a living space only during work hours, less if it'll stay in one position long-term.\n\nCheck whether casters are lockable to prevent unwanted movement once positioned, and weigh mobility against the reduced stability it typically brings."

    q: "Will a fabric room divider actually block sound between rooms?",
    a: "No. Fabric and fiber panel screens absorb some sound reflections within the room, which reduces echo and can make you sound clearer on a call, but they do not have the mass or air gap needed to block sound transmission between spaces. A solid partition wall is the only real solution for that.",

    q: "What's the difference between a tension-rod curtain and a folding panel screen?",
    a: "A tension-rod curtain, like the SUNALLY No-Drill pick, wedges between floor and ceiling without hardware and can reach up to 10 feet tall for full floor-to-ceiling coverage. A folding panel screen, like the 4-panel picks in this list, tops out around 5-6 feet and self-supports through a zig-zag stance, offering more portability but less height.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I keep a freestanding screen from tipping over?",
    a: "Arrange the panels in a proper zig-zag angle rather than nearly flat, check for rubber non-slip feet, and if pets or kids are in the household, look for a model with lockable wheels or wall-anchor D-rings for extra stability, like the SUNALLY 6FT Lockable Wheels pick.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it safe to buy a room divider with no reviews yet?",
    a: "It carries more uncertainty than a well-reviewed listing since there's no buyer feedback confirming real-world stability or durability. Three picks in this list, the GTU Shoji screen and both Halifax wave fiber screens, are new listings without ratings, weigh that against the appeal of their spec sheets before choosing one over an established alternative.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the best divider for a clean video call background?",
    a: "A solid, neutral-colored panel positioned roughly 1-2 feet behind you reads cleanest on camera. The Black 4-Panel Screen and the Height-Adjustable Single Panel both offer a solid black finish suited to this, and avoid placing any divider directly in front of a window behind you to prevent a silhouette effect.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do room dividers usually leave a gap at the floor?",
    a: "Yes, most freestanding panel screens and curtains sit 1-2 inches off the floor, which can let a draft, light, or a pet slip underneath. A floor-length tension curtain, measured precisely to your ceiling height, comes closest to eliminating that gap among the picks in this list.",
