export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Triple-Wide Design With Multiple Storage Styles Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than a Single-Column Unit",
    "explanation": "The HOSTACK pick's combination of 12 open compartments, 2 drawers, and 2 cabinets in one wide unit lets you organize genuinely different item types, books on display, small items in drawers, clutter behind cabinet doors, without needing separate pieces of furniture for each storage style. A single-column bookshelf, even a tall high-capacity one, only offers one storage approach throughout, so consider whether your actual belongings genuinely benefit from this kind of organizational variety before assuming taller and narrower is automatically the better choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Full Glass Coverage Across Every Tier Differs Meaningfully From Partial Glass-Door Designs",
    "explanation": "The CKEASEAN pick's flip-up glass doors span all 4 tiers, creating a genuine curio-cabinet display experience where every stored item stays visible and dust-free, a more comprehensive approach than a bookshelf with only some tiers behind glass and others fully open. If displaying an entire collection under consistent dust protection matters to you, prioritize a pick with full glass coverage rather than partial glass sections mixed with open shelving."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Lower Price Doesn't Always Mean Lower Weight Capacity, So Check the Actual Numbers",
    "explanation": "The Tribesigns pick in this comparison costs $40-50 less than both the HOSTACK and CKEASEAN picks, yet its stated 350 lb weight capacity actually exceeds what either pricier pick explicitly claims, demonstrating that price and capacity don't always move together in a predictable way. Before assuming the most expensive option in a comparison automatically offers the best specifications, check the actual stated weight capacity and other core specs across all price points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Corner-Fitting Designs Remain Valuable Even at Higher Price Tiers for Specific Room Layouts",
    "explanation": "The FINETONES corner-fitting pick stays relevant in this $300-ceiling comparison specifically because room layout constraints, not just budget, drive furniture selection; a wide triple-wide unit like the HOSTACK pick simply won't fit in a room without adequate straight wall space, regardless of how much you're willing to spend. Match your actual room's available space and layout to the appropriate design category before comparing based on price and features alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Two-Person Assembly Recommendations for Larger Units Reflect Genuine Size and Weight, Not Just Caution",
    "explanation": "The HOSTACK pick's recommendation for two-person assembly due to its substantial size and weight is a practical safety and logistics consideration for a triple-wide unit of this scale, not merely a generic disclaimer. Plan to have a second person available for assembly of larger units like this, since attempting solo assembly of a heavy, wide piece of furniture increases both the difficulty and the risk of damage or injury during setup."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the HOSTACK triple-wide bookshelf too large for a standard bedroom or home office?", "a": "At 58.6 inches wide, it requires a substantial wall section, generally more suited to a living room or larger home office rather than a smaller bedroom; measure your available wall space carefully before purchasing, since this is the widest pick in this comparison by a significant margin." },
  { "q": "Do the CKEASEAN's flip-up glass doors require more clearance to open than standard swinging doors?", "a": "Flip-up doors open upward rather than outward, generally requiring vertical clearance above the unit rather than floor space in front of it, which can be an advantage in tighter rooms where a swinging door might be obstructed by nearby furniture." },
  { "q": "Why does the cheaper Tribesigns pick have a higher stated weight capacity than the pricier HOSTACK and CKEASEAN picks?", "a": "The Tribesigns pick specifically emphasizes a thickened base and reinforced construction focused on maximizing weight capacity in a single-column design, while the pricier picks prioritize different features, storage variety for HOSTACK and glass display quality for CKEASEAN, rather than raw capacity as their primary selling point." },
  { "q": "Can the FINETONES corner bookshelf be used in a room without a genuine 90-degree corner available?", "a": "It's specifically engineered for corner placement and may not sit flush or look intentional against a flat wall the way a straight-frame bookshelf would, so it's best reserved for rooms with an actual usable corner rather than as a general-purpose straight-wall alternative." },
  { "q": "How much assembly time should I expect for the HOSTACK triple-wide unit compared to the smaller picks in this comparison?", "a": "Given its substantial size, multiple storage sections, and two-person assembly recommendation, expect meaningfully longer assembly time, likely 1.5-2 hours or more with two people, compared to a simpler single-column bookshelf that might take 30-45 minutes solo." },
  { "q": "Which pick in this comparison offers the best balance of price and storage capability?", "a": "The Tribesigns pick offers a strong balance, delivering the highest stated weight capacity in this comparison at a price roughly $40-50 below the two priciest alternatives, making it the strongest overall value if you don't specifically need triple-wide storage variety or full glass display coverage." }
