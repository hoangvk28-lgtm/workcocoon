export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Separate flat panels, projectors, and portable systems",
    "explanation": "An interactive whiteboard can mean an all-in-one 4K flat panel, a projector paired with a sensor, or a portable conversion bar that turns any surface interactive. These solve different problems at very different price points, know which category you actually need before comparing specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Touch-point count is not simultaneous writing capacity",
    "explanation": "A board advertising 20-point touch does not mean 20 people can write clean, independent lines at once, some of those points cover palm rejection and gesture recognition. Check the manufacturer's stated simultaneous-writer number specifically, not just the raw touch-point spec."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "EDLA certification means something specific",
    "explanation": "Google EDLA (Enterprise Device Licensing Agreement) certification guarantees stable Google Play Store, Workspace, and Google Education Suite access with regular OTA security updates. A board merely running Android without EDLA certification may lose app-store access or updates over time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "OPS slots need a separately purchased module",
    "explanation": "Many boards advertise an OPS (Open Pluggable Specification) expansion slot for adding Windows compatibility, but the actual Windows OPS computer module is almost always sold separately and can cost as much as a mid-range laptop. Budget for it if Windows software is a real requirement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wireless casting and wireless touch-back are different features",
    "explanation": "Casting lets a phone or laptop screen display on the board. Touch-back control lets you operate that connected device's cursor directly from the board's touchscreen. Confirm which one a specific product actually supports before assuming both are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mounting weight and wall structure matter as much as specs",
    "explanation": "A 75-inch or larger panel commonly weighs 80-150+ pounds. Confirm VESA mount compatibility and that your wall studs or mounting surface can support that load safely, professional installation is often worth the cost at this size."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 55-inch interactive whiteboard too big for a home office?",
    "a": "It depends on room depth. A 55-inch board needs roughly 6-8 feet of viewing distance to read text comfortably; measure your actual wall space and seating distance before buying the largest size that fits budget-wise."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I mute the built-in camera and microphone for privacy at home?",
    "a": "Most boards with built-in cameras include a hardware or software mute option, but this varies by model, check the specific product's privacy controls before assuming a physical camera cover or hardware mute switch is included."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does Google EDLA certification actually guarantee?",
    "a": "EDLA (Enterprise Device Licensing Agreement) certification means Google has verified the device for stable, ongoing access to the Google Play Store, Google Workspace, and Google Education Suite, plus regular over-the-air security updates. A board that just runs Android without EDLA certification can lose app-store access or stop receiving updates over time."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a higher touch-point count always mean a better writing experience?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. Touch-point count measures how many contact points the sensor can track, but the number of people who can write clean, independent lines simultaneously is usually lower and separately documented by the manufacturer. Check the stated simultaneous-writer number, not just the raw touch-point spec, before assuming a 60-point board beats a 20-point one for group use."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need to buy anything extra to run Windows on a board with an OPS slot?",
    "a": "Yes, in almost every case. An OPS (Open Pluggable Specification) slot is just an expansion bay, the actual Windows computer module that plugs into it is sold separately and can cost as much as a mid-range laptop. Confirm the OPS module price before assuming Windows compatibility is included in the board's sticker price."
