  {
    "criterion": "Expect real-world sheet capacity to run below the rated figure",
    "explanation": "A shredder's rated sheet capacity, like \"10-sheet\" or \"15-sheet\", is measured under ideal lab conditions with fresh, single-type paper fed perfectly straight, real-world use with mixed paper stock, folded sheets, or slightly misaligned feeding typically shreds closer to 70-80% of the rated capacity before jamming or straining the motor.\n\nThis matters because buying exactly at your expected daily volume often means the shredder is already operating past its comfortable real-world limit on day one.\n\nSize up from your actual typical stack thickness rather than matching the rated number exactly, and check reviews for mentions of real-world jamming at the rated capacity."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match security level (P-rating) to what you're actually shredding",
    "explanation": "The P-rating (P-2 through P-7) describes the physical size and shape of the shredded particles, not how good the shredder feels, P-2 strip-cut produces long strips that are technically reconstructible, P-4 cross-cut produces confetti-sized pieces suitable for most personal and financial documents, and P-5 or higher micro-cut produces particles small enough for genuinely sensitive material.\n\nThis matters directly for documents with account numbers, social security numbers, or other identity-theft-relevant information, where strip-cut offers meaningfully weaker protection than cross-cut or micro-cut.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific P-rating number, not just the marketing terms \"cross-cut\" or \"micro-cut\" alone, since those terms can be applied loosely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check continuous run time against your actual shredding sessions",
    "explanation": "Every shredder has a maximum continuous run time before its motor needs to cool down, often just 2-5 minutes on budget models, after which it locks out for 15-30 minutes or longer while the motor cools.\n\nThis matters a great deal if you regularly shred a large stack in one sitting, hitting the run-time limit mid-task means stopping and waiting, sometimes repeatedly, before finishing the job.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for continuous run time in minutes, and compare that against how large your typical shredding sessions actually are, not just how often you shred."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider bin capacity relative to how often you're willing to empty it",
    "explanation": "A larger waste bin means fewer interruptions to empty it, but it also means a heavier bin to lift and empty when it does fill, and a shredder placed in a tight space under a desk may not have room for an oversized bin at all.\n\nBin size ranges widely across this category, from compact under-desk units around 3-4 gallons to larger office units at 6 gallons or more.\n\nCheck the listed bin capacity in gallons, and weigh it against both your available floor space and how often you're realistically willing to stop and empty it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify jam-clearing and safety features if this will see frequent or shared use",
    "explanation": "Features like anti-jam reverse function, overload sensors, and a safety lock that disables the blades when the bin is removed vary meaningfully between models at similar prices, and their absence turns an occasional paper jam into a genuine hassle involving manual disassembly.\n\nThis matters more for a shredder used frequently or by multiple people in a shared office setting than for occasional light personal use.\n\nCheck the specific listed safety and anti-jam features rather than assuming any shredder in this price range includes them, since budget models frequently omit auto-reverse or safety locks entirely."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Will my shredder actually run for its full rated continuous-run time?", a: "Only under ideal conditions. Manufacturer ratings assume consistent, light paper feeding. Real bulk-purge sessions with mixed paper weights and staples will typically hit the thermal cutoff sooner than the advertised time." },
  { q: "Which matters more for a big document purge, run time or cooldown time?", a: "Both together. A shredder with a long run time but a long cooldown (like 60 minutes on, 60 minutes off) can take just as long overall as a shorter-run shredder with a quick cooldown, check both numbers, not run time alone." },
  { q: "Is an auto-feed shredder better than a long-run manual one for a big purge?", a: "Often yes for total effort, even with a shorter rated run time, an auto-feed hopper processes documents with far less hands-on feeding than a manual shredder, meaningfully reducing the real time and effort of a large purge." },

A small bin can force an emptying stop well before the motor's rated duty cycle limit is reached.
