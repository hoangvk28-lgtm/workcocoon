export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "PFC Sine Wave Compatibility Prevents a Real, Documented Issue With Active PFC Power Supplies",
    "explanation": "Modern computer power supplies with active PFC (power factor correction) can sometimes behave erratically, shutting down unexpectedly or making an audible buzzing noise, when running on a simulated sine wave UPS during a power outage, because the PFC circuitry expects a cleaner waveform than simulated sine wave technology provides. The CyberPower CP1000PFCLCD and APC BX1000M both specifically address this by using PFC sine wave output designed to work correctly with these modern power supplies. If you have a gaming PC or workstation built in the last several years, checking whether its power supply uses active PFC, often stated in the power supply's own specifications, matters before choosing a UPS, since a compatibility mismatch here isn't just a performance nitpick but a real functional problem during an actual outage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Coaxial and Ethernet Surge Protection Extends Protection to Data Lines a Standard UPS Doesn't Cover",
    "explanation": "The APC BX1000M specifically includes built-in coaxial and Ethernet surge protection alongside its AC outlets, meaning a surge traveling through your cable TV or internet connection gets addressed by the same unit protecting your AC-powered devices, a genuinely different vulnerability than AC-only protection covers. This matters if your setup includes a cable modem, router, or TV connected via coax or Ethernet, since these connections represent real entry points for surges that AC-only protection simply doesn't address. Check specifically for coax and Ethernet protection if these connection types run through your protected equipment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Energy Star Certification Represents Independently Verified Efficiency, Not Just a Manufacturer's Efficiency Claim",
    "explanation": "The APC BX1000M's Energy Star certification confirms 92%+ efficiency through an independent verification program, meaning the unit genuinely wastes less energy as heat during normal operation compared to a UPS without this certification, translating to real, measurable electricity cost savings over years of continuous use. This matters more the longer you expect to keep the UPS plugged in and running continuously, since even a few percentage points of efficiency difference compounds into meaningful savings over a multi-year lifespan. Check for the specific Energy Star certification mark rather than accepting a general efficiency claim without independent verification."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dramatically Higher Connected Equipment Warranty at This Tier Signals Manufacturer Confidence in More Sophisticated Hardware",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD3's $500,000 Connected Equipment Guarantee substantially exceeds the CP1000PFCLCD's $350,000 and the AVRG900LCD's $200,000 coverage, despite all three being CyberPower products, suggesting the highest-capacity unit's manufacturer backs it with correspondingly stronger financial assurance reflecting its more robust internal components. This matters most if you're protecting genuinely expensive, business-critical, or difficult-to-replace equipment where the cost of potential damage would be significant enough to justify weighing this documented protection level heavily. Compare the specific warranty dollar amount against the actual replacement value of your connected equipment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime at a Specific Load Wattage Should Be Checked Against Your Actual Equipment's Combined Power Draw",
    "explanation": "The APC BX1000M's stated 42+ minutes of runtime specifically applies at a 100W load, and if your actual connected equipment, a computer, monitor, and router combined, draws significantly more than 100W, your real runtime will be proportionally shorter than this reference figure suggests. This matters because buyers often assume a stated runtime figure applies universally regardless of what's actually connected, when in reality UPS runtime scales inversely with load wattage. Calculate your actual combined equipment wattage and understand that runtime will decrease as your load increases beyond the reference wattage used in the stated runtime figure."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a PFC sine wave UPS if I have a modern gaming PC?", "a": "If your power supply specifically uses active PFC, checking its own specifications for this detail, then yes, a PFC sine wave UPS like the CP1000PFCLCD or APC BX1000M avoids potential compatibility issues that can occur with simulated sine wave UPS units during an actual power outage." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing runtime figures across UPS units at this tier?", "a": "Assuming the stated runtime applies to their exact setup, when the figure is specific to a reference load wattage, so a heavier combined equipment load will result in proportionally shorter actual runtime than the stated figure suggests." },
  { "q": "Is the APC BX1000M worth it over the CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD3 despite lower capacity?", "a": "If built-in coax and Ethernet protection plus Energy Star-certified efficiency matter to your setup, yes, but if maximum raw capacity and the highest documented warranty are your priority, the CP1500AVRLCD3's 1500VA and $500,000 guarantee lead this comparison instead." },
  { "q": "Does Energy Star certification actually save meaningful money over time?", "a": "For a UPS kept plugged in and running continuously for years, even a few percentage points of efficiency difference compounds into real electricity cost savings, making Energy Star certification a genuine long-term value consideration, not just a marketing label." },
  { "q": "Can I use the CyberPower AVRG900LCD with a modern gaming PC even though it's not PFC sine wave?", "a": "It can work, but some active PFC power supplies may behave erratically on simulated sine wave power during an actual outage, so if you specifically have this type of power supply, a PFC-compatible pick like the CP1000PFCLCD would be the safer choice." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my internet or cable connection needs the APC BX1000M's built-in coax and Ethernet protection?", "a": "If your modem, router, or TV connects via a physical coaxial or Ethernet cable rather than purely wirelessly, that connection point represents a real surge vulnerability that only a UPS with this specific built-in protection addresses." }
