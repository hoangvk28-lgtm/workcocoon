    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

  {
    q: "Will my Time Machine backups stop working because AFP is being removed?",
    a: "If your NAS is still configured to use AFP, yes, backups will silently stop once your Mac updates past macOS 27. Every NAS in this list supports SMB3 with Bonjour/mDNS advertising, which is the protocol combination Apple is standardizing on, but confirm SMB3 is actually enabled in your sharing settings rather than assuming it by default.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my Time Machine backup keep growing and filling up the NAS?",
    a: "Time Machine stores backups in a sparse bundle disk image that expands automatically over time, and without a manually set quota it will keep growing until it consumes all available NAS space. Set a quota in the NAS admin panel during initial setup, a common recommendation is roughly 1.5x your Mac's internal storage capacity.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can multiple Macs back up to the same NAS with Time Machine?",
    a: "Yes, but each Mac needs its own separate shared folder with its own quota. Using a single shared folder for more than one Mac's Time Machine backup will corrupt the backup history for both machines, so set up a dedicated folder per Mac even within the same household.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the first Time Machine backup take over a NAS?",
    a: "For a 512GB Mac, an initial full Time Machine backup over Wi-Fi can take 8-24 hours depending on your router, and considerably less over a wired Ethernet connection. Run the first backup wired if at all possible; incremental backups afterward are small enough to run comfortably over Wi-Fi.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know my Time Machine backup will actually restore if I need it?",
    a: "A backup can appear to complete successfully for months while quietly failing to produce a restorable image due to RAID errors or file corruption. Periodically, at least once a quarter, test an actual file or folder restore from the backup rather than relying on Time Machine's success indicator alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do drive compatibility warnings mean I bought the wrong drive?",
    a: "Not necessarily. Some 2024-and-newer Plus-tier NAS models show a compatibility warning in the admin panel for any drive that isn't the manufacturer's own branded line, even when a reputable third-party NAS drive like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red works fine. It's worth knowing before you buy so the warning doesn't seem like a hardware failure.",
