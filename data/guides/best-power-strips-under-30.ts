export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Connected Equipment Warranty Provides Real Financial Recourse Beyond the Surge Protector's Own Function",
    "explanation": "The Belkin pick's $300,000 Connected Equipment Warranty and the Anker pick's lifetime $200,000 equipment warranty both promise to reimburse damage to devices connected to the strip if the surge protection somehow fails to prevent that damage, a genuine financial backstop beyond simply trusting the surge protection circuitry to work perfectly every time. A strip without this documented warranty, like the LeZone or PASSUS picks in this comparison, may still offer effective surge protection, but you have less recourse if something does go wrong and a connected device is damaged. Check specifically for a named connected equipment warranty and its stated dollar coverage amount, not just general surge protection marketing language."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Higher Joule Rating From a Less Established Brand Isn't Automatically Less Trustworthy, But It Carries Different Risk",
    "explanation": "The LeZone pick's 4800 joule rating exceeds even the well-established Belkin's 3,780 joules, demonstrating that raw joule numbers don't necessarily correlate with brand recognition or price. However, an established brand like Belkin typically backs its stated joule rating with more extensive internal testing infrastructure and a longer track record of consistent quality across many products, which is a different kind of assurance than the number itself. Weigh both the stated joule rating and the brand's track record together, rather than choosing based on the highest number alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C Power Delivery Wattage Directly Determines Real-World Charging Speed for Compatible Devices",
    "explanation": "The Anker pick's 20W USB-C port specifically charges an iPhone 15 from 0 to 50 percent in 26 minutes according to the manufacturer's own testing, a concrete, verifiable claim that's meaningfully faster than a standard 5W or even 10W USB-C port would achieve. This matters specifically if you own a phone or tablet that supports fast charging standards, since a lower-wattage port won't unlock that faster charging speed regardless of how capable your device is. Check the specific stated wattage for USB-C ports and compare it against your device's fast-charging specifications before assuming any USB-C port charges at the same speed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Grouped Switches Offer a Middle Ground Between Full Individual Control and a Single Master Switch",
    "explanation": "The PASSUS Tower's 4-separated switch design lets you turn off groups of outlets together rather than managing each of its 12 outlets completely independently or all at once with a single switch, a middle-ground approach that's less precise than fully individual switches but more flexible than an all-or-nothing master switch. This matters if you want some control over which devices stay powered without needing switch-level precision for every single outlet. Consider whether grouped control meets your actual needs before assuming you need either full individual switches or none at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Recycled Material Housing Reflects a Genuine Sustainability Commitment Beyond Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "The Belkin pick's housing made with a minimum of 72 percent PCR (post-consumer recycled) material represents a specific, documented sustainability commitment that goes beyond a vague eco-friendly claim without supporting detail. This doesn't affect the strip's electrical performance or safety, but it's a genuine differentiator for buyers who factor environmental impact into purchasing decisions. Check for a specific stated percentage of recycled material rather than accepting general sustainability language as equivalent documentation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does a higher joule rating always mean better protection regardless of brand?", "a": "A higher joule rating does indicate the surge protector can absorb more energy before its protection is exhausted, but pairing that rating with an established brand's documented equipment warranty, like Belkin or Anker offer, provides additional financial assurance beyond the raw number alone." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing USB-C charging speeds across power strips?", "a": "Assuming any USB-C port charges at the same speed, when the actual wattage rating, like the Anker's 20W versus a standard 5W port, directly determines how quickly a compatible device actually charges." },
  { "q": "Is the Belkin pick worth the price premium over the LeZone with its higher joule rating?", "a": "If a documented $300,000 connected equipment warranty and an established brand's track record matter to you, yes, but if you prioritize the highest raw joule number and a longer cord at a lower price, the LeZone pick offers that instead." },
  { "q": "How does the PASSUS Tower's night light actually work in practice?", "a": "It offers three selectable brightness levels built into the tower itself, letting you use it as a soft bedside light without needing a separate lamp, a genuinely unique feature not found on the other picks in this comparison." },
  { "q": "Do I need a connected equipment warranty if I'm just powering basic devices like lamps and fans?", "a": "For inexpensive, easily replaceable devices, a connected equipment warranty matters less, but if you're plugging in expensive electronics like a computer or monitor, the added financial protection from a warranty like Belkin's or Anker's becomes more valuable." },
  { "q": "Can grouped switches like the PASSUS Tower's 4-separated design control outlets as precisely as fully individual switches?", "a": "No, grouped switches control multiple outlets together in sets rather than each outlet independently, so if you need precise single-outlet control, a pick with fully individual switches would serve that specific need better." }
