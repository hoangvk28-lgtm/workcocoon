Auto probing and surface leveling calibrate the workpiece before each cut, which matters more than raw spindle speed on uneven stock.\n\nSpindle runout under 0.0004 in and motor resolution of 0.0002 in are real, documented figures rather than a vague accuracy claim. Makera's own CAM software runs on Mac and Windows, and the controller also works across iOS, Android, and Linux, with Fusion 360 and VCarve Pro support for anyone who outgrows the bundled app.",

    description: "An upgraded Z-axis linear guideway paired with a heavy-duty structure delivers a documented ±0.05mm repeatable positioning accuracy, a genuine step up from the earlier PROVerXL 4030 V1/V2's 8-bit controllers. The 130mm Z-height pass is notably taller than most desktop routers, enabling rotary projects and thicker stock.\n\nA 710W spindle replaces the standard hobbyist spindle for stronger cutting force on harder materials like aluminum and acrylic. Speed jumps from 2000 to 5000mm/min (a 150% increase) while staying under 65dB, and the modular pre-assembled design cuts setup time by roughly 30%.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are all tormach desktop cnc machines products currently sold, or does the lineup include discontinued models?",
    "a": "Check current first-party store pages directly, since older models often stay heavily indexed in search results long after being discontinued or moved to support-only status."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does buying a well-known brand guarantee better build quality?",
    "a": "Not automatically. Brand lineups often span multiple hardware generations and price tiers, so verify the exact model's specs rather than assuming brand reputation alone predicts quality."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
