export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The 30W Source Rating Isn't What Actually Reaches Your Device After Cable Loss",
    "explanation": "The 802.3at standard specifies up to 30W delivered at the injector's output, but resistance in the Ethernet cable itself consumes some of that power over distance, meaning a device at the far end of a long cable run receives less than the full 30W the injector outputs. This matters if you're running PoE near the maximum 328-foot distance, since a device that needs close to the full 25.5W device-side minimum the standard guarantees might not get enough power over a long, lower-quality cable run. Check both your device's actual power draw and your cable run length before assuming a 30W injector guarantees 30W will reach a device at maximum distance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "First-Party Brand-Specific Injectors Remove Compatibility Guesswork That Generic Injectors Can Introduce",
    "explanation": "A first-party injector, like Ubiquiti's own 30W unit built for its U6 access point lineup, is validated by the same company that built the device it powers, while a generic third-party 30W injector should work with any standard 802.3at device but occasionally surfaces edge-case negotiation quirks with specific hardware. This matters more if you've had a prior bad experience with a generic injector and a specific device, or if you want the simplest possible troubleshooting path, and matters less if you're comfortable testing a generic injector and returning it if it doesn't work as expected. Consider a first-party injector when one exists for your specific device and you want to eliminate that variable entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "100Mbps and Gigabit Injectors at the Same Wattage Serve Very Different Bandwidth Needs",
    "explanation": "Two 30W injectors can have identical power delivery specs while one is limited to 100Mbps and the other supports full Gigabit speeds, and this distinction is about data throughput, completely separate from the power rating. This matters significantly for a 4K security camera or a busy Wi-Fi 6 access point where 100Mbps would bottleneck the actual usable bandwidth, and matters much less for a basic VoIP phone or standard-definition camera that never approaches 100Mbps of real traffic. Check the listing's stated Ethernet speed explicitly, since two listings can share the same wattage headline while differing significantly on this axis."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Auto-Shutoff Safety Feature for Non-Standard Equipment Is a Meaningfully Different Protection Than Basic Auto-Detection",
    "explanation": "Basic auto-detection simply identifies whether a connected device is a PoE device and supplies power accordingly, while a more protective design specifically detects non-standard or incompatible equipment and actively shuts off power rather than risking an unsafe power delivery attempt. This matters if you're connecting a mix of devices over time and want a safety net against accidentally connecting non-PoE equipment to a PoE port, and matters less if you have one fixed, already-confirmed-compatible device permanently connected. Look for a listing that specifically describes this active protective shutoff behavior rather than just a generic auto-detect claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge and ESD Protection Ratings Vary Meaningfully Between Listings at the Same Price Point",
    "explanation": "Some 30W injector listings specifically state surge protection ratings like 4kV and ESD protection ratings like 6kV, giving you a concrete, checkable number for how much electrical stress the unit is designed to withstand, while others simply claim general overvoltage protection without a specific rating. This matters more if the injector will be installed somewhere exposed to power fluctuations, like an older building or an outdoor-adjacent location, and matters less in a modern, stable indoor electrical environment. Compare the specific stated kV ratings when available, rather than treating all overvoltage protection claims as equivalent."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the real difference between 15.4W and 30W PoE injectors?", "a": "15.4W (802.3af) suits basic cameras and phones, while 30W (802.3at, or PoE+) is required for higher-draw devices like PTZ cameras and Wi-Fi 6 access points that need more power than the older standard provides." },
  { "q": "Can I use a 30W injector with a device that only needs 15.4W?", "a": "Yes, 30W 802.3at injectors are backward compatible with 802.3af devices and will typically auto-detect and supply the lower wattage automatically." },
  { "q": "Does a Ubiquiti access point require the first-party Ubiquiti injector?", "a": "No, most Ubiquiti U6-series access points work with any standard 802.3at 30W injector, but the first-party unit removes any small compatibility uncertainty a generic injector might introduce." },
  { "q": "Is 100Mbps enough for a security camera powered by a 30W injector?", "a": "For a standard-definition camera, yes, but a 4K camera will be bottlenecked by a 100Mbps injector regardless of how much power it delivers, so check your camera's actual resolution and bandwidth needs first." },
  { "q": "What's the maximum distance a 30W PoE injector can reliably power a device?", "a": "Standard PoE injectors are rated for up to 100 meters (328 feet), the same limit as standard Ethernet cable runs, beyond which signal and power quality both degrade." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my access point needs 30W instead of 15.4W?", "a": "Check the access point's own power specification, usually listed as either 802.3af or 802.3at compliance, or its stated maximum power draw in watts, in its product documentation or spec sheet." }
