export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Budget Extender's Real Value Depends on Price Per Device Powered, Not Just the Sticker Price Alone",
    "explanation": "The MokerLink pick's $16.98 price powers three separate devices from one unit, working out to a lower true cost per device than the DSLRKIT pick's $13.99 price for just two ports, even though the DSLRKIT has the lower headline price. This matters significantly if you need to extend multiple devices, since comparing extenders by device count divided by price reveals which option actually delivers better value for your specific need. Calculate the effective price per device powered, not just the sticker price, before assuming the cheapest-priced extender is automatically the best value for a multi-device installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Support for Both Active and Passive PoE Sources Provides Real Flexibility if You're Unsure of Your Existing Equipment",
    "explanation": "The DSLRKIT pick specifically states compatibility with both standard IEEE 802.3af/at active PoE and DC48V-57V passive PoE sources, a broader compatibility range than extenders supporting only one type, which matters if you're not certain whether your existing PoE switch or injector uses active negotiation or passive power delivery. This matters significantly if you're retrofitting an extender onto existing equipment of uncertain PoE type, and matters less if you know your PoE source is a specific, verified standard. Check whether a budget extender specifically supports both active and passive PoE sources if you're uncertain about your existing PoE infrastructure's exact type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cascade Distance Figures at the Budget Tier Still Require Purchasing Multiple Units to Reach the Maximum Stated Distance",
    "explanation": "The Revotech pick's specifically stated 2296ft maximum distance requires cascading 6 separate units together, not a single extender's individual range, meaning the real cost to reach that maximum distance is six times the single-unit price, not the headline per-unit price alone. This matters if you're budgeting for a genuinely long-distance installation using a budget extender, since the total cost for the full cascade chain adds up meaningfully even at a low per-unit price. Calculate the total cost across all units needed to reach your actual required distance before assuming a budget extender's low per-unit price reflects your total project cost."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Device Detection and Installation Protection Reduce Risk for Less Experienced Installers",
    "explanation": "The Revotech and CENTROPOWER picks both specifically state automatic detection and protection features that safeguard connected PoE equipment from damage due to incorrect installation, a genuinely valuable safety net for buyers newer to PoE installations who might not know to verify compatibility before connecting. This matters if you're installing PoE equipment for the first time or delegating installation to someone less experienced, and matters less if you're an experienced installer who already carefully verifies compatibility before connecting any device. Check for a specifically named automatic protection feature if installation error risk is a real concern for your specific situation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Single-Port Extender's Simplicity Can Be an Advantage, Not Just a Limitation, for a Basic One-Device Need",
    "explanation": "The CENTROPOWER 1-Port pick's straightforward single-device design, specifically framed for situations where power lines are unavailable, keeps installation simple and predictable for a buyer who genuinely only needs to extend one device, rather than paying for multi-port capability they won't use. This matters if your actual need is extending just one camera or access point, where a single-port extender's simplicity avoids unnecessary complexity, and matters less if you have multiple devices needing extension where a multi-port unit delivers better value. Match the extender's port count to your actual number of devices needing extension, rather than defaulting to a multi-port unit when a simpler single-port extender would serve your actual need just as well."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the cheapest PoE extender always the best value?", "a": "Not necessarily; the MokerLink pick's slightly higher price powers three devices from one unit, working out to a lower true cost per device than a cheaper single or dual-port extender, so calculating price per device is worth doing before assuming the lowest sticker price is the best deal." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a budget PoE extender?", "a": "Comparing extenders only by their headline price without accounting for how many devices each one actually powers, when a slightly pricier multi-port extender can deliver meaningfully better value per device than the cheapest single-port option." },
  { "q": "Can I use a budget PoE extender with a passive PoE source instead of a standard PoE switch?", "a": "Only the DSLRKIT pick in this comparison specifically states compatibility with passive DC48V-57V PoE sources in addition to standard active PoE, so checking a listing's stated PoE source compatibility is important if your existing setup uses passive PoE." },
  { "q": "How far can I really extend my PoE network with a budget extender?", "a": "It depends on cascading multiple units together; the Revotech pick specifically documents up to 2296ft using 6 cascaded units, so the real achievable distance and total cost depend on how many units you actually need to reach your specific installation distance." },
  { "q": "Are budget PoE extenders reliable for a long-term installation?", "a": "The Revotech and CENTROPOWER picks in this comparison both specifically include automatic detection and installation protection features that help ensure reliable operation, though as with any budget hardware, checking specific compatibility with your devices before relying on it long-term is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Do I need Gigabit speed for a basic budget PoE extender setup?", "a": "Only the DSLRKIT pick in this comparison offers Gigabit speed; the other budget picks operate at 10/100Mbps, which is adequate for standard IP cameras and basic devices but may bottleneck higher-bandwidth equipment." }
