    "explanation": "Switch type determines feel, sound, and how disruptive the keyboard is to people around you, clicky switches feel satisfying to type on solo but produce an audible click on every keystroke that can be genuinely disruptive on a Zoom call or in a shared office, while linear switches are quieter and smoother, and tactile switches split the difference with a felt bump but no click.\n\nThis matters directly based on where you'll actually use the keyboard, a home office with video calls or a shared workspace calls for a different switch than a private gaming setup where clicky feedback is a feature, not a liability.\n\nCheck the specific switch name (not just \"mechanical\") and look up its actuation force and whether it's linear, tactile, or clicky before assuming any mechanical keyboard suits your environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check hot-swappable sockets if you want to change switches later without soldering",
    "explanation": "A hot-swappable keyboard lets you physically remove and replace individual switches without any soldering, meaning you can try different switch types or replace a failed switch years later without needing to be a hobbyist with a soldering iron.\n\nThis matters directly if you're not fully certain which switch feel you'll prefer long-term, or if you want the option to upgrade switches later without replacing the whole keyboard.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"hot-swappable\" and the specific socket type (3-pin or 5-pin) it supports, since not every hot-swap socket accepts every switch type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider keycap material for both feel and long-term durability",
    "explanation": "Keycap material affects both the tactile feel under your fingers and how well the keycaps resist shine and wear over years of typing, PBT plastic is generally more durable and resists the glossy shine that ABS plastic keycaps develop after months of oil and friction from typing.\n\nThis matters more for a keyboard you'll type on daily for years, less for occasional or gaming-only use where keycap longevity matters less.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for PBT versus ABS keycap material, since this detail is sometimes buried in the specs rather than featured prominently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless convenience against connection latency for your actual use case",
    "explanation": "A wireless mechanical keyboard eliminates a desk cable but introduces a small amount of input latency compared to a wired connection, and Bluetooth in particular can have more noticeable latency than a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver, a real consideration for competitive gaming but largely unnoticeable for typing and general office work.\n\nThis matters more if you're specifically buying for fast-paced gaming, less for typing-focused office or home use where the latency difference is imperceptible.\n\nCheck whether a wireless keyboard supports a low-latency 2.4GHz dongle in addition to Bluetooth, and consider a wired connection specifically if competitive gaming performance matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match keyboard layout and size to your actual desk space and workflow",
    "explanation": "Mechanical keyboards range from full-size boards with a number pad to compact tenkeyless (no number pad) and even smaller 60% layouts that omit the function row and arrow keys, and this size choice is a real tradeoff between desk space saved and keys available without a modifier combination.\n\nThis matters directly if you regularly use a number pad for data entry, a compact layout without one adds real friction, while someone who never touches the number pad gains meaningful desk space and a shorter reach to the mouse with a smaller layout.\n\nCheck the specific layout size and key count against your actual daily workflow, not just desk space alone."

The Logitech MX Keys S and MX Keys Mini use low-profile scissor switches, not mechanical ones, and are included because they're genuinely among the quietest keyboards available, not because they match the mechanical keyboard label.",

  {
    q: "What actually makes a keyboard quiet, the switch or something else?",
    a: "Two separate things contribute. A silent switch dampens the internal stem noise on the way down, while a low-profile switch is quieter mainly because it has shorter travel, less distance for the keycap to fall before striking the plate. Neither one eliminates the keycap-on-plate bottom-out thud entirely, which is why a desk mat under the keyboard helps regardless of switch type.",

    q: "Will a quiet mechanical keyboard still be picked up by my microphone on video calls?",

    q: "Is a tactile brown switch quiet enough for an open-plan office?",
    a: "It's quieter than a clicky blue switch but louder than a true silent or low-profile switch. In a private office it's usually fine, but in an open-plan layout with a coworker sitting within a meter or two, a low-profile mechanical pick or a scissor-switch board like the MX Keys S will draw less attention.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mod any of these keyboards with foam to reduce noise further?",
    a: "Not the picks in this list. Foam case modding, stuffing sound-absorbing foam inside the case to reduce hollow resonance, only works on hot-swappable keyboards with an accessible internal case, and none of the boards here are built that way. If deep noise customization matters to you, that's a reason to look at a separate hot-swappable mechanical board instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick is best if I want a genuinely mechanical keyboard on a tight budget?",
    a: "The Keychron B6 Pro at $38.24 is the cheapest true mechanical pick in this list, and it's specifically marketed and tuned for quiet typing with a full-size layout including a number pad. The Keychron C2 is a close second at $43.31 if you don't mind a wired-only connection.",
