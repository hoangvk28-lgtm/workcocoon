export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's 140W Charging Spec May Be Dynamically Shared Rather Than a Fixed, Always-Available Figure",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN pick specifically discloses that its 140W is dynamically allocated to charge laptops or power multiple other devices, meaning the full 140W may not always reach your laptop if several other power-hungry accessories are drawing from the same pool simultaneously. This matters significantly if you plan to connect many powered peripherals alongside your laptop and need guaranteed full-speed charging at all times, and matters less if your laptop is usually the only device drawing meaningful power from the dock. Look for language specifically distinguishing sustained versus dynamically shared power delivery, and check the included power supply's total wattage relative to the dock's combined charging claims across all ports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Included Power Supply's Total Wattage Reveals Whether a Dock Can Truly Sustain Its Charging Claims",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit TS5 pick's 240W power supply, well above its 140W host charging figure, provides real headroom to sustain full charging across all 15 ports simultaneously, while a dock with a power supply rated closer to its single charging claim has less real buffer for simultaneous multi-device use. This matters if you're connecting numerous devices and want confidence that full charging performance holds up under real load, and matters less for a lighter single-laptop setup. Compare a dock's stated power supply wattage against its total charging claims across all ports combined, not just its single headline laptop-charging figure, to judge how much real headroom it actually has."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PD 3.1 vs PD 3.0 Compatibility Can Determine Whether You Actually Get the Full 140W Advertised",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick specifically states its upstream port delivers up to 140W to a PD 3.1 laptop, but drops to up to 100W on a PD 3.0 laptop, a real 40W difference depending entirely on which USB Power Delivery revision your specific laptop supports. This matters if your laptop is a few years old and may only support the earlier PD 3.0 standard, since you could be leaving real charging speed on the table without realizing it. Check your exact laptop's supported USB Power Delivery revision (PD 3.0 versus PD 3.1) before assuming you'll receive a dock's full advertised wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless Cooling Trades Long-Term Silent Reliability for Potentially Less Headroom Under Sustained Heavy Load",
    "explanation": "The OWC pick's fanless aluminum enclosure keeps operation quiet with no moving parts that could eventually wear out or fail, a real long-term reliability and noise advantage over an actively cooled dock, though fanless designs generally have less thermal headroom for sustained maximum-load operation than a dock with active cooling. This matters if you value silent operation in a quiet home office and don't run the dock at peak load for extended hours, and matters less if you're running demanding, sustained multi-display workloads that generate more heat. Weigh a fanless design's quiet reliability against an actively-cooled dock's potentially higher sustained performance headroom based on your actual real-world usage pattern."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Third-Party Editorial Awards Can Be a Useful, Verifiable Signal Distinct From a Manufacturer's Own Marketing Claims",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick specifically cites a MacWorld Best of 2026 award and a PCWorld Editors' Choice badge, both real, independently verifiable third-party recognitions rather than a manufacturer's own self-awarded marketing language, giving a buyer an additional, more objective data point beyond the listing's own feature claims. This matters if you want independent validation before trusting a manufacturer's own performance and reliability claims, and matters less if you're comfortable evaluating the raw spec sheet on its own merits. Look for specifically named, verifiable third-party editorial recognitions rather than vague phrases like 'award-winning' with no named source, publication, or year attached."

  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when shopping for a 140W Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming every dock's 140W charging figure is a fixed, always-available number, when many docks specifically disclose that this power is dynamically shared with other connected devices rather than reserved exclusively for the laptop." },
  { "q": "Is the OWC Thunderbolt 5 Hub worth it if I need more ports than it offers?", "a": "If you need extensive additional ports beyond charging and basic connectivity, the UGREEN or CalDigit picks in this comparison offer significantly more total connectivity, but if your needs are minimal, the OWC hub's lower price and genuine 140W charging make it a strong value." },
  { "q": "Will I get the full 140W on the Plugable dock with an older laptop?", "a": "Only if your laptop specifically supports USB Power Delivery 3.1; the Plugable listing states PD 3.0 laptops are limited to up to 100W instead of the full 140W, so checking your laptop's exact PD revision before buying is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Can I daisy chain other devices off these docks while still charging my laptop at 140W?", "a": "The OWC Thunderbolt 5 Hub specifically supports three separate daisy chains of devices, even bus-powered ones, while still delivering its rated 140W laptop charging, though very heavy simultaneous daisy-chain use could interact with dynamically allocated power on some other docks." },
  { "q": "Does a fanless dock like the OWC Hub overheat under heavy use?", "a": "The OWC listing specifically describes a fanless aluminum enclosure designed for quiet and cool operation, though as with any fanless design, very sustained heavy multi-device or multi-display use may have less thermal headroom than an actively cooled dock." }
