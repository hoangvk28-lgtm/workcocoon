      "The AULA F75 Pro sits in the this comparison's price range tier and adds features that are genuinely rare at this price, hot-swappable sockets, pre-lubed switches from the factory, and a rotary knob for volume control. Pre-lubing at this price point is a real differentiator since budget hot-swap sockets can otherwise develop loose contact or bent pins after a few switch swaps. It connects over 2.4GHz, USB-C, or Bluetooth 5.0, giving it more flexibility than most budget boards that only offer one connection type. The 75% layout keeps arrow keys and a few navigation keys while trimming the numpad, a smaller learning curve than a 60% board if you're used to a full-size layout. 3 connection modes in one board. That's a real strength, but weigh it against the flip side: above the tier, closer to the ceiling.",

      "The Logitech G413 SE is the cheaper of these 2 picks and the only one under the line, a solid full-size mechanical board from an established brand with a track record for firmware and driver support that smaller budget brands often can't match. That established support matters more than it sounds, community and proprietary software from lesser-known brands is frequently abandoned after a couple of years, while Logitech's software footprint has stayed maintained for years. It is wired only and does not offer hot-swap sockets, so the switches are fixed for the life of the board, a tradeoff worth knowing if you want to experiment with switch feel later. In exchange, you get a full numpad and dedicated arrow keys with zero learning curve if you're moving from any standard full-size keyboard. Worth calling out specifically: full-size layout, no learning curve for numpad users. The catch is no hot-swap sockets, switches are fixed.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match switch type to your actual environment, not just gaming feel",
    "explanation": "Switch type determines feel, sound, and how disruptive the keyboard is to people around you, clicky switches feel satisfying to type on solo but produce an audible click on every keystroke that can be genuinely disruptive on a Zoom call or in a shared office, while linear switches are quieter and smoother, and tactile switches split the difference with a felt bump but no click.\n\nThis matters directly based on where you'll actually use the keyboard, a home office with video calls or a shared workspace calls for a different switch than a private gaming setup where clicky feedback is a feature, not a liability.\n\nCheck the specific switch name (not just \"mechanical\") and look up its actuation force and whether it's linear, tactile, or clicky before assuming any mechanical keyboard suits your environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check hot-swappable sockets if you want to change switches later without soldering",
    "explanation": "A hot-swappable keyboard lets you physically remove and replace individual switches without any soldering, meaning you can try different switch types or replace a failed switch years later without needing to be a hobbyist with a soldering iron.\n\nThis matters directly if you're not fully certain which switch feel you'll prefer long-term, or if you want the option to upgrade switches later without replacing the whole keyboard.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"hot-swappable\" and the specific socket type (3-pin or 5-pin) it supports, since not every hot-swap socket accepts every switch type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider keycap material for both feel and long-term durability",
    "explanation": "Keycap material affects both the tactile feel under your fingers and how well the keycaps resist shine and wear over years of typing, PBT plastic is generally more durable and resists the glossy shine that ABS plastic keycaps develop after months of oil and friction from typing.\n\nThis matters more for a keyboard you'll type on daily for years, less for occasional or gaming-only use where keycap longevity matters less.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for PBT versus ABS keycap material, since this detail is sometimes buried in the specs rather than featured prominently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless convenience against connection latency for your actual use case",
    "explanation": "A wireless mechanical keyboard eliminates a desk cable but introduces a small amount of input latency compared to a wired connection, and Bluetooth in particular can have more noticeable latency than a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver, a real consideration for competitive gaming but largely unnoticeable for typing and general office work.\n\nThis matters more if you're specifically buying for fast-paced gaming, less for typing-focused office or home use where the latency difference is imperceptible.\n\nCheck whether a wireless keyboard supports a low-latency 2.4GHz dongle in addition to Bluetooth, and consider a wired connection specifically if competitive gaming performance matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match keyboard layout and size to your actual desk space and workflow",
    "explanation": "Mechanical keyboards range from full-size boards with a number pad to compact tenkeyless (no number pad) and even smaller 60% layouts that omit the function row and arrow keys, and this size choice is a real tradeoff between desk space saved and keys available without a modifier combination.\n\nThis matters directly if you regularly use a number pad for data entry, a compact layout without one adds real friction, while someone who never touches the number pad gains meaningful desk space and a shorter reach to the mouse with a smaller layout.\n\nCheck the specific layout size and key count against your actual daily workflow, not just desk space alone."

  {
    q: "Why are there only 2 picks in this budget mechanical keyboard guide?",
    a: "We checked all 8 candidate listings under the mechanical keyboard cheap search against their real Amazon titles and descriptions. Several were membrane keyboards mislabeled as mechanical, and several others were ergonomic split or wave keyboards rather than standard mechanical boards. Only 2 were genuinely mechanical and verifiably priced under $100, so we kept the guide honest rather than padding it with mismatched products.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if a cheap mechanical keyboard listing is actually membrane?",
    a: "Check the switch specification in the listing itself, not just the title. Terms like membrane, rubber dome, or scissor switch in the description mean it isn't mechanical, even if mechanical appears in the product title. Both picks in this list explicitly specify true mechanical switches in their listings.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a $56 mechanical keyboard actually worth it, or should I spend more?",
    a: "The roughly $60 tier, like the Logitech G413 SE, typically gets solid full-size functionality and established brand software support, but skips hot-swap sockets and wireless. The $80 to $100 tier, like the AULA F75 Pro, adds hot-swap and multiple wireless modes. The extra $20 to $40 is worth it mainly if you want to experiment with switches or need wireless.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is stabilizer rattle and should I worry about it on a budget board?",
    a: "Stabilizer rattle is a loose, clicky feel on the spacebar and enter key caused by unlubricated stabilizers, and it's a very common complaint at the budget tier. It's fixable with stabilizer lubing, a modding step, so factor that into your decision if you're not willing to open the board and lube the stabilizers yourself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does hot-swap mean I can change switches on any budget mechanical keyboard?",
    a: "Only if the listing explicitly says hot-swappable, like the AULA F75 Pro. A board without hot-swap sockets, like the Logitech G413 SE, has switches soldered directly to the board, meaning switch changes would require desoldering rather than a simple swap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do budget wireless mechanical keyboards have a lower polling rate than premium ones?",
    a: "Often yes. Budget wireless keyboards commonly poll at 125Hz or 250Hz, while premium wireless boards can reach up to 1000Hz for 1ms response. This mostly matters for competitive gaming rather than typing, and polling rate isn't always disclosed in budget listings, so check the specs closely if gaming responsiveness matters to you.",
