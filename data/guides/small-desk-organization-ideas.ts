    a: "Start by removing everything and keeping only daily-use items on the surface. Add vertical storage (shelf riser or pegboard) above and hidden storage (under-desk drawers, cable tray) below. Finish with a 2-minute daily reset habit to prevent clutter from returning.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you organize a small desk with no drawers?",
    a: "Create your own drawer system using adhesive under-desk drawers ($12–$22) or stackable plastic drawer units placed under the desk. Pair with a cable management tray to remove the power strip from the surface. This combination gives a basic tabletop the storage of a full desk.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I keep a small desk clean?",
    a: "The end-of-day reset is the most effective method: spend 2 minutes before closing your laptop returning every item to its assigned place. This single habit prevents clutter from accumulating and makes every other organization method sustainable.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I put on a small desk?",
    a: "Only items you use daily: laptop or monitor, keyboard, mouse, one pen or pen cup, and your phone. Everything else should live near the desk (on shelves, in drawers, on the wall) - not on the surface. A desk mat and one compact organizer are the only accessories that earn permanent surface placement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I organize a small desk for studying?",
    a: "Use a monitor riser to create shelf space for textbooks, a desk mat to define your active study zone, and a compact organizer for pens and highlighters. Keep only the current subject's materials on the desk - store everything else on a nearby shelf. A flip Pomodoro timer ($18–$28) helps maintain focus sessions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How to organize a small office desk at work?",
    a: "Apply the zone system: active work in the center, one organizer on the side, reference materials above or behind. Add stackable paper trays (inbox/outbox) if your job involves physical documents. Keep personal items to one small area and enforce the one-bin rule for supplies.",
