    "title": "PoE Power Budget",

export const howToChoose: HowToChooseSection[] = [
  {
    "subheading": "Is Gigabit Still Enough in 2026?",
    "intro": "For most home networks, yes. Gigabit only becomes a bottleneck if you're transferring large files to a local NAS faster than 125MB/s or running several simultaneous 4K/8K streams over wired connections on the same switch."
  },
  {
    "subheading": "When to Consider Multi-Gig Instead",
    "note": "If your NAS, most of your devices, and your router or mesh system already support 2.5G or faster, a multi-gig switch is worth the premium. Otherwise a Gigabit switch performs identically for a lower price."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Port count is a headroom decision, not a current-need one",
    "explanation": "Buy for what you'll plug in over the next 2-3 years, not just today. An 8-port switch that's already full the day it arrives means buying a second switch and daisy-chaining, which adds a hop of latency and another point of failure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE budget is a shared pool, not per-port",
    "explanation": "A switch rated for 8 PoE+ ports at 120W total does not mean every port gets 30W simultaneously. Add up the real draw of every camera, AP, and phone you'll connect, and make sure the total budget clears it with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Managed vs unmanaged changes what you can diagnose later",
    "explanation": "An unmanaged switch is zero-configuration but gives you no visibility when something goes wrong. A smart-managed switch adds VLANs, port mirroring, and traffic monitoring for a modest price increase, worth it the first time you need to isolate a misbehaving device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless does not always mean silent under load",
    "explanation": "Most desktop switches are genuinely fanless and silent, but high-port-count PoE switches sometimes add active cooling once the power budget climbs past 200-300W. Check for a fan explicitly if a quiet office or bedroom install matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speed needs matching cable and network gear",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G or 10G switch only delivers those speeds if your cabling is Cat5e or better (Cat6a for 10G) and the devices on both ends actually support that speed. Mixing a multi-gig switch into an all-Gigabit network gets you nothing extra."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Renewed enterprise gear needs a licensing check first",
    "explanation": "Cisco Meraki, Juniper, and some Aruba/HPE switches on Amazon are frequently sold as renewed hardware without an active license or support contract. Confirm what functions before assuming a discounted enterprise switch works like a new one out of the box."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is Gigabit Ethernet fast enough for gaming?",
    "a": "Yes, comfortably. Online gaming needs low latency far more than high bandwidth, and a wired Gigabit connection typically adds under 1ms of switch latency, well below what matters for competitive play."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do all the ports on a Gigabit switch run at full speed simultaneously?",
    "a": "On a properly rated switch, yes, check the switching capacity spec (e.g., a 24-port Gigabit switch needs at least 48Gbps to run every port at full duplex simultaneously without oversubscription)."
