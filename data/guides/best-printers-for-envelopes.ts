    "explanation": "Listings for a printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Why does my printer keep jamming on envelopes?",
    a: "Envelope jamming is almost always caused by loading the flap in the wrong direction or forcing an envelope through a feed path built for flat paper. Check the small diagram near the paper tray or in the printer manual, and always print one test envelope before a full batch to confirm the orientation is correct.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to adjust my printer's settings to print on envelopes?",
    a: "Yes, most printers need a manual offset adjustment in the driver settings the first time you print an address on an envelope, since default margins are calibrated for standard letter paper. Print a test envelope first to catch a misaligned address before running a full mailing batch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which printer is best for invitation-size envelopes like A2 or A7?",
    a: "None of the printers in this list explicitly guarantee A2 or A7 invitation-size support in their listed specs, so verify directly against the manufacturer's spec sheet before ordering invitation stationery in bulk. Standard #10 business envelope support is common across all 8 picks here.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is laser or inkjet better for printing envelopes?",
    a: "Laser toner resists smudging better if an envelope gets slightly damp during mailing or handling, making it a stronger choice for important business mail, as with the Brother DCP-L2640DW or HL-L2405W. Inkjet, like the Canon PIXMA picks, is a better fit if you want color addressing or decorative invitation printing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can these printers feed multiple envelopes automatically?",
    a: "No, none of the printers in this list are built for automatic multi-envelope feeding. Expect to load and print envelopes one at a time, which is fine for personal mailing but worth planning extra time for if you're mailing a large batch of business envelopes.",
