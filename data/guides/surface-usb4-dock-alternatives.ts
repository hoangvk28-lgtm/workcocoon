export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Microsoft's Designed for Surface Certification Is a Verifiable Standard, Not Just Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "The Kensington SD5750T specifically states it was developed in direct collaboration with Microsoft under their Designed for Surface certification program, a formal validation process that differs meaningfully from a manufacturer simply claiming 'Surface compatible' without that certification. This matters if compatibility assurance is your top priority when replacing the official Microsoft dock, and matters less if you're comfortable relying on a broader USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 standard without formal Surface-specific certification. Check specifically for the Designed for Surface certification badge or explicit mention in a listing, rather than assuming any dock claiming 'Surface compatible' has gone through the same formal validation process."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Daisy Chain Support Lets You Expand Beyond the Dock's Built-In Ports Without a Second Dock",
    "explanation": "The Kensington SD5750T specifically supports daisy chaining up to five Thunderbolt devices total through its unused Thunderbolt ports, letting you connect additional Thunderbolt peripherals like external drives or a second monitor in a chain rather than needing every device to plug directly into the dock itself. This matters if you have more Thunderbolt peripherals than the dock's direct ports can accommodate, and matters less if your peripheral count comfortably fits within the dock's built-in ports. Check whether a dock specifically states daisy chain support and the maximum number of chained devices before assuming any Thunderbolt port can be extended this way."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Maximum Display Resolution Often Depends on Which Operating System and Chip You're Using",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit TS4 specifically states that Windows users can connect a single 8K display or dual 4K 60Hz monitors, while Mac support varies by chip generation, with M1 through M3 non-Pro Macs limited to a single display due to host hardware limitations rather than any fault of the dock itself. This matters directly if you're evaluating a dock's display specs against your specific device and chip generation, not just its general marketing claim, and matters less if you already know your exact device's display output limits. Check a dock's platform-specific display support notes (Windows versus Mac, and specific chip generations) rather than assuming its single headline display spec applies universally to every device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Compact, Bag-Friendly Hub Trades Maximum Port Count for Genuine Portability, Not a Downgrade in Core Speed",
    "explanation": "The Kensington MD120U4 delivers the same genuine 40Gbps USB4 upstream speed as the larger desk-anchored docks in this comparison, but in a compact form factor specifically designed to fit in a backpack or carrying case, meaning you're not sacrificing core data speed just because the hub is smaller and more portable. This matters if you regularly move between locations and want consistent dock functionality without carrying a bulky desk dock, and matters less if the dock lives permanently at one desk. Check whether a compact hub's stated core bandwidth matches larger docks' figures before assuming smaller automatically means slower."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Intel VT-d DMA Protection Is a Real Security Feature Worth Checking For in a Shared or Corporate Environment",
    "explanation": "The Kensington SD5760T specifically states it uses Intel VT-d DMA protection to block peripheral devices from unauthorized access to your system memory, a genuine hardware-level security feature that protects against a specific class of attack involving malicious peripherals, not every dock in this comparison discloses this protection. This matters more in corporate or shared-device environments where unknown peripherals might connect to the dock, and matters less on a personal device where you control every peripheral that ever connects. Check whether a listing specifically discloses DMA protection or similar hardware security features if your dock will be used in a shared or higher-security environment."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need Microsoft's Designed for Surface certification if I'm not using the very latest Surface model?", "a": "Checking the specific certification's stated compatible Surface Pro and Laptop generations is worth doing, since a certification badge typically lists exact supported models rather than covering every Surface generation automatically." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an alternative to the official Surface dock?", "a": "Choosing a generic USB-C dock with no Surface-specific validation or certification purely based on price, then encountering display detection or charging quirks that a Microsoft-certified or Surface-tested alternative would have avoided." },
  { "q": "Is the CalDigit TS4 worth choosing over the Kensington SD5750T if I only use Surface devices?", "a": "If you exclusively use Surface hardware, the Kensington SD5750T's actual Microsoft certification offers stronger compatibility assurance, but if you also regularly use other Thunderbolt or USB-C laptops, the CalDigit TS4's genuinely universal compatibility and higher port count may serve you better overall." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the Kensington MD120U4 hub will support dual monitors with my specific laptop?", "a": "The listing specifically states dual 4K@120Hz support for Windows and Samsung DeX devices but limits MacBooks to a single 4K@60Hz display, so checking your specific device type against these platform-specific limits is worth doing before purchase." },
  { "q": "Can I use these dock alternatives with a non-Surface Windows laptop as well?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison support broader Thunderbolt 4, Thunderbolt 3, USB4, or USB-C compatibility beyond just Surface devices, making them usable with most modern Windows laptops and many MacBook models." },
  { "q": "Do any of these alternatives include the software tools Kensington offers with its docks?", "a": "The Kensington SD5760T specifically includes free DockWorks software for connection, performance, and security management, while checking whether similar management software is available for other picks is worth doing if that's a priority for your setup." }
