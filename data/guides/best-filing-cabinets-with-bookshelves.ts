  "A combo unit that pairs filing drawers with open shelving sounds like the efficient answer for a small home office, but the real trade-off rarely gets spelled out: combo units almost always give up filing capacity to make room for shelves. A dedicated cabinet might offer four full drawers, while a filing-and-bookshelf combo often has only one or two, with the rest of the height given over to open storage. Shelf load capacity is another detail worth checking, since a full run of hardcover books can weigh more than the 25 to 50 pound rating some open shelves carry.",
  "This guide compares 6 units we evaluated based on product specs and buyer feedback, and we verified from each listing whether it genuinely includes open shelving or only a single internal storage shelf marketed loosely as bookshelf-adjacent. Prices range from $94.99 for a lateral cabinet with an adjustable shelf to $239.99 for a tall combo tower with three tiers of open shelving. Tall units in this category are also top-heavy by design, so anti-tip anchoring is a safety step worth taking seriously rather than skipping.",

At 72 inches tall, it is also the most top-heavy unit here, so anchoring it to the wall before loading the shelves is not optional.\n\nWith only 18 ratings, its feedback history is thin compared to other picks in this list, worth weighing against the fact that it is also the only unit offering three full shelf tiers rather than one or two.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual steel gauge, not just \"metal\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "A filing cabinet described as \"metal\" can still be built with a thin metal face over a particleboard or MDF core rather than genuine steel construction throughout, and even among fully steel cabinets, gauge thickness (a lower number means thicker, sturdier steel) varies meaningfully between products that look nearly identical in listing photos.\n\nThis matters directly for how the cabinet holds up to years of drawer use and how well it resists denting or flexing under a fully loaded drawer's weight.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated steel gauge number, and be skeptical of the word \"metal\" alone without a gauge figure or a clear description of full-steel versus metal-faced construction."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for full-extension versus partial-extension drawer slides",
    "explanation": "Full-extension drawer slides let a drawer pull completely out of the cabinet body, giving access to files at the very back, while partial-extension slides only pull the drawer out part way, leaving files at the rear harder to reach without leaning or reaching awkwardly into the cabinet.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot for daily usability, especially for a deep drawer holding hanging files toward the back, but rarely gets mentioned clearly in listing bullet points that focus on drawer count instead.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"full-extension\" language, and check reviews for mentions of how far drawers actually pull out in practice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm anti-tip safety features if you have kids, pets, or plan a fully loaded cabinet",
    "explanation": "A filing cabinet with multiple drawers can tip forward if more than one drawer is pulled open at once while loaded with paper, a real safety hazard, and better-designed cabinets include an anti-tip interlock mechanism that physically prevents opening a second drawer while another is already open.\n\nThis matters more in a household with kids or pets who might pull on drawers, or if you plan to keep the cabinet fully loaded with heavy paper files rather than lightly used.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated anti-tip or interlock safety feature, since this detail is frequently omitted from budget cabinet listings entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match hanging file compatibility to your actual folder sizes",
    "explanation": "Not every filing cabinet drawer accommodates both letter-size and legal-size hanging files, some are sized for letter only, and a drawer that looks roomy in a photo may not actually fit the wider legal-size folders many home offices and small businesses still use for certain documents.\n\nThis matters directly if any portion of your filing includes legal-size paperwork, buying based on drawer count or overall cabinet size alone without checking hanging-file compatibility is a common and easily avoidable mistake.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for stated letter and/or legal-size hanging file compatibility, not just the general drawer dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh assembly requirements and real delivered weight before ordering",
    "explanation": "Filing cabinets range from fully assembled units shipped ready to use to flat-packed kits requiring meaningful assembly time and, for a genuinely heavy steel cabinet, more than one person to safely maneuver into place.\n\nThis matters because assembly difficulty and real shipped weight are easy to underestimate from a product photo, and a fully assembled cabinet costs more but eliminates that setup friction and the risk of a DIY assembly not being as sturdy as a factory-built one.\n\nCheck the listing for whether the cabinet ships assembled or requires assembly, and check the stated shipping weight against how much lifting and maneuvering you're actually prepared to handle at delivery."

    q: "Is a filing-and-bookshelf combo actually good for storing a lot of books?",
    a: "Only within its stated shelf load limit, typically 25 to 50 pounds per shelf in this category. A full shelf of hardcover books can approach that limit fast, so check the stated capacity rather than assuming a shelf described as sturdy can hold an unlimited load.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do combo units have fewer drawers than dedicated filing cabinets?",
    a: "Most combo units in this category dedicate part of their height to open shelving, leaving room for only 1 to 2 drawers versus 3 to 5 on dedicated filing cabinets. This is a real trade-off, not a manufacturing shortcut, so weigh how much filing capacity you actually need before choosing a combo unit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I really need to anchor a tall filing-and-bookshelf combo to the wall?",
    a: "Yes, if it is 60 inches or taller, like the NORTHSKY 72-inch model in this list. Loading upper shelves with books shifts weight higher up the unit, increasing tip risk, and anti-tip anchoring is the same safety step recommended for any tall bookshelf or dresser.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a genuine open shelf and a single adjustable shelf?",
    a: "A genuine open shelf design, like the NORTHSKY or SISESOL picks in this list, includes multiple tiers of visible, accessible storage built into the unit's structure. A single adjustable shelf, like the one in the SEDETA or DEVAISE picks, is one internal shelf you can reposition, closer to a filing cabinet with a bonus shelf than a true bookshelf.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy wood or metal for a filing-and-bookshelf combo?",
    a: "Metal holds up better in humid basements or un-air-conditioned rooms, since wood and wood-composite bodies can warp or swell over time in damp conditions. Wood finishes like the SEDETA farmhouse style are fine in a climate-controlled home office.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it better to just buy a separate filing cabinet and bookshelf instead of a combo?",
    a: "If filing capacity matters more to you than saving floor space, yes. A dedicated 4-drawer cabinet like the Letaya 4 Drawer Lateral paired with a standalone bookshelf will out-perform any combo unit on both filing volume and shelf capacity, at the cost of using two pieces of furniture instead of one.",
