Scheduling the backup is the easy part; keeping it running unattended for years is what separates a good pick from a frustrating one.",

    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

  {
    q: "Will my Mac backups stop working because of AFP being removed?",
    a: "If your NAS firmware only advertises AFP for Time Machine, yes, backups will silently stop working once your Mac updates past macOS 27. Before buying or updating, confirm the NAS is configured for SMB3 with Bonjour/mDNS advertising the Time Machine service, which is the protocol combination Apple is standardizing on.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much usable storage do I actually get in RAID 1?",
    a: "RAID 1 mirrors your data across two drives, so two 4TB drives give you 4TB of usable, protected space rather than the combined 8TB. If you need more usable capacity with redundancy, a 4-bay NAS in RAID 5 gives you roughly 75% of total raw capacity instead of 50%.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use Active Backup for Business or Time Machine on a Synology NAS?",
    a: "Active Backup for Business is the better choice for backing up multiple PCs and Macs with full-image, deduplicated backups, and it's the stronger option for IT-style management. Time Machine on the NAS is simpler and more tightly integrated for a single home Mac user who just wants the native macOS backup experience.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I still need cloud backup if I have a NAS?",
    a: "Yes. A NAS covers the local backup leg of the 3-2-1 rule, 3 copies of your data across 2 media types with 1 copy offsite, but it doesn't protect against fire, theft, or a ransomware attack that reaches your home network. Pair local NAS backup with a cloud destination for anything you can't afford to lose.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if my backup is actually working, not just scheduled?",
    a: "A scheduled job can run for months while quietly failing to produce a restorable backup due to RAID errors or file corruption. Periodically, at least quarterly, restore a real file or folder from the backup to confirm it's actually usable, rather than trusting the scheduler's success notification alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 2-bay NAS enough for backing up 2 computers?",
    a: "Yes, for 2 computers with typical document and photo backup needs, a 2-bay NAS like the Synology DS223 works well as long as you set a quota per computer so one machine's backup history doesn't consume the whole array. For 3 or more computers, or heavier media backup, a 4-bay with more RAM handles concurrent jobs more comfortably.",
