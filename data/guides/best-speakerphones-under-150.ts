export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Daisy Chain Scaling Numbers Represent Best-Case Attendee Counts, Not Guaranteed Room Performance",
    "explanation": "Stated attendee capacities like the Yealink SP96's coverage doubling to 40 square meters or the EMEET M3's support for up to 20 attendees with daisy chain assume relatively favorable room acoustics and optimal unit placement, not a worst-case scenario with hard surfaces or unusual room shapes. This matters because a genuinely large or acoustically difficult room might need daisy chaining even below the stated single-unit capacity to maintain clear pickup for everyone. Measure your actual room's square footage and consider its acoustic properties, carpeted versus hard flooring, high ceilings versus standard, before assuming a stated capacity number applies directly to your specific space."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An IP Rating Like IP64 Is a Specific, Testable Standard, Not a Marketing Buzzword for General Durability",
    "explanation": "The Poly Sync 20's IP64 rating is an internationally recognized ingress protection standard where the first digit indicates dust resistance and the second indicates water resistance, meaning this device has been specifically tested against dust ingress and water splashing from any direction, a concrete claim that 'durable' or 'rugged' language alone doesn't provide. This matters if your speakerphone will regularly be near a coffee station, in a warehouse setting, or transported frequently where incidental exposure is more likely. Look for an explicit IP rating number in the listing rather than accepting general durability language, since IP64 specifically means something different from an unrated 'water-resistant' claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voice Level Normalization Technology Solves a Real Problem in Rooms With Uneven Seating Distances",
    "explanation": "The Jabra Speak2 55's voice level normalization automatically adjusts for the natural volume differences between someone sitting close to the speakerphone versus someone seated farther away, evening out the call experience for remote participants who would otherwise hear some voices much louder than others. This matters specifically in larger or irregularly shaped rooms where seating distance from the unit varies significantly, less so in a small, evenly arranged room where everyone sits roughly the same distance away. Check the listing specifically for terms like 'voice normalization' or 'automatic volume balancing' if your typical meeting room has uneven seating arrangements."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Official Platform Recognition, Like Zoom's Compatible Voice Partner Status, Differs From Basic Certification",
    "explanation": "The EMEET M3's specific recognition by Zoom as an official compatible voice partner on Zoom's own website is a distinct form of endorsement from a general 'works with Zoom' compatibility claim, since it indicates Zoom itself has reviewed and listed the product rather than the manufacturer simply asserting compatibility. This matters if procurement decisions in your organization specifically check a platform's own hardware compatibility list rather than relying on manufacturer claims alone. Verify a stated platform partnership or certification against that platform's own published compatible-hardware list if this level of verification matters for your purchase decision."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery Life Figures at This Tier Should Be Checked Against Your Actual Meeting Schedule, Not Just Compared as Numbers",
    "explanation": "The battery life figures in this tier range from 12 hours on the Jabra Speak2 55 up to over 18 hours on the EMEET M3 and 26 hours on the Yealink SP96, and the practical difference matters less if your unit stays plugged in most of the time and matters considerably more if it's genuinely used cordlessly across a full day of back-to-back meetings. This is worth calculating against your actual weekly meeting load rather than assuming more hours is always meaningfully better if the device rarely leaves a desk with power nearby. Estimate your typical daily or weekly cordless usage hours before treating battery life as a primary deciding factor over other features that might matter more for your specific use case."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the Yealink SP96's daisy chain feature connect to a different brand's speakerphone?", "a": "No, daisy chain compatibility in this tier is manufacturer-specific, so the Yealink SP96 only links with other compatible Yealink units, and similarly the EMEET M3 only links with other EMEET daisy chain compatible models." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a speakerphone for a large conference room at this tier?", "a": "Assuming a single unit's stated attendee capacity holds true regardless of room shape or acoustics, when a genuinely large or acoustically challenging room may need daisy chaining even below the stated single-unit maximum to maintain reliable pickup for everyone." },
  { "q": "Is the Yealink SP96 worth it over the cheaper Poly Sync 20?", "a": "If you specifically need 8-12 person conference room coverage with daisy chain expansion, yes, but if you want strong battery life and durability for personal portable use, the Poly Sync 20 covers that for about $18 less." },
  { "q": "Does the Jabra Speak2 55's Teams certification limit it from working with other platforms like Zoom?", "a": "No, it works with Zoom and Google Meet in addition to its formal Microsoft Teams certification, so certification for one platform doesn't restrict compatibility with others." },
  { "q": "How does the Poly Sync 20's IP64 rating hold up against a full spill, not just splashes?", "a": "IP64 specifically covers protection against dust ingress and water splashed from any direction, but it's not rated for submersion or a direct pour, so treating it as spill-resistant rather than fully waterproof is the accurate expectation." },
  { "q": "Can the EMEET M3 be used for a small 2-3 person call, or is it overkill for that?", "a": "It works fine for smaller calls too, since its automatic volume balancing and noise reduction still apply, though you're paying for large-room capacity you won't be using if your calls are consistently small." }
