export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match switch type to your actual environment, not just gaming feel",
    "explanation": "Switch type determines feel, sound, and how disruptive the keyboard is to people around you, clicky switches feel satisfying to type on solo but produce an audible click on every keystroke that can be genuinely disruptive on a Zoom call or in a shared office, while linear switches are quieter and smoother, and tactile switches split the difference with a felt bump but no click.\n\nThis matters directly based on where you'll actually use the keyboard, a home office with video calls or a shared workspace calls for a different switch than a private gaming setup where clicky feedback is a feature, not a liability.\n\nCheck the specific switch name (not just \"mechanical\") and look up its actuation force and whether it's linear, tactile, or clicky before assuming any mechanical keyboard suits your environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check hot-swappable sockets if you want to change switches later without soldering",
    "explanation": "A hot-swappable keyboard lets you physically remove and replace individual switches without any soldering, meaning you can try different switch types or replace a failed switch years later without needing to be a hobbyist with a soldering iron.\n\nThis matters directly if you're not fully certain which switch feel you'll prefer long-term, or if you want the option to upgrade switches later without replacing the whole keyboard.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"hot-swappable\" and the specific socket type (3-pin or 5-pin) it supports, since not every hot-swap socket accepts every switch type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider keycap material for both feel and long-term durability",
    "explanation": "Keycap material affects both the tactile feel under your fingers and how well the keycaps resist shine and wear over years of typing, PBT plastic is generally more durable and resists the glossy shine that ABS plastic keycaps develop after months of oil and friction from typing.\n\nThis matters more for a keyboard you'll type on daily for years, less for occasional or gaming-only use where keycap longevity matters less.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for PBT versus ABS keycap material, since this detail is sometimes buried in the specs rather than featured prominently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless convenience against connection latency for your actual use case",
    "explanation": "A wireless mechanical keyboard eliminates a desk cable but introduces a small amount of input latency compared to a wired connection, and Bluetooth in particular can have more noticeable latency than a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver, a real consideration for competitive gaming but largely unnoticeable for typing and general office work.\n\nThis matters more if you're specifically buying for fast-paced gaming, less for typing-focused office or home use where the latency difference is imperceptible.\n\nCheck whether a wireless keyboard supports a low-latency 2.4GHz dongle in addition to Bluetooth, and consider a wired connection specifically if competitive gaming performance matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match keyboard layout and size to your actual desk space and workflow",
    "explanation": "Mechanical keyboards range from full-size boards with a number pad to compact tenkeyless (no number pad) and even smaller 60% layouts that omit the function row and arrow keys, and this size choice is a real tradeoff between desk space saved and keys available without a modifier combination.\n\nThis matters directly if you regularly use a number pad for data entry, a compact layout without one adds real friction, while someone who never touches the number pad gains meaningful desk space and a shorter reach to the mouse with a smaller layout.\n\nCheck the specific layout size and key count against your actual daily workflow, not just desk space alone."

    q: "Will an older Mac have Bluetooth pairing problems with these keyboards?",
    a: "It's possible with pre-2017 Mac models, which run older Bluetooth versions than some newer keyboards expect. If you're on an older Mac, favor a pick with a wired or 2.4GHz USB receiver fallback, like the Keychron C2, K4, K3 V2, K2 HE, V6 Max, or K10 HE, rather than a Bluetooth-only keyboard.",

  {
    q: "Do Hall effect keyboards work differently on Apple Silicon versus Intel Macs?",
    a: "Browser-based configuration tools for Hall effect keyboards like the K2 HE and K10 HE generally work the same on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Some manufacturer desktop configurator apps have had less consistent support across the two architectures, so check current compatibility notes for your specific Mac chip if a keyboard relies on a native app rather than a browser tool.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a Mac-native keyboard worth the extra price over a cheaper cross-platform mechanical keyboard?",
    a: "It depends on how much setup friction you're willing to tolerate. The MX Mechanical Mini Mac costs more than the Keychron C2 or K4, but needs zero remapping. A cross-platform pick like the C2 costs less and works fine on Mac after a short Fn-row and modifier key adjustment in System Settings, a one-time setup that many Mac users don't mind.",
