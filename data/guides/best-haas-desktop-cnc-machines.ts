    description: "Repeatability accuracy of ±0.005mm and 6061 aluminum cutting accuracy of ±0.02mm are documented figures that put this ahead of AnoleX's own 3030-Evo Max on precision. HGH-15 dual linear rails with dual-bearing 1204 ball screws on every axis specifically target vibration reduction and stepper motor longevity.\n\nNema 23 stepper motors (2.8A, 1.2 N/m torque) give more headroom than the Nema17 motors common on this class of machine, with closed-loop interfaces for plug-and-play upgrades later. GRBL 1.3a firmware on the ESP32 board supports 4th-axis rotation, coolant control, and closed-loop stepper motors out of the box.",

The water cooling system automatically activates when the spindle starts, giving better heat dissipation and quieter operation than an air-cooled equivalent, particularly useful for longer machining runs.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are all haas desktop cnc machines products currently sold, or does the lineup include discontinued models?",
    "a": "Check current first-party store pages directly, since older models often stay heavily indexed in search results long after being discontinued or moved to support-only status."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does buying a well-known brand guarantee better build quality?",
    "a": "Not automatically. Brand lineups often span multiple hardware generations and price tiers, so verify the exact model's specs rather than assuming brand reputation alone predicts quality."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
