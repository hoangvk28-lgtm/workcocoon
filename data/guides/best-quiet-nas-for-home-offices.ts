Synology's DSM software also lets you schedule intensive tasks like backups for overnight hours when they're least disruptive.\n\nIt centralizes file backup, protects data, and can monitor a property, all from a compact enclosure suited to sitting on or near a desk. Since drive noise dominates over fan noise on any 2-bay unit, pairing it with quieter NAS-rated drives makes a bigger difference here than chasing a slightly lower fan dB rating alone.\n\nCan schedule noisy tasks like backups for off-hours.

    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "Are NAS noise ratings on the box accurate?",
    a: "Not for real-world use. Manufacturer dB ratings are almost always measured at idle with no drive activity. Once a backup job or RAID rebuild is running, fan speed increases and drives ramp up, so the actual noise at your desk is typically higher than the spec sheet number suggests.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the fan or the hard drives make more noise in a NAS?",
    a: "In most cases, the spinning hard drives make more noise than the fan. Modern NAS fans are generally well-tuned and quiet, while HDD mechanical hum and occasional seek clicks are usually the more noticeable source. An SSD-based setup like the Beelink ME Pro's M.2 slots removes that mechanical noise almost entirely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does where I put my NAS affect how loud it sounds?",
    a: "Yes, significantly. A NAS placed directly on a hollow wooden desk transmits vibration through the desk and sounds noticeably louder than the same unit on a solid surface. Adding rubber feet or a foam mounting pad under the unit reduces perceived noise at the listening point more than most people expect.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which NAS in this list is the quietest overall?",
    a: "The Beelink Mini PC ME Pro is the quietest when configured with M.2 SSDs instead of spinning hard drives, since SSD storage adds essentially zero mechanical noise. The tradeoff is a higher cost per TB and a lower practical capacity ceiling than a traditional multi-bay HDD NAS like the QNAP TR-004.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I worry more about NAS noise at night than during the day?",
    a: "Yes. A NAS near a bedroom or a quiet home office is far more noticeable overnight than the same unit running in a room with daytime ambient noise. If it sits close to where you sleep, schedule backups and RAID scrubs for daytime hours, or lean toward a genuinely low-noise, SSD-first setup like the Beelink ME Pro.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a fanless NAS handle a home office's storage needs?",
    a: "Fanless or near-silent NAS setups, typically built around low-power CPUs paired with M.2 SSDs, work well for buyers who don't need maximum capacity. The tradeoff is a higher cost per TB and a lower practical storage ceiling compared to a traditional multi-bay HDD NAS, so it suits lighter storage needs better than a media library that's still growing fast.",
