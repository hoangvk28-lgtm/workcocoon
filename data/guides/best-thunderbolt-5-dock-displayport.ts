export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A DisplayPort-Equipped Dock Doesn't Always Include the Actual DisplayPort Cable in the Box",
    "explanation": "The Dell Pro Bundle specifically advertises that its package includes a DisplayPort cable alongside HDMI and USB-C cables, an explicit inclusion that isn't guaranteed on every dock with a DisplayPort output, since many listings only confirm the port exists without confirming a matching cable ships with it. This matters if you don't already own a DisplayPort cable rated for the resolution and refresh rate you need, since discovering after purchase that you need to buy one separately adds real unplanned cost and delay. Check a dock's included-accessories list specifically for a named DisplayPort cable, rather than assuming the presence of a DisplayPort output means a cable is automatically included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A DisplayPort Output's Resolution Ceiling Can Genuinely Differ From the Same Dock's HDMI Output",
    "explanation": "The Sonnet Echo 20 pick specifically states its built-in outputs support up to 8K through HDMI but only up to 4K through DisplayPort, a real difference in maximum resolution between the two port types on the identical physical dock. This matters if you're specifically relying on the DisplayPort output for your primary monitor and assumed it would match the dock's headline 8K claim, since that claim may only apply to a different port on the same device. Check a dock's resolution specs broken down by exact port type, not just its single best-case headline resolution figure, if your monitor specifically connects via DisplayPort."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Mac-Optimized DisplayPort Dock May Not Deliver the Same Performance on a Windows Machine",
    "explanation": "The Kensington EQ Pro pick is specifically optimized for MacBook M-Series Pro, Max, and M4 chipsets, meaning its documented display specs and feature set are built around and tested for that specific platform rather than as a general cross-platform claim. This matters if you specifically use a MacBook Pro with a qualifying chip and want a dock tuned for that exact use case, and matters less or could even be a mismatch if you regularly switch to or also use a Windows machine. Check whether a dock's DisplayPort specs are stated for your specific platform, or whether the listing is Mac-optimized in a way that may not carry over identically to Windows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Independent Port Bandwidth Matters More When Running Multiple Different Display Connection Types Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick specifically supports DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C outputs independently and simultaneously, meaning connecting a monitor to each port type doesn't force a tradeoff or bandwidth-sharing compromise between them. This matters if you're running a mixed-monitor setup with different connection types (one DisplayPort monitor, one HDMI monitor), since a dock where these outputs aren't independent could force you to choose between them or accept reduced performance on one. Check whether a dock's multiple video output types are documented as working independently and simultaneously, rather than assuming any combination of ports will work together without compromise."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In Lockable Storage Slot Adds a Real Security Layer Beyond Just Storage Expansion",
    "explanation": "The Kensington EQ Pro pick's specifically lockable PCIe M.2 SSD slot adds a physical security layer that a standard, non-lockable SSD slot doesn't provide, meaning sensitive data on an installed drive is harder to physically remove without authorization. This matters if you're storing sensitive data on the dock's expansion storage in a shared or semi-public workspace, and matters less for a private home office where physical theft of an installed component isn't a real concern. Check whether a dock's storage expansion slot is specifically described as lockable if physical data security is a real consideration for your workspace."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do all Thunderbolt 5 docks with a DisplayPort output include the actual DisplayPort cable?", "a": "No, the Dell Pro Bundle specifically confirms an included DisplayPort cable, but other docks in this comparison don't make the same explicit inclusion claim, so checking the included-accessories list before assuming a cable ships in the box is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Thunderbolt 5 dock for DisplayPort output?", "a": "Assuming a dock's headline resolution figure applies equally across every port type, when DisplayPort and HDMI outputs on the same dock can have genuinely different resolution ceilings, as documented on the Sonnet Echo 20 pick." },
  { "q": "Is the Kensington EQ Pro worth it if I use a Windows laptop instead of a MacBook?", "a": "The Kensington EQ Pro is specifically optimized for MacBook M-Series Pro, Max, and M4 chipsets, so a Windows-focused buyer would likely get better documented cross-platform support from the StarTech or Dell picks in this comparison instead." },
  { "q": "Can I connect a DisplayPort monitor and an HDMI monitor to the same dock at the same time?", "a": "The StarTech pick specifically supports DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C outputs independently and simultaneously, making it a strong choice for exactly this kind of mixed-monitor setup." },
  { "q": "Does the Sonnet Echo 20's DisplayPort output support the same 8K resolution as its HDMI output?", "a": "No, the Sonnet Echo 20 listing specifically states its DisplayPort output supports up to 4K monitors while its HDMI output can reach up to 8K, a real difference worth checking if your monitor connects via DisplayPort specifically." },
  { "q": "Do I need to buy an SSD separately for the Kensington EQ Pro's storage slot?", "a": "Yes, the Kensington EQ Pro's built-in and lockable PCIe M.2 SSD slot is sold without the SSD itself, so you'll need to purchase a compatible drive separately to use that storage expansion feature." }
