  "A white TV stand can brighten a living room in a way wood tones and black finishes cannot, but not every white finish holds up the same way over time. Matte finishes resist scuffs and fingerprints better than high gloss, and solid or high-quality engineered wood resists yellowing from sunlight far better than cheap particleboard laminate.",
  "Before buying, think about how the white will sit against your existing furniture. A stark cool white can clash with warm wood tones elsewhere in the room, while a soft or off-white finish tends to blend more easily. The picks below cover farmhouse barn door styles, modern glass-shelf designs, and budget-friendly options across a range of TV sizes and storage needs.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand white often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand white holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand white over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand white you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand white that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Do white TV stands show scratches more than wood or black stands?", a: "Yes, generally. White surfaces make scuffs, scratches, and handprints more visible than darker wood grains or black finishes, which naturally camouflage minor wear. A matte white finish hides marks better than a glossy one, but based on product specs and buyer feedback, any white stand in a high-traffic living room will need more frequent wiping down than a dark wood equivalent." },
  { q: "Will a white TV stand yellow over time?", a: "Cheaper high-gloss white finishes are more prone to yellowing, particularly with prolonged direct sunlight exposure. Stands built from solid wood or higher-quality engineered wood with a proper sealed finish resist yellowing much better than thin laminate over particleboard. If your stand will sit near a sunny window, a matte or satin finish on quality engineered wood is the safer choice." },
  { q: "How do I match a white TV stand to warm wood furniture in the same room?", a: "Look for a warm or off-white finish rather than a stark, cool white if your room already has warm wood tones, beige walls, or cream furniture. Several stands in this roundup blend a white cabinet with visible wood-grain accents, which bridges the gap between all-white and all-wood rooms more naturally than a single stark white piece." },
  { q: "What size white TV stand do I need for a 65-inch TV?", a: "For a 65-inch TV, look for a stand in the 55 to 65 inch width range so the screen does not visually overhang the stand on both sides. Also confirm the stand's weight capacity comfortably exceeds your TV's actual weight, since most 65-inch TVs weigh between 35 and 55 lbs depending on the model." },
  { q: "Are sliding barn door TV stands harder to clean than regular cabinet doors?", a: "Not harder, but different. Barn door tracks can collect dust over time and need occasional wiping with a dry or slightly damp microfiber cloth, similar to any hardware track. Based on product specs and buyer feedback, metal door tracks tend to hold up better long-term than plastic rollers found on some budget barn door stands." },
  { q: "Can I put a small TV on a stand rated for a larger TV?", a: "Yes, sizing ratings like 'fits up to 65 inches' are a maximum, not a minimum. A smaller TV on a larger stand is fine visually and functionally, though for the best proportions, aim for a stand width around 2/3 to 3/4 of your TV's diagonal screen size." },
