      "This third-generation LISEN arm uses a steel body with shock-absorbing springs and a tension knob at each joint, addressing the sagging problem that plagues cheaper gooseneck arms once a phone's weight settles in. The one-touch spring clip has a built-in silicone pad and handles phones with most protective cases attached.\\n\\nThe bi-directional base clamps to desks, bed frames, or nightstands, and the whole arm folds flat for storage. It is the most structurally reinforced pick here, appropriate for buyers who plan to leave a phone mounted overhead for extended video sessions.\n\nIt leads this comparison mainly on build reinforcement and how well it holds a phone steady during touch interaction, worth weighing directly against the SAIJI Gooseneck Bed Phone Holder.\n\nCase-friendly spring clip.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check clamp weight capacity against a phone plus its protective case, not a bare phone",
    "explanation": "A phone arm's rated weight capacity is often demonstrated with a bare, caseless phone in marketing photos, which understates the real load once you factor in a protective case, especially a chunky battery case or an otter-style rugged case that can add meaningful extra weight.\n\nThis matters because a clamp rated just barely above a bare phone's weight can sag or slowly droop over hours of real use once a case is added, a common complaint on budget gooseneck arms.\n\nCheck the listing for the stated weight capacity, and add your phone's actual case weight to your phone's weight before comparing that total against the arm's rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm clamp desk-edge compatibility for your specific desk thickness",
    "explanation": "Every clamp-on phone arm has a maximum and minimum desk edge thickness it can grip securely, and this range varies meaningfully between products even at a similar price, some fit only a standard desktop edge while others accommodate a thicker standing-desk edge or a rounded lip.\n\nThis matters directly because a clamp too narrow for your desk simply won't close securely, and one that's mismatched for a thin edge won't grip firmly, risking the whole arm slipping under the phone's weight.\n\nMeasure your desk edge thickness in inches and compare it against the exact clamp range stated in the product specs before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh stability under touch interaction, not just static holding power",
    "explanation": "Tapping a mounted phone's screen creates real lateral force that a passively displayed device sitting still never experiences, and an arm that holds a phone steady when undisturbed can still wobble noticeably every time you tap to answer a call, scroll a recipe, or adjust a video during a call.\n\nThis matters more for any use case involving regular screen taps, like following a recipe or using the phone as a secondary touch display, less if the phone is purely for passive viewing like a video call where you rarely touch the screen.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of wobble during tapping or touch interaction, not just how stable the arm looks when the phone is simply mounted and untouched."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match arm reach and joint count to your actual desk layout and viewing angle needs",
    "explanation": "A simple gooseneck arm bends into one general position and stays there, while a fully articulating arm with multiple joints lets you reposition the phone to a wide range of angles and distances, useful if you need to switch between overhead recording, eye-level video calls, and side-mounted reference viewing throughout the day.\n\nThis matters more if your desk setup genuinely needs that flexibility, less if the phone will sit in roughly the same spot and angle every time you use it.\n\nCheck the listed reach and joint configuration against how many different positions you'll realistically need, since more joints and reach usually mean a bulkier, pricier arm."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider overhead versus side-mounted positioning for your specific use case",
    "explanation": "Overhead phone arms position the phone facing straight down, ideal for filming a desk workspace, following a recipe laid flat on the counter, or scanning documents, while side-mounted or eye-level arms position the phone facing forward or angled slightly down, better suited to video calls or watching content while working.\n\nThis distinction matters directly for matching the arm to your actual use case, an overhead arm mounted for filming is the wrong angle for a video call, and vice versa.\n\nCheck the listing's intended positioning and mounting angle range against your specific use case before assuming any \"phone arm\" covers every use equally well."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Will a desk phone arm damage my desk surface?", a: "All the picks in this guide use silicone or EVA padding at the clamp contact points to reduce marking risk, but very high clamp torque on soft wood finishes can still leave faint marks over time. Check felt pads for glass or lacquered desks specifically." },
  { q: "Can these arms hold a phone with a thick case?", a: "The LISEN and MAGIPEA picks have wider clip tolerances built for case-equipped phones. The SAIJI pick's clip is narrower (4.0-6.3in) so check your case-inclusive width before buying." },
  { q: "What's the difference between a gooseneck arm and a magic arm?", a: "A gooseneck bends via a flexible or stiff internal wire and holds shape through material rigidity. A magic arm uses discrete ball-joint segments locked by a friction knob, which holds position more reliably under repeated use." },
  { q: "Do I need a magic arm if I just want to watch videos in bed?", a: "No. A basic gooseneck like the SAIJI or MAGIPEA pick is sufficient for passive viewing. Magic arms are worth the extra cost mainly for content creators who need rock-solid positioning for filming or video calls." },
  { q: "Can I mount a webcam or ring light instead of a phone on these arms?", a: "The SMALLRIG and NEEWER magic arms both use standard 1/4-20 threads and can swap between a phone clip, webcam, or small light. The gooseneck picks are phone-clip only." },
