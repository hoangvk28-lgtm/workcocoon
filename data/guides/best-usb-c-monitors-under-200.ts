export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Delta E Figure Is a Real Verification, Not Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "Delta E measures how closely a display's color reproduction matches the intended reference color, with a value under 2 generally considered accurate enough that most people can't perceive the difference from the true color. When a listing states a specific Delta E number backed by an independent tool like Calman verification, that's a genuine, checkable claim, unlike a vaguer statement like \"vivid colors\" or a bare color gamut percentage with no calibration process described. If color accuracy matters for your work, look specifically for a stated Delta E figure and calibration method, not just a gamut percentage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match USB-C Power Delivery Wattage to Your Specific Laptop, Not Just a Bigger-Number Assumption",
    "explanation": "USB-C Power Delivery wattage determines how much charging power a monitor can send to your laptop through the same cable carrying video, and requirements vary widely: many ultrabooks charge fully at 45-65W, while larger or gaming laptops often need 90W or more to charge while in active use. Buying a monitor with power delivery below what your laptop needs means it will still charge, just more slowly, or not keep up if you're using the laptop heavily while connected, so check your laptop's own charger wattage before assuming any USB-C monitor will fully power it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Bigger Screen at the Same Resolution Means Larger, Softer-Looking Pixels",
    "explanation": "Moving from a 24 inch 1080P panel to a 32 inch panel at the same 1080P resolution, or even to 1440p, spreads the same or similar pixel count across more physical screen area, which can make text and fine details look slightly less sharp up close compared to a smaller, higher pixel-density panel. This is a real tradeoff worth considering specifically if you sit close to your monitor or do detail-oriented work, rather than assuming a bigger screen number is a straightforward upgrade in every dimension."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VA and IPS Panels Handle Viewing Angles and Contrast Differently",
    "explanation": "VA (Vertical Alignment) panels, like the Sceptre pick in this comparison, generally deliver higher contrast ratios and deeper blacks than IPS panels, but tend to show more color and brightness shift when viewed from an angle. IPS panels, like the ASUS and ViewSonic picks here, maintain more consistent color from wider viewing angles but typically have somewhat lower native contrast. If you often view your monitor from an angle, or share the screen with someone sitting beside you, IPS is generally the safer choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Speakers and Ethernet Are Genuine Convenience Features, Not Just Marketing Filler",
    "explanation": "A monitor with built-in speakers, like the Sceptre pick, or built-in Ethernet, like the ASUS BE249CGN, removes the need for separate desk accessories or a reliance on WiFi for a stable connection, both real quality-of-life improvements for a single-cable desk setup. These features are easy to overlook when comparing headline specs like resolution and refresh rate, but they can meaningfully reduce the number of extra cables and devices cluttering your desk."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is factory color calibration worth paying for if I'm not a professional photo or video editor?", "a": "If you don't do color-sensitive creative work, factory calibration matters less, and a monitor like the Sceptre 32-inch QHD, without formal calibration but with a larger screen and faster refresh rate, likely serves general use and gaming better for a similar price." },
  { "q": "Will a 96W USB-C monitor overcharge or damage a laptop that only needs 45W?", "a": "No, USB-C Power Delivery negotiates the appropriate wattage between the monitor and your laptop automatically, so a 96W-capable monitor will simply deliver only what your 45W laptop actually requests, not force excess power into it." },
  { "q": "What's the practical difference between 1080P and 1440p at these screen sizes?", "a": "1440p packs roughly 1.78 times more pixels into the same or similar screen area as 1080P, resulting in sharper text and more visible detail, particularly noticeable in photo editing, spreadsheets with dense data, or reading small text for extended periods." },
  { "q": "Can I daisy-chain monitors using USB-C instead of DisplayPort?", "a": "Daisy-chaining is generally a DisplayPort-specific feature, so the ASUS BE249CGN in this comparison supports it over its DisplayPort output specifically, not over USB-C. Check your source device's DisplayPort version compatibility before setting up a daisy-chained multi-monitor arrangement." },
  { "q": "Do VA panels like the Sceptre pick work well for photo editing despite lacking factory calibration?", "a": "VA panels can display rich, high-contrast images, but without factory calibration and a stated Delta E figure, color accuracy isn't guaranteed to match a reference standard, making them less reliable for color-critical editing work compared to a calibrated IPS panel like the ASUS ProArt." },
  { "q": "How long does a monitor's stated 5-year warranty actually cover, and does it require registration?", "a": "For the ASUS ProArt PA247CV in this comparison, the listing specifies 3 years of standard coverage plus an additional 2 years available through online registration, meaning you need to actively register the product to receive the full 5-year term rather than getting it automatically at purchase." }
