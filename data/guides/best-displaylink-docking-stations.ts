export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Why can't I calibrate color on my DisplayLink-connected monitor?",
    a: "DisplayLink's driver intercepts the GPU's output and compresses it into USB data before sending it to the display, which means Windows Display Color Calibration and ICC color profiles have no effect on that connection. This is a structural limitation of DisplayLink technology, not a bug, so color-critical work should stay off DisplayLink-connected displays entirely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a DisplayLink dock slow down my laptop?",
    a: "It adds a real but usually modest CPU tax, typically 3-15% additional load even at idle, since DisplayLink renders display output through CPU and GPU compression rather than passing it through natively. On fanless laptops like base MacBooks, this can show up as noticeably higher surface temperature during extended use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why did my external monitors stop working after a macOS update?",
    a: "DisplayLink driver updates typically lag macOS releases by days to weeks, so updating macOS right after a new release can leave DisplayLink-connected monitors dark until DisplayLink ships a compatible driver. Check DisplayLink's compatibility page before updating macOS if you rely on a DisplayLink dock daily.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use DisplayLink or a native Thunderbolt dock?",
    a: "Use DisplayLink when your laptop genuinely can't natively drive the number of displays you want, which covers base Apple Silicon Macs and many older Windows laptops. Use a native Thunderbolt dock like the Plugable TBT-UDM or Dell SD25TB4 when color accuracy or minimal latency matters more than adding extra screens.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is my DisplayLink 4K display running at 30Hz instead of 60Hz?",
    a: "4K at 60Hz over DisplayLink requires at least a USB 3.0 connection at 5Gbps. If your laptop's port is actually USB 2.0, or the dock's internal wiring bottlenecks the connection, output drops to 1080p or 4K at 30Hz. Check both your laptop's port spec and the dock's rated USB generation before expecting full 4K 60Hz.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick in this list is best for a MacBook Air that needs 3 monitors?",
    a: "The Plugable UD-ULTCDL is built specifically around Mac compatibility and explicitly documents its DisplayLink driver requirement for triple-display output, which is exactly what a base M-series MacBook Air needs since it only natively supports a single external display.",
