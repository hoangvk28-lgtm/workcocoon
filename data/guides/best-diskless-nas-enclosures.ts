  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "What's the difference between a diskless NAS enclosure and a complete NAS with drives included?",
    a: "A diskless enclosure ships empty, letting you choose your own drive brand, capacity, and recording type, which usually saves money over a bundled unit but requires you to research drive compatibility yourself. A complete NAS with drives included is simpler for first-time buyers who want to avoid that research, though it typically costs more for the same total capacity and locks you into the manufacturer's bundled drives.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need CMR drives or can I use SMR drives in a diskless NAS?",
    a: "Always use CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording) drives for any RAID array. SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) drives write new data by overlapping existing tracks, which slows dramatically during a RAID rebuild and can cause the rebuild to fail entirely. Some lower-capacity drives marketed toward NAS use still use SMR, so verify the recording type on the specific model, not just the marketing label, before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my Synology NAS show a warning for a third-party drive that should be compatible?",
    a: "2024+ Synology Plus-series models, including the DS925+ and DS725+ in this list, show compatibility warnings in DSM for drives that aren't Synology-branded, even when the drive is a suitable CMR NAS drive. Synology-branded drives avoid the warning but carry a 15-30% price premium over comparable third-party NAS drives. Older Value-series models like the DS223j and DS223 are less restrictive.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between the DAS enclosures and the NAS enclosures in this list?",
    a: "The QNAP TR-004 and TERRAMASTER D4-320 are direct-attached storage (DAS), they connect via USB to one computer and handle RAID onboard, but they have no network sharing, apps, or multi-user access. The Synology and UGREEN picks are true network-attached NAS units that multiple devices can access over the network and that support an app ecosystem like Plex or Surveillance Station.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a diskless NAS come with the operating system pre-installed?",
    a: "No. A diskless enclosure ships with no OS installed. During first setup, the NAS operating system downloads and installs automatically for most brands, which requires an internet connection and takes real time on first boot. This first-boot installation step surprises some new buyers who assume the OS ships pre-loaded.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many bays do I actually need for a home diskless NAS?",
    a: "2 bays are enough for simple backup with basic RAID 1 mirroring, covered by picks like the Synology DS223j and DS223 in this list. 4 bays, like the DS423 or DS925+, open up RAID 5 or SHR with a real spare-drive margin and more total capacity, worth the extra cost if you expect to grow past basic backup into Plex, surveillance, or business use.",
