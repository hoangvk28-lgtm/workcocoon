export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Formal Platform Certification Means Something Different Than General Compatibility Claims",
    "explanation": "A formal certification, like the Yealink SP92's Microsoft Teams certified status, means the manufacturer submitted the device for official testing and approval by that specific platform, while a general compatibility claim like 'works with most conferencing platforms' means the manufacturer simply expects it to function without formal verification. This matters directly in workplace settings where IT departments often maintain an approved hardware list requiring certified devices, since a non-certified unit might work fine technically but fail a procurement requirement. Check the listing specifically for the word 'certified' alongside a named platform, rather than assuming any speakerphone that mentions a platform's name has been formally approved by it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dedicated Bass-Radiator Speaker Hardware Is a Genuine Audio Upgrade Beyond Basic Mic-Focused Design",
    "explanation": "The Anker PowerConf S330's 1.75 inch driver paired with 2 passive bass-radiators is dedicated speaker hardware specifically designed to reproduce fuller sound, a meaningful step up from speakerphones that focus their engineering primarily on the microphone side and treat the speaker as a secondary feature. This matters if you also plan to use the device for playing music or listening to recorded meeting audio, not just live calls, where richer bass and clarity become noticeably more apparent. Check the listing for specific speaker driver measurements or bass-radiator mentions if audio playback quality matters to you beyond basic call clarity."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Triple Connectivity Options Provide Real Redundancy If One Connection Method Fails or Isn't Available",
    "explanation": "The Yealink SP92's three connection methods, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C cable, or an included BT51C dongle, mean you have a working fallback if your laptop lacks a spare USB port or if Bluetooth pairing runs into interference in a crowded office environment. A single-connection-method device, like the USB-C-only Anker pick, works fine under normal circumstances but leaves you without an alternative if that one method becomes unavailable or unreliable. Consider your actual device ecosystem, how many devices you'll connect to and how often, before assuming a single connection type covers all your scenarios."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Volume Level Indicators Provide Practical Feedback That Silent Volume Adjustment Doesn't",
    "explanation": "The EMEET M1A's 9 adjustable volume levels paired with a visible blue LED indicator let you confirm your current volume setting at a glance without needing to test it audibly first, which matters in a meeting setting where you can't casually make noise to check volume before an important call starts. This is a minor but genuinely practical detail that a device without visual feedback lacks, forcing you to either remember your last setting or make an audible test adjustment. Check product images and the listing description for mentions of LED indicators or on-device displays if this kind of quick visual confirmation matters to your workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pickup Radius Claims Assume Ideal Conditions and Should Be Verified Against Your Actual Room's Acoustics",
    "explanation": "The stated pickup radius figures in this tier, from 3 meters on the Anker and RayBit picks to 13 feet on the Yealink SP92, are generally measured under favorable acoustic conditions without significant background noise or hard, echo-prone surfaces. This matters because a room with hard flooring, bare walls, or significant ambient noise from HVAC systems can effectively reduce the practical pickup range below the stated figure. Test any speakerphone in your actual room with a real call before committing to it for a permanent meeting room setup, rather than assuming the stated radius translates directly to your specific space."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does Microsoft Teams certification mean a speakerphone won't work with Zoom or Google Meet?", "a": "No, the Yealink SP92 pick's Teams certification is an additional formal approval on top of its general compatibility, and it still works with Zoom, Google Meet, Cisco Webex, and other major platforms without issue." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between a Bluetooth-capable and USB-only speakerphone?", "a": "Assuming Bluetooth is always the better choice, when a stable wired USB connection like on the Anker or RayBit picks actually avoids potential Bluetooth interference and pairing hassles for a fixed desk setup that never needs to move." },
  { "q": "Is the Yealink SP92 worth it over the cheaper RayBit option?", "a": "If you specifically need formal Teams certification, the longest battery life, or multiple connectivity options, yes, but if you just need reliable wired call quality without certification requirements, the RayBit pick covers that for about $20 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the Anker PowerConf S330's bass-radiator speakers will improve my meeting audio noticeably?", "a": "The improvement is most noticeable when playing music or listening to richer audio content rather than during typical speech-focused conference calls, where the difference from a standard speaker is less pronounced but still present." },
  { "q": "Can the EMEET M1A be used without installing any special software?", "a": "Yes, it connects via USB-C to USB-A plug and play with no drivers required, and it works across major conferencing platforms without needing dedicated software installation." },
  { "q": "Do these speakerphones require a wall outlet to work, or can they run on battery alone?", "a": "The Yealink SP92 specifically includes a 20-hour rechargeable battery for cordless use, while the Anker, EMEET M1A, and RayBit picks in this tier don't specify standalone battery power, suggesting they primarily rely on USB connection for power." }
