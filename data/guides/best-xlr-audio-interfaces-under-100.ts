export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Bundled Software Value Should Be Weighed as Real Cost Savings, Not Just a Marketing Add-On",
    "explanation": "The PreSonus pick specifically states its included software bundle is worth over $1,000, and the Focusrite Scarlett Solo includes established titles like Pro Tools Intro+ and Ableton Live Lite, meaning the effective cost of these interfaces is meaningfully lower than the sticker price once you factor in software you would otherwise need to purchase separately to start recording professionally. This matters directly if you don't already own recording software, where the bundled value can represent genuine savings, and matters less if you're already committed to a specific DAW that isn't included in any bundle. Check whether you already own compatible recording software before assuming a bundled software value adds meaningful savings to your specific situation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Specifically Stated Dynamic Range Figure in Decibels Provides a Concrete, Comparable Audio Quality Metric",
    "explanation": "The BlueAVS pick specifically states a 103dB dynamic range with THD+N under 0.003%, concrete technical specifications that let you compare audio fidelity against other interfaces with similarly disclosed figures, unlike a listing that simply claims 'studio quality' or 'crystal clear' sound without supporting technical data. This matters if precise audio fidelity comparison is a priority for your recording work, particularly for music production where subtle audio quality differences matter more than for casual podcast recording. Look for specifically stated dynamic range and THD+N (total harmonic distortion plus noise) figures when comparing audio quality claims across similarly priced interfaces, rather than relying on generic marketing language."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual XLR Input Support Enables Genuinely Different Recording Scenarios Than a Single-Input Interface",
    "explanation": "The MAONO P2, PreSonus, and BlueAVS picks all support 2 simultaneous XLR microphone inputs, enabling recording formats like co-hosted podcasts or duo musical performances that a single-input interface like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo simply can't accommodate without needing to record each person separately or use a workaround. This matters directly based on your specific recording format, where solo content creators genuinely don't need the second input, while anyone regularly recording with another person needs it as a functional requirement, not just a nice-to-have feature. Confirm your typical recording format (solo versus multi-person) before assuming a single-input interface's other advantages, like superior bundled software, outweigh the practical need for a second XLR input."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Simultaneous Multi-Device Connectivity Solves a Genuine Workflow Problem for Content Creators Working Across Platforms",
    "explanation": "The MAONO P2's hybrid dual USB port design specifically lets you connect to both a computer and a mobile device simultaneously, enabling a workflow where you record in a desktop DAW while also streaming or uploading directly from your phone, a genuinely different capability from an interface that only connects to one device at a time. This matters if your specific content creation workflow spans both desktop recording software and mobile-based streaming or social platforms, less so if you exclusively work within one device ecosystem for your recording and publishing process. Consider whether your actual workflow genuinely spans multiple device types simultaneously before treating this specific feature as a meaningful differentiator over a single-connection interface."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length Differences at This Tier Reflect Real Manufacturer Confidence Variance Worth Checking",
    "explanation": "The Focusrite Scarlett Solo's stated 3-year worldwide warranty is meaningfully longer than the 1-year coverage typical of newer or budget-focused brands like BlueAVS, a difference that matters more the longer you plan to keep and rely on the interface for your recording work. This matters if you're investing in equipment you expect to use for years without replacement, where extended warranty coverage provides more assurance against manufacturing defects surfacing after the first year. Check the specific stated warranty length in a listing rather than assuming all interfaces at a similar price point carry equivalent coverage, since this detail varies meaningfully even among similarly priced options."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use the Focusrite Scarlett Solo's single input for recording a guitar and microphone at the same time?", "a": "No, the Scarlett Solo has one mic preamp and one instrument input, meaning you can connect either a microphone or an instrument to each respective input simultaneously, but it can't record two microphones or two instruments through the same single mic preamp channel." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing bundled software value across these interfaces?", "a": "Assuming all bundled software offers equivalent long-term value, when checking whether you already have compatible recording software, or whether a bundle includes industry-standard titles like Pro Tools versus newer proprietary software, meaningfully affects how much real value that bundle actually adds to your purchase." },
  { "q": "Is the Focusrite Scarlett Solo worth it over the cheaper PreSonus AudioBox 96 option?", "a": "If you specifically want the 3-year warranty and prefer the specific software titles included (Pro Tools Intro+, Ableton Live Lite, Cubase LE), yes, but if maximum stated bundled software dollar value at a lower price matters more, the PreSonus pick covers that for about $25 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the MAONO P2's dual USB connectivity will actually work with my specific phone model?", "a": "The listing specifically states MFi-certified connectivity, meaning it's certified for use with Apple devices specifically, so checking whether your phone is an MFi-certified iOS device or confirming Android compatibility through the listing's specific device compatibility details is worth doing before assuming universal phone support." },
  { "q": "Do these budget XLR interfaces require external power, or can they run off USB alone?", "a": "The PreSonus AudioBox 96 specifically confirms USB bus-power with no additional power supply needed, while the other three picks in this comparison are also designed for USB-powered operation, making all four genuinely portable without needing a separate power adapter." },
  { "q": "Can I upgrade from one of these budget interfaces to a more advanced one later without losing my bundled software?", "a": "Bundled software licenses are typically tied to the specific hardware purchase and registration, so if you upgrade to a different interface later, checking each software title's specific license terms for transferability is worth doing, though most bundled titles remain usable once registered to your account regardless of which interface you're currently using." }
