  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Does a 100W power delivery dock actually charge my laptop at 100W?",
    a: "No. The dock's own chipset, USB controllers, and display circuitry use 10-15W from that 100W budget just to run the dock itself, so the laptop typically receives roughly 82-90W in practice. This overhead applies to every dock in this list rated at 100W, so plan around the effective number rather than the advertised one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 100W enough to charge a MacBook Pro 16-inch?",
    a: "Not fully under sustained load. A MacBook Pro 16\" ships with a 140W stock adapter, and a 100W dock delivering roughly 82-90W effective will charge it more slowly than the original charger, potentially not keeping up during heavy CPU or GPU use. It's fine for light use or charging while idle, but demanding workloads may still slowly drain the battery even while docked.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a dock rated higher than 100W, like the 160W Anker Prime, charge my laptop faster than 100W?",
    a: "Not to a single device over standard USB Power Delivery, which caps at 100W per device regardless of the dock's total power budget. A higher total rating like the Anker Prime's 160W mainly means more power is available to share across multiple connected peripherals at once, not that one laptop can exceed the 100W PD ceiling without USB PD 3.1 Extended Power Range (EPR) support.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my dock charge my laptop slower when I have other devices plugged in?",
    a: "A dock's total power budget is shared between the laptop and any USB-A or USB-C peripherals charging through it, like a phone or tablet. Charging multiple devices at once through the dock reduces how much wattage is left for the laptop, which can measurably slow the laptop's own charging speed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use a smaller third-party charger with my docking station to save space?",
    a: "No. A dock's actual power delivery is limited by its included power brick's wattage. Swapping in a smaller third-party GaN charger reduces the real PD output the dock can supply, even if the dock itself is rated for 100W, so always use a power brick that matches or exceeds the dock's rated PD wattage.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between USB PD and USB PD 3.1 Extended Power Range (EPR)?",
    a: "Standard USB Power Delivery tops out at 100W to a single device, which is the ceiling every dock in this list operates under. USB PD 3.1 EPR extends that ceiling up to 240W, but only specialty docks support EPR; mainstream 100W-class docks, including every pick here, do not. Buyers with gaming laptops or mobile workstations needing more than 100W should look specifically for EPR-certified docks rather than a standard 100W-rated one.",
