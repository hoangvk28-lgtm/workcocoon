      "The BenQ ScreenBar Classic is a clip-on bar that mounts on the top edge of a flat or gently curved monitor and directs light downward onto the desk surface rather than toward the screen. Its auto-dimming sensor adjusts brightness based on ambient light, which means it compensates for room lighting changes without manual intervention. The touch control panel on the bar itself handles color temperature and brightness adjustments directly.\n\nThe bar is compatible with curved monitors down to 1500R radius, which covers most consumer ultrawide monitors. Buyers with monitors curved to 1000R or tighter should look at the purpose-built curved designs like the Quntis Curved variants in this roundup. CRI 95 color rendering means colors on the lit surface appear close to how they would under daylight, which matters for design work and color-accurate tasks.",

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What curvature radius do most monitor light bars support?",
    a: "Most standard clip-on light bars are designed for flat monitors and support gentle curves down to 1500R. Monitors with a 1000R to 1200R curve require either a purpose-built curved design like the Quntis Curved variants, or a premium model like the BenQ ScreenBar Pro or Halo 2 that explicitly lists 1000R compatibility. Always verify the curvature spec before purchasing a standard clip-on bar for a gaming-grade curved monitor.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do monitor light bars cause screen glare on curved monitors?",
    a: "Light bars are designed to direct light downward onto the desk surface rather than toward the screen, which minimizes glare regardless of monitor type. On curved monitors the slight inward angle of the top edge can cause a standard flat-bar clip to tilt the beam direction slightly. Purpose-built curved mounts like the Quntis Curved correct this by matching the mount angle to the monitor curvature.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a 1000R and 1800R monitor for light bar compatibility?",
    a: "The R number describes the radius of the curve in millimeters. A 1000R curve is tighter than 1800R. Most consumer curved monitors sold as general displays use 1800R or 1500R. Gaming monitors commonly use 1000R to 1200R for a more immersive curve. Tighter curves (lower R numbers) are harder for standard clip mounts to grip securely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is auto-dimming worth it on a monitor light bar?",
    a: "Auto-dimming adjusts brightness based on ambient room light using a built-in sensor. It is useful in rooms where lighting changes throughout the day, such as rooms with natural light from windows. For setups in controlled artificial-light environments, manual control is sufficient. The BenQ ScreenBar Classic and Quntis Monitor Lamp both include auto-dimming at their respective price points.",

  {
    q: "Which monitor light bar is best for a 1000R curved gaming monitor?",
    a: "The BenQ ScreenBar Pro at $139 and the BenQ ScreenBar Halo 2 at $199 both list 1000R-1800R compatibility with premium build quality. For a mid-range option, the Quntis Curved at $59.99 uses dual pivoting arms specifically designed for curved surfaces and reaches tight curves more securely than flat-clip designs.",
