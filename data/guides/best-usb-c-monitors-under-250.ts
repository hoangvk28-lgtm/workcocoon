export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "4K on a 32\" Screen Has Lower Pixel Density Than 4K on a Smaller Panel",
    "explanation": "Pixel density, measured in pixels per inch (PPI), describes how tightly packed the pixels are on a screen, and a 32 inch 4K panel like the CUNPU pick in this comparison has a lower PPI (138) than a smaller 27 inch 4K panel would at the same resolution. This still delivers noticeably sharper text and detail than a 1440p panel of the same size, but it's worth knowing that \"4K\" alone doesn't guarantee the same sharpness across every screen size, since the physical panel dimensions change how tightly those pixels are packed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Not Every Monitor's USB-C Port Provides the Same Charging Wattage, Even at This Price",
    "explanation": "In this comparison alone, USB-C power delivery ranges from 15W on the LG pick, enough only for a phone or tablet, up to 65W on three other picks, enough to fully charge most ultrabooks. Before assuming any USB-C monitor in this price range will charge your laptop, check the specific wattage stated in the listing, since a lower-wattage monitor with an otherwise larger, sharper screen might not actually replace your laptop's charger the way you expect."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Driving 4K Content Requires More From Your Laptop's Graphics Than 1440p",
    "explanation": "A 4K monitor connected over USB-C asks your laptop's graphics hardware and USB-C port bandwidth to handle roughly 1.8 times the pixel count of a 1440p display, which can mean a lower maximum refresh rate, more strain on integrated graphics, or occasional performance hiccups on older or lower-powered laptops. If your laptop is a few years old or uses basic integrated graphics, a 1440p panel like the ASUS ProArt or Dell picks in this comparison may deliver a smoother experience than pushing a 32 inch 4K panel to its full resolution."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Software Features Like Screen-Splitting Can Replace a Separate Window Manager App",
    "explanation": "Some monitors, like the LG pick in this comparison with its Switch app, include manufacturer software that splits the screen into multiple sections for multitasking, similar to third-party window management tools you might otherwise install separately on your computer. If you already rely on a window-snapping tool or built-in OS feature for this, a monitor's own software adds less value, but if you don't, it's a genuine built-in convenience worth factoring into the comparison."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Faster Refresh Rate Pairs Best With a Laptop That Can Actually Output at That Rate",
    "explanation": "The Dell pick's 144Hz refresh rate only delivers a smoother visual experience if your laptop's graphics output, and the connection method you're using, can actually push a signal at that refresh rate; some USB-C connections or lower-powered graphics chips may cap out lower than the monitor's maximum, especially at higher resolutions. Check your laptop's own display output specifications, not just the monitor's advertised maximum, before assuming you'll see the full refresh rate benefit in practice."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the CUNPU's 4K resolution actually noticeably sharper than the ASUS ProArt's 1440p at these screen sizes?", "a": "Yes, moving from 1440p to 4K roughly doubles the pixel count, and even on a larger 32 inch panel, text and fine detail appear noticeably crisper on the CUNPU pick, particularly for reading dense text or viewing high-resolution photos and video." },
  { "q": "Can the LG 32U631A-B charge my laptop through its USB-C port?", "a": "Not fully. Its USB-C port is rated for only 15W of power delivery, which is enough to charge a phone or tablet but not sufficient to power most laptops, which typically need 45W or more depending on the model." },
  { "q": "Do I need a specific graphics card to drive a 32 inch 4K monitor smoothly?", "a": "Most modern integrated graphics found in recent laptops can handle basic 4K desktop use, like browsing and document work, but demanding tasks like video editing or gaming at 4K benefit from a dedicated graphics card. Check your laptop's specific graphics capabilities if you plan to do intensive work on the 4K panel." },
  { "q": "Is factory color calibration necessary if I mostly do general office work rather than design?", "a": "No, factory calibration mainly benefits color-critical work like photo editing, video color grading, or print design. For general office tasks, browsing, and everyday productivity, an uncalibrated panel like the CUNPU or LG picks in this comparison performs perfectly well." },
  { "q": "How does LG's Switch app compare to built-in window snapping in Windows or macOS?", "a": "LG's Switch app offers more granular pre-set screen-splitting layouts (up to 6 sections) specifically designed around the monitor, while built-in OS window snapping is generally simpler and less customizable but works across any monitor without additional software installation." },
  { "q": "Will a 144Hz monitor like the Dell S2725DC actually run at 144Hz over a basic USB-C connection?", "a": "It depends on your laptop's USB-C port capabilities and cable bandwidth; a full-featured USB-C port with sufficient DisplayPort Alt Mode bandwidth can support 144Hz at QHD resolution, but a lower-bandwidth connection may cap the effective refresh rate lower. Check your laptop's specific USB-C video output specifications to confirm." }
