Every purchase includes real creative software and access to Wacom's online training, a genuine value-add most budget tablets skip entirely.\n\nAs a screenless pen tablet, it maps to your existing monitor rather than adding a second display, keeping the setup simple and the price low. Wacom backs it with over 40 years in the category, which shows up in driver maturity and long-term software compatibility.",

  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
