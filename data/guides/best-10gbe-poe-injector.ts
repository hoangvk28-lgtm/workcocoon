export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A '10GbE' Label Should Be Confirmed as True 10Gbps Speed, Not a Rebranded 2.5G or 5G Unit",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison explicitly state true 10Gbps speed capability, but the broader market includes units marketed loosely with '10G' language that actually cap at lower speeds internally, meaning the specific stated speed range in a listing's technical specifications matters more than the product title alone. This matters significantly if you're specifically buying to support a genuinely bandwidth-hungry application like aggregated 4K camera feeds or a high-density Wi-Fi 7 deployment, since a mislabeled unit would fail to deliver the throughput you're paying for. Check the listing's technical specification section for an explicit 10Gbps mention alongside the full speed range (10/100/1000M/2.5G/5G/10G), not just a product title using '10GbE' language."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Compatibility With Specific Access Point Brands Like eero, UniFi, or Cudy Removes Real Negotiation Uncertainty",
    "explanation": "A listing that specifically names compatible access point models, like eero PoE 7 or UniFi U6-Enterprise, suggests the manufacturer has validated real-world PoE negotiation with that specific hardware, which matters more at the 10GbE tier where the connected equipment tends to be expensive and mission-critical. This matters significantly if you're deploying a specific brand's high-end access point and want documented confidence rather than relying on generic 802.3bt compliance claims, and matters less if you're comfortable troubleshooting a generic compliant unit. Check for named brand compatibility specifically when the connected device represents a significant investment you don't want to risk on an unverified pairing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "60W and 90W Power Tiers at the 10Gbps Speed Level Match Genuinely Different Device Categories",
    "explanation": "Even among true 10Gbps injectors, the actual power delivery tier varies between 60W and 90W in this comparison, and a device with a heater element or the most demanding enterprise features can specifically require the higher 90W ceiling while most standard Wi-Fi 6E/7 access points and PTZ cameras operate comfortably within 60W. This matters for correctly matching power tier to your specific device without either underpowering it or overpaying for unused capacity. Check your specific device's documented power class rather than assuming the highest-priced, highest-wattage 10Gbps injector is automatically the correct choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual AC/DC Input With Redundant Power Support Matters Specifically for Mission-Critical Industrial Deployments",
    "explanation": "A standard indoor 10Gbps injector accepts only AC power from a single source, while an industrial DIN-rail unit with dual AC/DC input and redundant power capability can continue operating if one power source fails, a genuinely different reliability tier appropriate for infrastructure where downtime has a real cost. This matters significantly for a critical installation like a security operations center or industrial control system, and matters not at all for a standard office or home network where a brief power interruption isn't consequential. Consider redundant power input specifically for deployments where continuous uptime is a genuine operational requirement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UL Certification and Documented Surge Protection Ratings Matter More at the 10Gbps Tier Given the Cost of Connected Equipment",
    "explanation": "A 10Gbps-capable access point or camera system represents a significant equipment investment, making the electrical safety and protection quality of the injector powering it a more consequential decision than at a lower-cost PoE tier, and a listing with UL certification or specific stated surge protection numbers (like 4kV or 6kV) gives you concrete, checkable assurance rather than a vague safety claim. This matters more for a permanent installation protecting expensive connected equipment, and matters less for a short-term test setup. Compare specific certification marks and stated protection numbers between listings when the cost of your connected 10Gbps equipment justifies the extra scrutiny."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a true 10GbE PoE injector for a standard home network?", "a": "Most home networks don't need 10Gbps speed; this tier is specifically justified for high-density Wi-Fi 7 deployments, multi-camera 4K surveillance backbones, or other genuinely bandwidth-intensive applications." },
  { "q": "Can I use a 10GbE PoE injector on a Gigabit-only network?", "a": "Yes, these injectors are backward compatible with lower speeds, but you won't see any benefit from the 10Gbps capability unless both the connected device and your network switch also support the higher speed." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between the 60W and 90W tiers at the 10Gbps speed level?", "a": "60W suits most standard Wi-Fi 6E/7 access points and PTZ cameras, while 90W is necessary only for the highest-draw devices like a camera with a heater element or the most demanding enterprise access point models." },
  { "q": "Is a first-party or brand-named-compatible 10GbE injector necessary for eero or UniFi hardware?", "a": "It's not strictly necessary since any compliant 802.3bt injector should work, but a listing with named eero or UniFi compatibility, like the PROCET pick, offers more confidence for that specific expensive hardware pairing." },
  { "q": "Does a 10GbE PoE injector need dual AC/DC input for a home installation?", "a": "No, dual power input with redundancy is specifically valuable for mission-critical industrial or infrastructure deployments; a standard AC-only unit is sufficient for a home or typical office installation." },
  { "q": "What cabling do I need for a true 10Gbps PoE connection?", "a": "Cat.6A cabling is typically required to reliably support 10Gbps speeds at longer distances (up to 90-100 meters), while standard Cat5e or Cat6 may not reliably sustain the full 10Gbps speed over longer runs." }
