      "As the only true laser printer in this list, the DCP-L2640DW is the sharpest text output here, because toner fuses to the page with clean, crisp edges rather than absorbing into the paper fibers the way inkjet ink does. That mechanical difference is why a 600dpi laser regularly looks sharper for plain text than a higher-resolution inkjet, even though the spec sheet number is lower.\n\nToner is also more archivally stable than dye-based inkjet ink, holding up for decades without the fading that can affect inkjet documents stored for the long term. Duplex printing and a mobile-ready design round it out, making this the pick for anyone whose documents are mostly black-and-white text that needs to stay legible for years.\n\nLong archival stability for legal or important documents.

    q: "Which printer is best for archival or legal documents?",
    a: "The Brother DCP-L2640DW, a monochrome laser, is the best fit here for legal or archival documents, since laser toner remains stable for well over 100 years. Dye-based inkjet documents can start fading within 25-50 years, which matters for anything you need to keep legible long-term.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I print on letterhead or pre-printed colored forms with an inkjet?",
    a: "Yes, but inkjet ink can occasionally bleed slightly at the edges of existing print on the page. Laser printers, like the Brother DCP-L2640DW or Brother HL-L3220CDW, fuse toner cleanly on top of letterhead without that bleed risk, making them the safer choice for official stationery.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use matte or glossy paper for document printing?",
    a: "Matte paper is the better choice for document legibility, since it doesn't produce the glare that glossy finishes can create under overhead lighting. Save glossy paper for photos or marketing materials instead.",
