export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Distinguish a certified Intel chip from a third-party controller",
    explanation: "Most USB4 NVMe enclosures use a third-party bridge chip, commonly the ASM2464PD, to translate between the NVMe drive and the USB4 port, but a smaller number use an Intel-certified chip like the JHL7440 instead, which Intel licenses specifically to accessory makers that pass its own Thunderbolt certification testing. This isn't just a branding difference: a certified chip generally means the manufacturer has validated compatibility against Intel's own reference hardware and driver stack, which can matter for edge-case compatibility on certain Mac or PC configurations. Look for the word \"certified\" paired with a specific chip name in the listing, rather than a vague \"premium chip\" claim with no model number attached."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Compare stated warranty length, not just brand recognition",
    explanation: "At this higher $90-150 price point, the warranty term becomes a real factor in the value calculation, since a failure a year or two after purchase costs you the full price again if there's no coverage. Some manufacturers in this category explicitly state a 2-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship, while others don't mention a warranty term at all in the main listing, which typically defaults to Amazon's standard return window rather than an extended manufacturer warranty. Check the listing's \"What You Get\" or warranty section specifically, and don't assume a 2-year warranty just because the brand is well known, since even recognized brands vary their warranty terms by product line."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match the enclosure to your SSD's specific PCIe generation",
    explanation: "Not every USB4 enclosure is built the same way around every NVMe drive generation. Some are specifically tuned and tested against PCIe Gen4 drives, naming a reference drive directly in the listing, while others are more general-purpose and don't specify a PCIe generation at all. If you're using a newer, faster PCIe Gen4 SSD, an enclosure specifically validated against that generation is more likely to actually deliver the drive's rated speed than a generic enclosure that was primarily tested with an older or slower drive. Check the listing for the specific SSD model used in any stated speed test, and see if it matches your own drive's generation."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check whether the enclosure supports SATA M.2 drives or only PCIe NVMe",
    explanation: "M.2 is a physical connector shape, not a single drive standard, and it's used by both older, slower SATA-based SSDs and newer, much faster PCIe NVMe SSDs that look identical from the outside. A USB4 enclosure built for 40Gbps speeds is generally designed and tested only for PCIe NVMe drives, and at least one enclosure in this comparison states explicitly that it does not support SATA M.2 SSDs at all, meaning the drive simply won't work in it regardless of the physical fit. Before buying, confirm your specific SSD is a PCIe NVMe drive (check the product listing or the drive's own model number against the manufacturer's spec sheet) rather than assuming any M.2-shaped drive is interchangeable."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Look for a sustained-speed claim, not just a peak burst number",
    explanation: "A single peak transfer speed, often quoted from a short benchmark test, doesn't tell you how the enclosure performs during a long, continuous transfer where heat has time to build up and potentially throttle performance. A small number of listings in this category go further and state a specific sustained-use rating, such as a number of hours the enclosure can run at full speed before thermal effects become a concern. If your typical use case involves multi-hour backup jobs, large video exports, or extended file transfers rather than quick file drops, prioritize a listing that makes a sustained-speed claim specifically, not just a peak number from a brief test."

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Is it worth paying up to $150 instead of staying under $100 for a USB4 enclosure?",
    a: "Only if you specifically need one of the things the higher tier adds: a certified Intel Thunderbolt chip, a longer name-brand warranty, or drive capacity past 8TB. The raw 40Gbps speed rating doesn't meaningfully change between the two price tiers, since most picks in both use the same class of controller chip."
  },
  {
    q: "What's the real difference between a certified Intel chip and a third-party controller like the ASM2464PD?",
    a: "A certified Intel chip means the manufacturer passed Intel's own Thunderbolt certification testing for that specific product, which can mean more validated compatibility on certain hardware, particularly Macs. The more common third-party ASM2464PD controller generally delivers faster tested speeds in practice and is used in the large majority of enclosures in this category, including most of the picks in this comparison."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a SATA M.2 SSD in any of these enclosures?",
    a: "No. Every enclosure in this comparison is built specifically for PCIe NVMe drives, and at least one explicitly states it does not support SATA M.2 SSDs at all. If you're not sure which type your drive is, check its model number against the manufacturer's own spec sheet before buying an enclosure."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to buy a separate USB4 cable, or is one included?",
    a: "Most enclosures in this comparison include a USB4 or Thunderbolt-compatible cable in the box, though the included cable length is sometimes quite short (around 6 inches on some listings). If you need a longer cable for your desk setup, check the included cable's length in the listing and budget for a separate longer USB4 cable if needed."
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the Satechi Pro enclosure support 16TB when the others only go up to 8TB?",
    a: "This comes down to the enclosure's internal design and controller specification rather than the general USB4 standard, which doesn't impose an 8TB limit itself. Most manufacturers in this category simply design and test their enclosures around drives up to 8TB, since that covers the vast majority of consumer NVMe SSDs currently on the market, while Satechi specifically engineered and validated its Pro model for larger drives."
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 2-year warranty actually cover accidental damage to the enclosure?",
    a: "Typically not. A standard manufacturer's limited warranty, the kind mentioned across several picks in this comparison, covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, not accidental drops, liquid damage, or misuse. Check the specific warranty terms on the product listing or manufacturer's website for the exact coverage scope before assuming it covers any kind of damage."
