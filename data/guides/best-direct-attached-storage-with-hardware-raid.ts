    "note": "Look for a named RAID controller chip in the product documentation (like QNAP's dedicated controller or CENMATE's JMS567+JMB393) rather than a generic RAID claim. A product that requires installing a specific software utility to configure RAID modes may actually be host-managed rather than true hardware RAID."
  }
];

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "DAS means direct host attachment, not RAID",
    "explanation": "USB, Thunderbolt, and enterprise SAS storage can all be DAS. The term describes how the storage connects to a host, not whether it has RAID, what drive type it uses, or how many bays it has. Check those separately."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bay count is not usable capacity",
    "explanation": "An 8-bay enclosure with 8x20TB drives does not give you 160TB of usable space in RAID 5 or RAID 6, parity drives eat real capacity. Calculate usable capacity under your intended RAID mode, not raw bay count times drive size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hardware RAID and host software RAID are not interchangeable",
    "explanation": "Hardware/enclosure RAID keeps the array portable across hosts and survives an OS reinstall; host software RAID (or SoftRAID on Mac) ties the array to specific software but is often more flexible and doesn't depend on one controller chip surviving."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The interface link rate is not your real transfer speed",
    "explanation": "A 10Gbps USB-C enclosure with 5 mechanical HDDs running simultaneously will bottleneck well below 10Gbps once you account for real sustained HDD throughput, typically 150-250MB/s per drive. Multi-drive aggregate speed matters more than the port's rated maximum."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "RAID is not backup",
    "explanation": "RAID 1 or RAID 5 protects against a single drive failure, not against accidental deletion, ransomware, fire, or theft. Keep a genuine separate backup copy of anything irreplaceable, regardless of how much RAID redundancy your DAS provides."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Diskless enclosures need drives budgeted separately",
    "explanation": "Most multi-bay DAS enclosures ship completely empty. Factor in 2-8 hard drives or SSDs at your target capacity before comparing the enclosure's sticker price against a similarly-priced preconfigured external drive."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What happens if a hardware RAID controller fails?",
    "a": "This is hardware RAID's real recovery risk: if the specific controller chip fails, you generally need an identical or compatible replacement enclosure to read the array. Factor this into your backup strategy rather than treating RAID redundancy as a complete safety net."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does RAID replace the need for a separate backup?",
    "a": "No. RAID protects against a single drive's hardware failure, but it does not protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, fire, theft, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once. Keep a genuine separate backup copy of anything you can't afford to lose."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do DAS enclosures come with drives included?",
    "a": "Most multi-bay DAS enclosures in this category ship completely diskless, you supply your own 2.5in or 3.5in SATA HDDs/SSDs or M.2 NVMe SSDs depending on the model. Budget for drive cost separately when comparing total price against a preconfigured external drive."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will any USB-C or Thunderbolt cable give me full DAS speed?",
    "a": "No. Cable quality and rated bandwidth matter as much as the port. A basic charging-only USB-C cable can bottleneck a 10Gbps or faster enclosure well below its rated speed. Use the cable included with the enclosure, or one explicitly rated for the matching USB or Thunderbolt generation."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I add or remove drives from a DAS enclosure without powering it down?",
    "a": "Only if the specific enclosure documents hot-swap support, which most tool-free tray designs in this category do. Always check your specific product's hot-swap capability before removing a drive live, since not every budget enclosure supports it, especially some fixed-RAID-mode units."
