  "A pegboard's shelf attachment usually has its own, separate weight limit from the board's overall hook-load capacity, and it's worth verifying both independently rather than assuming the board's general rating covers whatever you put on the shelf. A shelf also projects forward from the board rather than hanging flat against it, which adds more tipping leverage than simple hooks do, worth thinking about loaded-shelf stability specifically rather than just the empty board's balance.",
  "Beyond weight, the shelf's attachment mechanism matters too, some use the same pegs or hooks as the rest of the board while others rely on a proprietary bracket that limits repositioning. A shelf with a raised edge lip also keeps small items from sliding off during normal desk use, worth checking for this detail since not every shelf includes it.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm genuine standard hole spacing before buying separate accessories",
    "explanation": "Real pegboard-style panels use standardized 1-inch hole spacing that any generic hook or accessory set is designed to fit, but not every product marketed as a \"pegboard\" actually uses this standard, some branded organizer systems use proprietary hole shapes or spacing that only accept that brand's own accessories.\n\nThis compatibility trap is rarely disclosed clearly on the listing page, and discovering it after buying a separate hook set that doesn't fit is a frustrating, avoidable mistake.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for confirmation of standard 1-inch hole spacing, or check reviews for mentions of using third-party hooks successfully, before assuming any board will accept accessories bought separately."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check material quality against real sag resistance over months of use",
    "explanation": "The board's material determines how much weight each hook can actually hold and whether the panel visibly sags after months of real use, genuine pegboard-grade hardboard, MDF, or metal holds up meaningfully better under sustained weight than thin decorative board that's simply printed or cut with a pegboard-style pattern for looks.\n\nThis matters directly if you plan to hang anything with real weight, monitor arms, tool organizers, or multiple loaded shelves, versus just a few lightweight decorative items.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific stated material and thickness, and check reviews for mentions of sagging or warping over time, not just the initial unboxing appearance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider loaded-condition tipping stability, not just the empty board's footprint",
    "explanation": "A pegboard mounted vertically at the back of a desk creates real tipping leverage once it's actually loaded with monitor arms, hooks, and shelves, a board that looks perfectly stable empty in a product photo can behave very differently once weighted, especially on a lighter desk without a wall anchor point.\n\nThis matters more the taller and heavier the loaded board becomes relative to the desk's own weight and base stability.\n\nCheck whether the product includes or supports a wall-anchor mounting option, and check reviews specifically for mentions of stability once the board is actually loaded with accessories, not just how it looks unmounted."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match desk depth loss to how much usable surface you can actually give up",
    "explanation": "A pegboard mounted at the back of a desk, especially a large panel, meaningfully reduces the usable flat desk surface in front of it, a tradeoff that's easy to underestimate from a product photo alone since the panel's actual footprint eats directly into working space you'd otherwise use for a keyboard, notebook, or additional monitor placement.\n\nThis matters more on a smaller or shallower desk where every inch of depth counts, less on a large desk with depth to spare.\n\nCheck the listed panel depth and desk clearance requirements against your actual desk's dimensions, not just the panel's height and width, before assuming it fits comfortably."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh mounting method against your desk type and whether you can drill into it",
    "explanation": "Pegboards mount to a desk in different ways, clamp-on brackets that grip the desk edge without drilling, freestanding designs that sit on the desk surface, or permanently screwed mounts, and which one applies to you depends heavily on your desk's construction and whether you're allowed or willing to drill into it.\n\nThis matters directly for a rented space, shared office furniture, or a desk you don't want to permanently modify, where a clamp-on or freestanding design is the safer choice even if it offers somewhat less rigid stability than a screwed mount.\n\nCheck the specific mounting method and confirm it's compatible with your desk's edge thickness and material before ordering."
