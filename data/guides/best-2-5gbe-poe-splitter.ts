export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The Correct Connector Type and Voltage Must Match Your Specific Non-PoE Device, Not Just Any 2.5GbE Splitter",
    "explanation": "The four picks in this comparison cover four genuinely different connector and voltage combinations (12V DC, 24V DC, USB-C 5V, and USB-A 5V), each matching a different category of non-PoE device, meaning buying based on speed rating alone without checking connector compatibility could result in a splitter that physically doesn't fit your device. This matters significantly since a 2.5Gbps speed rating is identical across all four picks, making connector type and voltage the actual differentiating factor for your specific purchase decision. Identify your exact device's connector type and voltage requirement first, then select the matching splitter, rather than choosing based on speed rating alone since all four options share the same 2.5Gbps performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Splitter's Maximum Output May Scale Up or Down Depending on Which Specific PoE Standard Powers It",
    "explanation": "The DSLRKIT pick specifically discloses a tiered output structure, 12W on standard 802.3af but up to 20W on 802.3at or a specific non-standard 48-52V passive source, meaning the same physical splitter delivers meaningfully different power depending on your exact upstream PoE equipment. This matters significantly if you're specifically trying to reach a splitter's higher advertised wattage tier but plan to use lower-tier existing infrastructure, since you won't receive the full rating without the appropriate PoE source. Check whether a splitter's maximum output requires a specific PoE standard, and verify your actual PoE switch or injector's standard, before assuming you'll receive the splitter's highest advertised wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB Connectors on PoE Splitters Typically Provide Power Only, Not Full USB Data Functionality",
    "explanation": "Both the REVODATA Type-C and DSLRKIT USB-A picks specifically note their USB connectors are for power/charging only, not general USB data transfer, meaning you can't use these splitters to also relay USB data signals to a peripheral device through that same port. This matters if you were considering using a splitter's USB output for both power and data to a device, which won't work as expected, and matters less if you only need power delivery while your device handles its own network connection separately (typically via its own Ethernet port). Confirm your specific device only requires power through the USB connection, not data transfer, before relying on these splitters for a combined power-and-data USB connection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual DC Plug Compatibility Can Remove Guesswork When You're Uncertain of Your Exact Camera's Barrel Connector Size",
    "explanation": "The REVODATA 12V/2A pick specifically states compatibility with both 5.5x2.5mm and 5.5x2.1mm DC connector sizes, a genuinely practical hedge against connector size uncertainty compared to a splitter that only fits one specific size. This matters if you haven't physically measured your exact camera's connector or are buying before the camera arrives, and matters less if you've already confirmed the precise connector size needed. Consider a dual-compatible splitter specifically if you're uncertain of your exact device's connector size, rather than risking a mismatched purchase."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "2.5Gbps Speed Provides Real Benefit Specifically for Devices That Can Actually Exceed Standard Gigabit Throughput",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically support 2.5Gbps speed, genuinely useful for a multi-gig-capable device like a WiFi 6E access point or a high-resolution 4K camera that can exceed the 1Gbps ceiling of standard Gigabit splitters, but providing no practical benefit for a basic device that tops out well under 1Gbps anyway. This matters if your specific connected device and network can actually utilize bandwidth beyond standard Gigabit, and matters much less for a standard IP camera or basic access point that doesn't approach even Gigabit bandwidth limits. Verify your specific device's actual maximum throughput capability and your network's multi-gig readiness before paying for 2.5GbE support it may never fully utilize."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a 2.5GbE splitter for a standard IP camera, or is Gigabit enough?", "a": "Standard 1080p or basic 4K cameras work fine with a Gigabit splitter, so a 2.5GbE splitter is specifically worth the investment only if your camera or network infrastructure can actually utilize bandwidth beyond standard Gigabit speeds." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 2.5GbE PoE splitter?", "a": "Choosing based on speed rating alone without checking connector type and voltage compatibility, when all four picks in this comparison share the identical 2.5Gbps speed and differ only in their actual DC or USB connector and voltage output." },
  { "q": "Can I use the USB-C splitter's port to also transfer data to my Raspberry Pi?", "a": "No, the REVODATA Type-C pick specifically states its USB-C port is for power/charging only, not data transfer, so your Raspberry Pi still needs its own Ethernet connection or the splitter's own RJ45 pass-through for network data." },
  { "q": "Will I get the full 20W from the DSLRKIT USB-A splitter on any PoE switch?", "a": "No, the DSLRKIT pick specifically states only 12W on a standard 802.3af source, with the full 20W requiring either an 802.3at switch or the manufacturer's specific non-standard 48-52V passive PoE source, so checking your exact PoE infrastructure is important." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my device needs 12V or 24V output from a 2.5GbE splitter?", "a": "Checking your specific device's power specification label or documentation for its exact voltage requirement is the reliable way to confirm which output you need before choosing between the 12V and 24V REVODATA picks." },
  { "q": "Is the REVODATA Type-C splitter compatible with a Raspberry Pi 3 or only the Pi 4?", "a": "The listing specifically names Raspberry Pi 4B/4B+ compatibility since those models use USB-C for power, while earlier Pi models like the Pi 3 use Micro USB instead and would need a Micro USB splitter rather than this USB-C model." }
