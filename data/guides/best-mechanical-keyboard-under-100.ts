An 8000mAh battery is roughly double the capacity of the RK84's 4000mAh cell, and the built-in screen displays battery level, connection mode, and basic customization feedback without needing companion software running in the background. Hot-swappable sockets and a knob for quick volume or media control round out the feature set at just under $90.\n\nTriple connectivity (Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, and wired) covers most desk setups, and the RGB backlighting is fully programmable through the board's own controls.
