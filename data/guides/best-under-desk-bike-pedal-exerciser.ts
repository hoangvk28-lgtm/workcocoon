  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",

    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this under desk bike pedal exerciser over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any under desk bike pedal exerciser you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    q: "How much desk clearance do I need for an under desk bike pedal exerciser?",
    a: "Most under-desk pedal exercisers need about 9-12 inches of vertical clearance between the floor and the underside of the desk, and standard desks run 28-30 inches tall. Desk crossbars or drawers can reduce usable clearance even on a taller desk, so measure your actual space rather than relying on the desk's listed height. The DeskCycle V2 is rated to fit under desks as low as 27 inches thanks to its adjustable height.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which under desk bike pedal exerciser is the quietest?",
    a: "The YOSUDA Under Desk Bike Pro is rated under 10dB, the quietest pick in this guide. A unit under 15dB feels nearly silent during a call, while up to 30dB is still tolerable but noticeable, and friction-resistance picks like the Vaunn or Wakeman tend to run louder than magnetic designs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between friction and magnetic resistance?",
    a: "Friction resistance, used in the Vaunn and Wakeman, is simpler and cheaper but tends to be louder and less smooth at higher settings. Magnetic resistance, used in the himaly Mini, DeskCycle V2, and YOSUDA Pro, runs quieter and generally feels smoother across resistance levels, but costs more.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick has the strongest resistance for a serious workout?",
    a: "The DeskCycle V2 offers up to 39 lbs of resistance across 8 magnetic levels, the strongest in this guide, driven by a high-inertia flywheel for a smoother pedal feel at higher settings.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does pedal size matter if I have larger feet?",
    a: "Yes. A short stride or small pedal can feel cramped for larger shoe sizes regardless of resistance range. Check the pedal dimensions in the listing against your foot size and desired range of motion before buying, rather than assuming any pedal exerciser will fit comfortably.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a motorized option that doesn't require active pedaling?",
    a: "Yes, the Exerpeutic 2000M is the only motorized pick in this guide, using an electric motor to move the pedals for you. It's a good fit for anyone recovering from an injury or who wants passive movement rather than an active pedaling workout.",
