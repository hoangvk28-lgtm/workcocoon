export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Decide if you need 4 bays or if 2 bays covers your actual use case",
    explanation: "A 2-bay NAS at this budget generally dedicates both drives to a single RAID 1 mirror for Time Machine redundancy, meaning all your storage capacity serves one purpose. A 4-bay NAS lets you split storage into two separate pools, for example, two drives mirrored specifically for Time Machine and two more drives configured differently for general file storage or media serving, keeping backup storage logically and physically separate from everything else. If Time Machine backup is genuinely your only use case for this device, a 2-bay unit is sufficient and cheaper; if you also want to use the same NAS for other storage needs, the extra bays on a 4-bay unit are worth the higher price."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check for dedicated M.2 NVMe cache slots if performance matters beyond backup",
    explanation: "Some NAS units at this price include separate M.2 NVMe slots specifically for SSD caching, distinct from the main hard drive bays, which can dramatically speed up random read/write operations like Time Machine's frequent small incremental backups or general file browsing performance. This caching only helps if you actually install compatible NVMe drives in those slots, an additional purchase beyond the NAS unit itself, and it isn't necessary if you're only doing occasional Time Machine backups with no other demanding NAS workload. Check whether a listing states dedicated NVMe cache slots as a spec, and factor in the cost of actual NVMe drives if you want to use that feature."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Compare named CPU models directly rather than assuming price reflects performance",
    explanation: "At this higher price tier, most listings do name a specific CPU model, giving you a real, comparable spec rather than a vague performance claim, and CPU strength genuinely matters more here than at the entry-level tier since buyers at this budget are more likely to run multiple simultaneous tasks: Time Machine backup, media transcoding, and general file access all at once. A stronger named CPU (more cores, higher clock speed) handles that kind of concurrent load more smoothly than a weaker one, even if both units cost a similar amount. Look up the specific CPU model named in the listing if you want to compare real-world benchmark performance rather than assuming a higher price automatically means a stronger processor."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weigh network port speed against your actual backup and restore frequency",
    explanation: "A NAS with dual 2.5GbE ports, found on some picks in this comparison, can theoretically deliver combined throughput well beyond a single standard Gigabit Ethernet port, particularly useful for the initial full Time Machine backup or a full restore after a Mac replacement, both of which move large amounts of data at once. Day-to-day incremental Time Machine backups after that first full backup are typically much smaller and less network-intensive, meaning the network speed advantage matters most during those two specific, less frequent events rather than daily use. If you rarely do full restores and your daily incremental backups are small, standard Gigabit Ethernet is likely sufficient; if you handle large restores or migrations more often, faster networking pays off more."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weigh an established software ecosystem against a newer platform's stronger named hardware",
    explanation: "Synology's DSM remains the most refined and extensively documented NAS operating system among the picks in this comparison, with a Time Machine setup flow and broader app ecosystem built up over many years, while newer platforms like UGREEN's own OS sometimes pack stronger named CPU specs into a similarly priced unit but with a shorter software track record. This is a genuine tradeoff rather than one platform being objectively better: DSM's maturity reduces the chance of hitting an undocumented setup issue, while a newer platform's stronger hardware can better handle demanding simultaneous workloads. Decide based on whether you value setup simplicity and documentation more, or raw processing power for concurrent tasks more, since both are legitimate priorities at this budget."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Is a 4-bay NAS worth the extra cost over a 2-bay unit just for Time Machine backup?",
    a: "Only if you want to use the same NAS for storage needs beyond Time Machine. A 2-bay unit configured as a RAID 1 mirror handles Time Machine backup redundancy fine on its own. A 4-bay unit lets you dedicate separate drives to backup versus other storage, which matters if you plan to use the NAS for more than just backup duty."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to buy NVMe cache drives separately if a NAS has NVMe slots?",
    a: "Yes. The NVMe slots themselves are a hardware feature built into the NAS, but compatible NVMe SSDs to actually populate those slots are sold separately in almost every case. Factor that additional cost into your budget if you specifically want to use a NAS's caching feature."
  },
  {
    q: "Will a stronger CPU actually make my Time Machine backups faster?",
    a: "It can help, particularly with the very first full backup or if you're running other tasks (like media transcoding) on the NAS simultaneously. For routine small incremental backups after that first one, network speed and drive speed generally matter more than raw CPU power."
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose a NAS with dual 2.5GbE ports over one with a single port?",
    a: "Dual ports can provide combined throughput beyond a single 2.5GbE connection if your network setup and switch support it, most beneficial during large full backups or restores. For routine daily incremental Time Machine backups, a single 2.5GbE or even standard Gigabit port is usually sufficient."
  },
  {
    q: "Is UGREEN's NAS software as reliable as Synology's DSM for Time Machine backup?",
    a: "UGREEN's own NAS OS is newer to market than Synology's long-established DSM, so it has a shorter track record and less accumulated community documentation, though the core Time Machine SMB functionality works the same way across both platforms. If setup simplicity and extensive documentation matter most to you, DSM's maturity is a real advantage."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I upgrade from a 2-bay NAS to a 4-bay one later and keep my Time Machine backup history?",
    a: "Not directly by simply moving drives, since migrating between different NAS models generally requires either a supported migration process (check the specific manufacturer's documentation) or starting a fresh Time Machine backup on the new unit. If you're unsure whether you'll want to expand later, it's often simpler to choose the bay count you expect to need from the start."
