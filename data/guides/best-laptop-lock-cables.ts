export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your exact laptop's security slot type, since it varies by model and generation, not just brand",
    "explanation": "Laptop security slots come in a handful of genuinely different physical standards, most commonly the Kensington Standard T-Bar slot (the original, widest design), the smaller Kensington Nano slot found on select thin and light models, and the Noble Wedge slot used by some other manufacturers, and these are not interchangeable, a lock built for one slot type simply will not physically engage a different slot shape.\n\nThis is not a brand-wide constant either: a manufacturer's lineup commonly mixes slot types across different model lines and even across generations of the same model line as laptops get thinner over time, so a lock confirmed compatible with one specific model doesn't guarantee compatibility with a different model from the same brand.\n\nCheck your exact laptop's model number and generation against the lock manufacturer's own documented compatibility list, rather than trusting a generic \"fits all laptops\" or brand-name-only claim from a retailer listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Choose between combination, keyed, and keypad locking mechanisms based on your actual daily habits",
    "explanation": "A combination lock uses a resettable numeric dial, avoiding the risk of losing a physical key but requiring you to remember (or securely record) the code, a keyed lock uses a physical key that's simple and fast to use but can be lost or need duplicating for multiple users, and a keypad lock uses an electronic push-button code entry, often with additional features like code memory or tamper alerts, at a typically higher price than the other two mechanisms.\n\nNone of these is universally superior, the right choice depends on whether you're more likely to lose a small physical key or forget a numeric code, and whether multiple people need independent access (easier to manage with individually cut keys than a single shared combination).\n\nMatch the mechanism to your own habits and whether you've historically been better at keeping track of small keys or remembering codes, rather than defaulting to whichever type looks most secure in marketing photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that a laptop lock is a deterrent, not a guarantee against a determined thief",
    "explanation": "Every cable-based laptop lock, regardless of price or brand reputation, can theoretically be defeated by a determined attacker with the right cutting tools and enough uninterrupted time, since the lock's actual security model relies on making theft slow, visible, and effortful enough to discourage casual or opportunistic theft rather than physically preventing a prepared attacker.\n\nThis matters because marketing language around \"military-grade\" or \"unbreakable\" cable locks can create a false sense of absolute security that leads to complacency, such as leaving an expensive laptop locked but unattended in a genuinely high-risk environment for extended periods.\n\nTreat any laptop lock as one layer of a broader security approach (also including where and how long you leave a device unattended), not a standalone guarantee, and set expectations accordingly regardless of how confidently a specific product is marketed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check cable length and material against your actual anchor point and desk setup",
    "explanation": "A laptop lock's cable needs to physically reach from your laptop's security slot to a suitably solid anchor point, such as a desk leg or a permanently fixed structure, and cable length varies meaningfully between products, from roughly 4 feet up to 6 feet or more, a real practical constraint if your nearest solid anchor point is further from your typical laptop position than a shorter cable can reach.\n\nCable material and construction (braided steel versus a simpler coated cable) also affects cut resistance, a genuinely relevant factor if the lock will sit in a semi-public space like a shared office or a coffee shop rather than a private, supervised room.\n\nMeasure the actual distance from where your laptop typically sits to your nearest solid anchor point before ordering, and favor a reinforced or braided steel cable construction specifically for any semi-public use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, especially for lesser-known brands versus established names like Kensington",
    "explanation": "Kensington effectively created and still dominates the laptop lock category, and its established products carry review counts in the hundreds or thousands built up over years, giving genuine statistical confidence, while newer or lesser-known brands selling similarly-specified locks at a lower price sometimes carry only a handful of reviews, a meaningfully thinner sample for judging real-world reliability of the locking mechanism itself over time.\n\nThis doesn't mean a lesser-known brand is automatically worse, security hardware doesn't require brand-name recognition to function correctly, but it does mean the claims on a thin-review listing carry less independently verified weight, particularly for a security product where mechanism failure has real consequences.\n\nWhen comparing an established brand against a newer, less-reviewed alternative at a similar price, factor the review depth into your confidence level, not just the star rating or the price alone."
