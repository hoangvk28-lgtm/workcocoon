    "explanation": "Two enclosures with the same 40Gbps label can behave differently depending on the bridge chip (ASM2464PD, JHL7440, RTL9210, and others each have different real-world characteristics). Where a listing names its controller, treat that as a real signal of build quality."

  {
    "criterion": "Separate peak benchmark speed from sustained performance",

    "explanation": "2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280 SSDs are not interchangeable in every enclosure, and M-Key versus B+M Key compatibility varies by product. Check your SSD's exact length and key type against the listing's stated support, not just \"M.2 compatible\"."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable and host requirements can silently cap speed",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a faster enclosure automatically mean faster real-world transfers?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. Real throughput depends on the SSD's own generation and speed, the bridge controller inside the enclosure, cable quality, and whether the host port actually supports the claimed protocol. A 40Gbps enclosure with a slow SSD won't outperform a 10Gbps enclosure with a fast one by much."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use any M.2 NVMe SSD in any enclosure in this list?",
    "a": "No. Check the exact M.2 length (2230/2242/2260/2280) and keying (M-Key vs B+M Key) the enclosure supports against your specific SSD before buying, and confirm whether the enclosure supports NVMe only or also SATA M.2 drives."
