    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "How many bays do I actually need?",
    a: "For basic single-user backup, 2 bays with simple mirroring (RAID 1) is enough, the Synology DS223 or DS225+ cover that well. A small household or home office generally benefits from 4 bays for a better balance of capacity and redundancy, and a large media library or multi-user small office is where 6 bays, like the UGREEN NAS DXP6800 Plus, actually pays off.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a higher bay count mean better performance?",
    a: "Not by itself. Bay count controls capacity and RAID flexibility, but CPU tier controls things like 4K transcoding and multi-app performance. A 2-bay unit with an Intel CPU, like the Synology DS225+, can outperform a weaker-CPU unit with more bays for tasks like media streaming.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the real cost difference between 2-bay and 6-bay NAS units once drives are included?",
    a: "Since NAS-rated drives run roughly $80-200 per bay, a 2-bay setup typically lands around $450-750 total, a 4-bay setup around $920-1,500, and a 6-bay setup around $1,400-2,100. Always compare total cost including drives, not just the enclosure price, across bay tiers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is RAID enough to protect my data on a larger NAS?",
    a: "No. RAID, at any bay count, only protects against a single drive failing, not against accidental deletion, ransomware, or the NAS itself being lost or damaged. The 3-2-1 backup rule, 3 copies of your data on 2 different media types with 1 copy offsite, is the real safety net regardless of how many bays your NAS has.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick in this guide has the most RAM?",
    a: "The UGREEN NAS DXP4800 GT has 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the highest among the 4-bay picks in this guide, thanks to its AMD R2514 CPU platform. More RAM matters if you plan to run multiple apps simultaneously, like file sync, a media server, and backup all at once.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I skip a NAS entirely and use cloud storage instead?",
    a: "If you only need backup for under 2TB of data and are a single user, a cheap monthly cloud storage subscription is usually more cost-effective than any NAS in this guide, even the cheapest 2-bay picks. A NAS starts making more sense once you have multiple users, more than about 5TB of data, or want local-network speed and privacy.",
