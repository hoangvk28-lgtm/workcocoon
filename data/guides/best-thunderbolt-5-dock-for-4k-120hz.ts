export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Refresh Rate Ceiling Almost Always Depends on How Many Displays Are Active Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo pick specifically documents four different display configurations with different refresh rates depending on how many monitors are connected at once, from three 8K@60Hz down to a four-monitor mix including 4K@240Hz and 4K@120Hz, illustrating that a dock's single headline refresh rate figure is rarely the number you'll get once you add a second or third display. This matters significantly if you're planning a multi-monitor setup where every display needs to hit a specific refresh rate, and matters less if you only run one external display. Look for a listing that specifically breaks down refresh rate by exact display count, rather than quoting only its best-case single-display number, before assuming a dock will support your full multi-monitor setup at your target refresh rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Windows and macOS Frequently Get Genuinely Different Display Capabilities From the Identical Dock Hardware",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit E5 pick specifically states Windows hosts can drive three 4K@144Hz displays while Mac hosts are capped at two 6K or 8K displays, or dual 4K@240Hz on supporting Macs, a real platform-level difference baked into the same physical dock rather than a minor footnote. This matters if you're choosing a dock for a specific operating system, since assuming Windows-quoted specs apply equally to macOS (or vice versa) can lead to a real letdown after purchase. Check whether a listing states its display specs separately for Windows and macOS, and read the platform-specific numbers that match your actual computer, not just the dock's single best-case headline claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sustained Power Delivery Under Full Multi-Display Load Is a Different Spec Than a Dock's Peak Charging Wattage",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit E5 pick specifically states its 90W power delivery is sustained across all 9 connected devices simultaneously, backed by a 180W power supply, distinguishing genuine sustained delivery from a peak wattage figure that might only apply with fewer devices connected. This matters if you're running a laptop plus several other powered peripherals off the same dock and need reliable charging throughout, and matters less if you only connect a laptop and one or two low-power accessories. Look for language specifically confirming sustained power delivery across the dock's full rated device count, not just a single peak wattage number that may not hold under real multi-device load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Modular or Upgradeable Dock Design Can Extend a Dock's Useful Life as Display Standards Change",
    "explanation": "The Dell SD25TB5 Pro pick specifically advertises a modular dock design with swappable module capability, letting a buyer upgrade specific components of the dock over time rather than replacing the entire unit when a new display standard or port type emerges. This matters if you expect to keep a dock for many years through multiple monitor upgrades, and matters less if you plan to replace the whole setup within a couple of years anyway. Check whether a dock's listing specifically names swappable or upgradeable components, since this is a genuinely differentiating feature most competing docks in this price range don't offer at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Purpose-Built Laptop-Specific Dock Trades General-Purpose Flexibility for a More Complete Out-of-Box Package",
    "explanation": "The Brydge ProDock Trio pick is specifically built only for MacBook Pro 16-inch models, shipping with a precision-fit sleeve, a vertical stand, and a Thunderbolt 5 cable included in the box, a more complete package than a standalone universal dock that ships with just the dock itself. This matters if you own the exact laptop model a dock is purpose-built for and want the extras included, and matters less if you might switch laptop brands or models in the future and need a dock that works across different devices. Weigh a purpose-built dock's included accessories and tailored fit against a universal dock's broader future compatibility before deciding which tradeoff fits your situation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will any Thunderbolt 5 dock give me 4K@120Hz on three monitors at once?", "a": "It depends on your operating system and host chip: the Lenovo and CalDigit picks in this comparison both document Windows-specific high-refresh triple-display support, while Mac display counts and refresh rates are generally more limited on the same hardware." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when shopping for a high-refresh Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming a dock's single headline refresh rate figure applies no matter how many displays you connect, when most docks specifically document a lower refresh rate ceiling once a second or third display is added." },
  { "q": "Is the Dell SD25TB5 Pro worth the higher price over the CalDigit E5?", "a": "If you specifically want a modular, upgradeable dock design and the broadest listed OS compatibility including Ubuntu, the Dell's higher price is justified, but if you mainly need strong Windows or Mac high-refresh display support at a lower cost, the CalDigit E5 is the better value." },
  { "q": "Do I need a genuine Thunderbolt 5 laptop to get the high refresh rates advertised on these docks?", "a": "Yes, full 80Gb/s bandwidth and the highest advertised refresh rate and display count combinations specifically require a genuine Thunderbolt 5 host, with reduced bandwidth and display support on Thunderbolt 4 or earlier hosts." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my exact MacBook Pro chip supports triple 4K@144Hz on the Brydge dock?", "a": "The Brydge listing specifically states full bandwidth and triple-display output require a Thunderbolt 5 MacBook with an M4 Pro, M4 Max, M5 Pro, or M5 Max chip or newer, so checking your exact chip generation against that list before buying is the reliable way to confirm support." },
  { "q": "Can I use these docks for both a home office and IT-managed corporate deployment?", "a": "Any of these docks work fine in a home office, but if you specifically need remote fleet configuration and diagnostics across many desks, the Lenovo ThinkPad Smart Dock 7500's cloud-based fleet management feature is built specifically for that corporate IT use case." }
