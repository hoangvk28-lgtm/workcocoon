export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Theoretical Bandwidth Rating Requires Both the Right Cable and the Right SSD to Actually Achieve",
    "explanation": "The Wokyis pick specifically discloses that its 80Gbps Thunderbolt 5 rating only translates to speeds above 3000MB/s when paired with a PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe 1.4 or higher SSD and the included Thunderbolt 5 certified cable, meaning a slower SSD or a non-certified cable will bottleneck performance well below the dock's headline rating. This matters significantly if you're pairing the dock with an older or budget SSD, where you won't see anywhere near the advertised maximum speed, and matters less if you're specifically purchasing a compatible high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD alongside the dock. Check both your SSD's actual PCIe generation and NVMe version, and confirm you're using the manufacturer's specified cable, before expecting a dock's theoretical maximum bandwidth rating to materialize in real-world use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "RAID 0 Configuration Doubles Capacity and Speed but Eliminates Data Redundancy Entirely",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS pick's dual-bay design specifically supports RAID 0 mode for up to 16TB at 917MB/s, striping data across both drives for combined capacity and speed, but this configuration means a single drive failure results in complete data loss across both drives since there's no redundant copy stored anywhere. This matters significantly if you're storing critical, irreplaceable data, where RAID 0's lack of redundancy is a real risk worth understanding before committing important files, and matters less if you're using the storage for easily replaceable or already-backed-up data where maximum capacity and speed are the priority. Understand that RAID 0 trades data safety for capacity and speed, and maintain separate backups of anything critical rather than relying on a RAID 0 array as your only copy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Explicitly Incompatible SSD Types Can Derail a Storage Purchase If Not Checked in Advance",
    "explanation": "The Satechi pick specifically states that SSDs with heatsinks or double-sided drives are incompatible with its enclosure, a real physical constraint that could exclude popular high-performance SSD models you might already own or be considering, similar to the width-based exclusions seen on other Mac mini dock enclosures. This matters directly if you already own or are shopping for a specific SSD with a heatsink, where checking this compatibility first avoids purchasing an incompatible dock, and matters less if you're buying a bare SSD without a heatsink specifically for this enclosure. Check a dock's specific stated SSD compatibility exclusions (heatsink presence, double-sided design, or physical dimensions) against your exact SSD model before assuming any M.2 NVMe SSD will fit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cooling Design That Avoids Obstructing the Mac mini's Own Fan Prevents a Compounding Heat Problem",
    "explanation": "The Satechi pick's cooling design specifically uses heat-dissipating bottom vents and a recessed top engineered not to obstruct the Mac mini's own internal fan, a thoughtful design consideration since a poorly designed dock could trap heat around the Mac mini itself and worsen its own thermal performance in addition to the dock's storage enclosure heat. This matters if you run the Mac mini under sustained heavy workloads where both the Mac mini's own cooling and the dock's storage cooling need to work effectively together, and matters less for light, intermittent use where heat buildup from either source is rarely a practical issue. Check whether a dock's cooling design specifically accounts for not obstructing your Mac mini's own airflow, not just cooling the dock's own storage enclosure independently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Power Button Lever or Similar Physical Convenience Detail Reflects Genuine Attention to Daily Use",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN pick's power button lever specifically lets you turn on your Mac mini without physically lifting it off the dock, a small but genuinely useful convenience detail for a device you'll interact with daily, reflecting thoughtful design attention beyond just raw storage and port specifications. This matters if daily ease-of-use details genuinely improve your experience with the dock, and matters less if you rarely need to manually power on the Mac mini since it's usually left running or set to auto-wake. Consider small daily convenience features like power button access alongside the core storage and connectivity specs when comparing otherwise similar Mac mini docks."

  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Mac mini Thunderbolt dock?", "a": "Assuming the dock's advertised Thunderbolt generation and Gbps rating alone determines real-world storage speed, without checking whether their specific SSD's own PCIe generation and NVMe version can actually deliver that theoretical maximum." },
  { "q": "Is RAID 0 on the ACASIS dock safe for storing important files?", "a": "RAID 0 combines two drives for maximum capacity and speed but provides no data redundancy, meaning a single drive failure causes complete data loss across both drives, so maintaining a separate backup of any critical files is strongly recommended rather than relying on RAID 0 alone." },
  { "q": "Can I use an SSD with a heatsink in the Satechi Mac mini dock?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states SSDs with heatsinks or double-sided drives are incompatible with this specific enclosure, so checking your SSD's exact specifications against this limitation is essential before purchase." },
  { "q": "Does the Wokyis dock's 5-inch display require separate software to use?", "a": "The built-in display is designed for basic functions like notifications, monitoring, and simple content display such as a clock or photo frame, though checking the manufacturer's specific setup instructions for full functionality is worth doing after purchase." },
  { "q": "Do these Mac mini docks work with older Mac mini models like the M1 or M2?", "a": "Most of these picks specifically state compatibility with M4, M5, or M6 chip Mac mini models and are precision-molded to match that specific generation's physical dimensions, so checking each listing's stated compatible Mac mini generations against your exact model is essential before purchase." }
