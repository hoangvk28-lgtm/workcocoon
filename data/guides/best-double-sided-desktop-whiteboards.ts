Every board below is confirmed double-sided per its own listing, and we flag where the second side's content or template isn't detailed, so check listing images if that specific detail matters to you.",
  "Double-sided construction also adds some weight and thickness compared to a single-sided board, and if the board rotates within its stand, that rotation mechanism is a real durability point that unboxing photos can't confirm holds up over repeated use.
