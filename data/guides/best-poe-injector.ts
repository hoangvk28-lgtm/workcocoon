export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The 802.3af vs 802.3at Standard Determines Which Devices an Injector Can Actually Power",
    "explanation": "The 802.3af standard delivers up to 15.4W at the source (about 12.95W at the device after cable loss), while 802.3at (PoE+) delivers up to 30W, and connecting a device that needs 30W to a 15.4W-only injector simply won't power it correctly or will cause it to behave erratically. This matters significantly for PTZ cameras, newer Wi-Fi 6/6E access points, and some VoIP phones with screens, all of which typically draw more than 15.4W and require an 802.3at-rated injector. Check your device's own spec sheet or power label for its exact wattage draw, then match it against the injector's stated maximum output rather than assuming any PoE injector works with any PoE device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Gigabit Port Speed Prevents a PoE Injector From Becoming the Slowest Link in Your Network",
    "explanation": "A PoE injector with only 100Mbps ports will cap the connected device's network speed at 100Mbps even if every other component in your network supports Gigabit speeds, effectively creating a bottleneck at that one point. This matters if you're powering a high-resolution IP camera streaming 4K footage or any device that benefits from faster data transfer, and matters less for a basic VoIP phone or low-resolution camera where 100Mbps is already more than sufficient. Check the injector's listed port speed specifically, since some budget listings only state PoE compliance without clearly stating whether the ports are Gigabit or Fast Ethernet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A PoE Injector's Stated Electrical Protections Reduce Real Risk of Damage to Connected Equipment",
    "explanation": "Features like over current protection, over load protection, and over voltage protection are circuit-level safeguards that prevent a power fluctuation or wiring fault from damaging the connected camera, phone, or access point, and their absence from a listing doesn't necessarily mean they're missing, but a listing that explicitly names them gives you more confidence than one that doesn't mention safety features at all. This matters more in environments with less stable power, like older buildings or outdoor installations, and matters less in a controlled office environment with clean, stable power. Look for a listing that explicitly names its electrical protections in the bullet points rather than assuming all injectors include the same safeguards."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UL Certification Signals Independent Safety Verification, Not Just a Manufacturer's Own Claim",
    "explanation": "UL certification means an independent testing organization has verified the product meets defined electrical safety standards, which is a meaningfully different level of assurance than a manufacturer simply stating their product is safe in the listing copy. This matters more for a permanent installation in a wall or ceiling where fire safety is a real consideration, and matters less for a temporary desktop setup where you're more focused on data throughput than long-term electrical safety certification. Check the listing title and bullet points for an explicit UL, ETL, or similar certification mark rather than assuming generic PoE compliance implies third-party safety testing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Included Ethernet Cable Saves a Second Purchase but Isn't Universal Across Listings",
    "explanation": "Some PoE injector listings bundle a short Ethernet cable, typically 3 feet, meant to connect the injector to your switch or router, while others expect you to already have a compatible cable on hand, and assuming a cable is included when it isn't means your installation stalls until you source one separately. This matters more for a first-time buyer setting up a single device who wants everything in one box, and matters less for anyone who already has spare Ethernet cables around from previous networking work. Check the listing's bullet points and included-items section specifically for the word cable before assuming one comes in the box."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the difference between a PoE injector and a PoE switch?", "a": "A PoE injector adds power to a single existing non-PoE network port, while a PoE switch has multiple built-in PoE ports and replaces your existing switch entirely, so an injector is the simpler and cheaper choice for powering just one or two devices." },
  { "q": "Can I use a 30W 802.3at injector with a device that only needs 15.4W?", "a": "Yes, higher-power 802.3at injectors are backward compatible with 802.3af devices and will typically auto-detect the lower power requirement, so a 30W injector safely powers a 15.4W device." },
  { "q": "Is it worth paying extra for a UL-certified PoE injector?", "a": "For a permanent installation, especially indoors or near flammable materials, UL certification provides independent safety verification that's worth the modest price difference over an uncertified budget option." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my IP camera needs 802.3af or 802.3at power?", "a": "Check your camera's own product specification sheet or power label for its exact wattage draw; PTZ cameras and cameras with heaters or IR illuminators typically need 802.3at's 30W, while fixed basic cameras usually work fine on 802.3af's 15.4W." },
  { "q": "What's the maximum distance a PoE injector can power a device?", "a": "Standard PoE injectors are rated for up to 100 meters (328 feet) over standard Ethernet cable, consistent with the Ethernet standard's own distance limit, beyond which you'd need a repeater or extender rather than a longer run." },
  { "q": "Does a PoE injector need Gigabit ports for a basic security camera?", "a": "A basic single security camera typically works fine with 100Mbps, but Gigabit ports future-proof the injector for higher-resolution cameras or additional bandwidth-hungry devices you might add later." }
