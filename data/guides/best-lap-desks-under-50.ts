export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Genuine Active Cooling Fan Solves a Real Heat Problem That Passive Heat Shields Only Partially Address",
    "explanation": "The Cooling Fan pick's USB-powered fan actively moves air to dissipate heat, a fundamentally different approach from the passive heat shield materials used by the other picks in this comparison, which simply create a barrier between the laptop and your lap without actively removing generated heat. This distinction matters most if your laptop runs notably hot during demanding tasks like video editing or gaming, where passive heat shielding alone may not adequately manage the heat output, while an active fan directly addresses the problem by moving warm air away. Consider your laptop's actual heat output and typical usage intensity before assuming passive heat shielding provides equivalent protection to genuine active cooling."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Hidden Storage Drawer Provides Genuinely Different Organization Than an Open Cup Holder or Device Slot",
    "explanation": "The Potuopy pick's large-capacity hidden drawer specifically conceals pens, phones, mice, and small accessories out of sight, a different organizational approach from the open cup holders and device slots on the SONGMICS and Zapuno picks, which keep items visible and immediately accessible but also exposed. This matters if you prefer a clean, clutter-free desk appearance with items tucked away versus quick, visible access to frequently used items without opening anything. Consider whether you prefer concealed storage or open, immediately visible storage before assuming any storage feature serves the same organizational purpose."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Lifetime Warranty at This Price Point Represents Genuine Manufacturer Confidence Worth Weighing Seriously",
    "explanation": "The Potuopy pick's lifetime warranty is a meaningfully stronger commitment than the other picks in this comparison, which don't state comparable long-term warranty coverage, and this matters given that a lap desk with moving joints, hinges, and folding mechanisms experiences real mechanical wear over years of regular use. A lifetime warranty suggests the manufacturer has genuine confidence in the product's long-term durability against this kind of mechanical wear. Weigh a documented lifetime warranty as a real value factor when otherwise similar picks are priced closely, since this difference reflects genuine variation in manufacturer confidence and buyer protection over years of use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In USB Ports on a Lap Desk Consolidate Charging in a Way Separate Chargers Cannot",
    "explanation": "The Zapuno pick's 4 USB ports, powered by a single USB cable, let you charge your phone and other small devices directly from the lap desk itself without needing separate wall chargers or extension cords running to your seating area, a genuine convenience consolidation for anyone who frequently charges multiple devices while working from a couch or bed. A lap desk without this feature, like the Potuopy or SONGMICS picks, still functions perfectly as a work surface but requires separate charging solutions for your devices. Consider whether consolidating device charging into your lap desk itself would meaningfully simplify your typical setup versus using existing separate chargers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated Weight Capacity Differences of 25 Pounds or More Reflect Genuinely Different Structural Engineering",
    "explanation": "The Cooling Fan pick's 80 lb weight capacity substantially exceeds the SONGMICS pick's 55 lb rating, despite both using metal or aluminum leg construction, suggesting genuinely different structural engineering choices in leg thickness, joint design, or material grade between the two products. This matters if you plan to place unusually heavy equipment on the lap desk, such as a heavy gaming laptop combined with additional peripherals, where the higher-rated pick provides more safety margin. Compare specific stated weight capacities directly rather than assuming similar-looking metal leg construction implies comparable load-bearing engineering across different products."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the Cooling Fan pick's fan work without being plugged into the laptop?", "a": "No, it requires a USB connection to your laptop to draw power and operate, so it won't function as a standalone fan disconnected from a device." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing storage features across lap desks?", "a": "Assuming an open cup holder or device slot provides the same organizational benefit as a hidden drawer, when a concealed drawer like the Potuopy pick's keeps small items out of sight for a cleaner appearance, while open slots keep items visible and quickly accessible instead." },
  { "q": "Is the Potuopy pick worth the price premium over the cheaper Zapuno pick?", "a": "If a hidden storage drawer and a lifetime warranty matter most to you, yes, but if built-in USB charging ports at a lower price is your priority, the Zapuno pick delivers that specific feature for about $19 less." },
  { "q": "Can the SONGMICS pick's swivel cup holder be used safely at any tilt angle?", "a": "The listing specifically advises against using the cup holder when the desk is tilted, since items may slip off at an angle, so keep the desk relatively flat when using that specific feature." },
  { "q": "How do I know if I actually need the Cooling Fan pick's active cooling versus a passive design?", "a": "If your laptop noticeably heats up during extended use or demanding tasks like gaming or video editing, active cooling provides genuine additional heat management, but for lighter everyday use like browsing or word processing, a passive heat shield design is typically sufficient." },
  { "q": "Do these lap desks require any tools or assembly to set up?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison are designed for no-assembly, ready-to-use operation right out of the box, simply requiring you to unfold the legs and adjust to your preferred height and angle." }
