export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Named Ergonomic Brand Provides Accountability That a Generic Manufacturer Listing Often Doesn't",
    "explanation": "The Autonomous ErgoChair Core is backed by a company that specializes specifically in ergonomic office furniture and documents clear warranty terms and support channels, while the GABRYLLY, CAPOT, and HUANUO picks in this comparison are sold under product-specific names without the same established brand infrastructure behind customer service or long-term support. This doesn't mean the generic-manufacturer chairs are lower quality, since several cite equal or stronger certifications and warranties, but a recognized brand typically offers more predictable long-term support if something goes wrong years down the line. Weigh whether brand-name accountability specifically matters to you versus the often better price-per-feature ratio generic manufacturers provide at this tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Genuine Retractable Footrest Changes How a Chair Functions During Breaks, Not Just During Work",
    "explanation": "The GABRYLLY pick's steel footrest extends to a stated 18.1 inches, letting the chair function as an actual napping or relaxation spot during breaks, a real capability the other picks in this comparison, including the more expensive Autonomous ErgoChair Core, don't offer at all. This matters specifically if you work long hours at home and want your chair to double as a rest spot rather than needing to move to a separate couch or bed for breaks. Check whether a footrest is genuinely retractable and rated for stable leg support, not just a decorative extension, before assuming any chair labeled with a footrest offers comparable functionality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dual-Backrest X-Frame Design Targets Upper and Lower Back Support as Two Separate Structural Zones",
    "explanation": "The Autonomous ErgoChair Core's dual-backrest X-frame physically separates upper and lower back support into two distinct structural zones, a genuinely different engineering approach from the single continuous mesh backrest used by every other pick in this comparison. This design specifically aims to reduce pressure points by letting each zone flex somewhat independently rather than relying on one uniform curve to serve both areas simultaneously. Consider whether you've previously found single continuous backrests uncomfortable in a specific zone, since a dual-frame design specifically addresses that kind of localized discomfort differently than a standard mesh back."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multiple Certifications Cited Together Signal More Comprehensive Testing Than Either Certification Alone",
    "explanation": "The GABRYLLY pick specifically cites both SGS and BIFMA testing for its frame, while other picks in this comparison cite only one or the other, and having both suggests the manufacturer pursued both a general safety and quality verification and the more structurally specific durability testing rather than relying on a single certifying body's scope. This dual-certification approach doesn't guarantee superiority in every dimension, but it does represent a more thorough documented testing process than a chair citing just one credential. Check whether a listing names multiple independent certifications together, since this combination provides broader verification than any single certification alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight Capacity and Price Don't Move Together in a Straightforward Line at This Tier",
    "explanation": "The CAPOT pick offers the highest weight capacity in this entire comparison at 400 lbs for under $200, while the pricier Autonomous ErgoChair Core is rated for only 242 lbs, demonstrating that a higher price at this tier often reflects brand backing, distinct structural design, or footrest functionality rather than simply higher weight capacity. Assuming price scales directly with weight capacity across this comparison would lead you to overlook the CAPOT's genuinely strong capacity-to-price ratio. Compare weight capacity as an independent factor from price, rather than assuming the most expensive chair in a lineup automatically supports the most weight."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the Autonomous ErgoChair Core worth the price premium over the CAPOT pick's higher weight capacity?", "a": "If a recognized ergonomic brand's dual-backrest design and documented warranty support matter to you, yes, but if raw weight capacity and value are your priority, the CAPOT pick offers 400 lbs of capacity and a 5-year warranty for about $100 less." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing footrest-equipped chairs at this price?", "a": "Assuming any reclining chair includes a genuine footrest, when only the GABRYLLY pick in this comparison specifically includes a retractable steel footrest rated for stable leg support during recline." },
  { "q": "Does a chair without a named consumer brand mean lower build quality?", "a": "Not necessarily, since the CAPOT and GABRYLLY picks both cite strong independent certifications like BIFMA X5.1 and SGS testing, credentials that speak to genuine build quality regardless of whether a recognizable brand name is attached." },
  { "q": "How do I decide between the GABRYLLY footrest chair and the Autonomous dual-backrest chair?", "a": "If you want to use your chair as a rest spot during breaks, the GABRYLLY's genuine retractable footrest serves that need directly, while the Autonomous pick's dual-backrest design instead focuses on separating upper and lower back support without any footrest functionality." },
  { "q": "Can the HUANUO chair really compete with the pricier picks in this comparison on ergonomics?", "a": "For core lumbar and armrest adjustment precision, yes, its 1.18 and 2.16 inch lumbar range and 3D armrests match the exact specifications found on much pricier competitors, though it lacks the footrest, dual-backrest frame, or named brand backing of the top picks." },
  { "q": "What should I check before assuming a chair's recline locks at a fixed angle?", "a": "Look specifically for stated lock positions like 90, 110, or 135 degrees in the listing, since some chairs only tilt and automatically return upright rather than genuinely locking in place at a chosen recline angle." }
