export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "24V Passive PoE and Standard 802.3af/at PoE Cannot Be Substituted for Each Other",
    "explanation": "A passive PoE injector applies a constant 24V to specific Ethernet wire pairs with no negotiation, while standard 802.3af/at PoE performs a detection handshake before delivering power at 48V, and every listing in this comparison explicitly warns that it does not work with 48V standard PoE devices. This matters because connecting a passive 24V injector to a device expecting standard PoE negotiation typically results in no power at all, and in some cases connecting the wrong voltage type can risk damaging sensitive equipment. Check your specific device's power specification for whether it explicitly states 24V passive PoE or 802.3af/at standard PoE before purchasing either type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Compatibility With a Specific Original Manufacturer Part Number Removes Real Uncertainty",
    "explanation": "Several listings in this comparison specifically name the exact Ubiquiti part numbers they replace, like POE-25-5W, POE-24-12W, and POE-24-24W, which lets you confirm compatibility by matching your original adapter's part number rather than guessing based on voltage and wattage alone. This matters significantly if you're replacing a lost or broken original adapter for a specific device, and matters less if you already know your device's exact voltage and wattage requirements independently. Check your original adapter's printed part number, if you still have it, against a listing's stated compatibility before assuming a generic 24V match is sufficient."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DC Input Flexibility Matters Specifically for Solar, Battery, and Remote Installations Without Standard AC Power",
    "explanation": "Most passive PoE injectors expect a standard AC wall outlet, but a solar panel, battery bank, or vehicle power system delivers variable DC voltage that a standard AC-powered injector can't accept directly, requiring a unit specifically designed to accept and regulate a wide DC input range instead. This matters significantly for remote point-to-point radio links, solar-powered security cameras, or RV and boat installations with no grid power access, and matters not at all for a standard indoor installation near an AC outlet. Check for an explicit DC input voltage range in the listing if your installation doesn't have access to standard AC power."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Gigabit vs 100Mbps Speed Still Applies at the 24V Passive Tier, Independent of the Voltage Type",
    "explanation": "Just as with standard 802.3af/at injectors, a 24V passive injector can be limited to 100Mbps or support full Gigabit speeds, and this is a completely separate consideration from the voltage and wattage specs that define the passive PoE category. This matters if your specific device, like a higher-bandwidth access point, benefits from Gigabit throughput, and matters less for a basic 100Mbps camera or radio link that never approaches Gigabit speeds anyway. Check the listing's stated port speed specifically rather than assuming all 24V passive injectors share the same data rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Explicit Incompatibility Warning in a Listing Is a Genuine Safeguard, Not Just Legal Boilerplate",
    "explanation": "Multiple listings in this comparison explicitly and prominently warn that the product does not support 48V or 802.3af PoE devices, which is a meaningfully clearer signal than a listing that simply states its own voltage without addressing what it won't work with. This matters because a passive PoE product category has a real, common failure mode of buyers assuming any PoE injector works with any PoE device, and a listing that proactively addresses this reduces the odds of an incompatible purchase. Treat an explicit incompatibility warning as a positive signal of listing accuracy rather than skipping past it as boilerplate."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the difference between 24V passive PoE and standard PoE?", "a": "Passive PoE applies a constant voltage to specific wire pairs with no negotiation, common on older Ubiquiti and airMAX hardware, while standard 802.3af/at PoE performs a detection handshake at 48V, and the two are not interchangeable." },
  { "q": "Can I use a 24V passive injector with a standard IP camera?", "a": "Only if your camera specifically supports 24V passive PoE; most modern IP cameras use standard 802.3af/at PoE at 48V and require a different injector type entirely." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my Ubiquiti device needs a 24V passive injector?", "a": "Check the device's original power adapter or its product specification page; older UniFi and airMAX hardware commonly uses 24V passive PoE, while newer UniFi devices increasingly support standard 802.3af/at PoE." },
  { "q": "Can a 24V passive PoE injector run on solar power?", "a": "A standard AC-powered passive injector cannot, but a specifically designed DC-input unit, like the PoE Texas pick in this comparison, accepts a wide voltage range from a solar panel or battery source." },
  { "q": "Is Gigabit speed available for 24V passive PoE injectors?", "a": "Yes, though it's less common than at 100Mbps; the EN15G-24-3 pick in this comparison specifically offers Gigabit speed while keeping the 24V passive power delivery method." },
  { "q": "What happens if I connect a 24V passive device to a 48V standard PoE injector?", "a": "It typically won't power on at all since the voltage and negotiation method don't match, though the specific outcome depends on the device's own input protection circuitry." }
