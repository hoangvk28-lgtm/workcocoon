    "q": "Do I need special drivers to use a drawing tablet on drawing tablets for laptop?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Can driver conflicts happen if I own tablets from different brands?",
    "a": "Yes, this is a known issue. Uninstall other brands' tablet drivers before installing a new one, and reboot, to avoid pointer or pressure conflicts between competing driver software."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."

    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
