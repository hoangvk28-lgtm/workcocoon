  "Most standing desk listings on Amazon never state how many legs the frame actually has. Product titles lean on generic phrases like dual motor, T-shaped legs, or adjustable height, none of which tell you whether you are looking at a 4-leg frame or the far more common 2-leg C-frame or T-frame design. We checked the listing copy for all 8 picks below and confirmed that none of them explicitly state a genuine 4-leg frame, so we are not going to claim otherwise just to match a search term.",
  "A useful rule of thumb: dual-motor electric frames, which make up most of this list, are almost always built as a 2-leg design with one motor per leg, not a 4-leg frame. A true 4-leg frame is a distinct stability-focused design, and if that is specifically what you want, the safest way to confirm it is by looking at the actual product photos and reading the Q&A section, not by trusting title keywords. Below we cover 8 frames worth considering for a small home office, including one rolling cart alternative for anyone who would rather skip a fixed frame altogether.",

    "explanation": "Listings for a standing desk frame often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the standing desk frame holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this standing desk frame over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any standing desk frame you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A standing desk frame that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "Is any of these 8 picks a confirmed 4-leg standing desk?",
    a: "No. We checked all 8 listings directly and none of them explicitly confirm a genuine 4-leg frame. Several use terms like dual motor or T-shaped legs, which describe features of a standard 2-leg design, not a 4-leg frame. If a true 4-leg frame is a hard requirement, check product photos and the Q&A section yourself before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I tell if a standing desk frame has 2 legs or 4 legs from an Amazon listing?",
    a: "Titles and bullet points rarely state leg count directly. The most reliable method is looking at the actual product photos for four independent vertical legs, and checking whether any buyer has asked about leg configuration in the Q&A section. Do not assume dual motor, T-shaped legs, or 3-stage lift columns mean 4-leg, since all of those commonly describe standard 2-leg frames.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Techni Mobili a standing desk frame?",
    a: "No, it is a rolling laptop cart on casters, not a fixed 2-leg or 4-leg frame. It offers manual sit-to-stand height adjustment and storage at a much lower price than a bolted frame, making it a reasonable alternative for laptop-only setups or renters who cannot install a fixed frame, but it should not be compared directly to a stationary frame's stability or capacity.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a higher weight capacity mean a more stable desk?",
    a: "Not necessarily. Rated capacity measures how much weight a frame can hold, not how much it wobbles at full height. A simple glass-of-water test at maximum height, watching for ripples, gives a better sense of real-world stability than the capacity number alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a 4-motor frame instead of a 2-motor frame?",
    a: "For most home office setups under roughly 150 pounds of combined load, a 2-motor frame is sufficient. If you are running a heavier or off-center setup, like a dual-monitor arm mounted to one side, a frame with a higher rated capacity or stiffer construction is worth the extra cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does assembly take for these frames?",
    a: "Simpler frame-only kits typically take 30 to 45 minutes for one person. Full desk-and-frame combos, like the FLEXISPOT E6 and its bamboo version, involve more bolts and can take 60 to 90 minutes, and are easier to assemble with a second person.",
