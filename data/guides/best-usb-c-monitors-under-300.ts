export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "4K and 120Hz Together Requires More USB-C Bandwidth Than Either Alone",
    "explanation": "Displaying 4K resolution at a 120Hz refresh rate requires significantly more data bandwidth than either 4K at 60Hz or 1440p at 120Hz individually, which is part of why this combination costs more and appears less often at lower price points. Before buying a monitor specifically for this combination, like the Dell pick in this comparison, confirm your laptop's USB-C port and cable both support enough bandwidth (typically DisplayPort 1.4 or newer) to actually drive the full 4K 120Hz signal, since a lower-spec connection may fall back to a reduced resolution or refresh rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pantone Validation and Calman Verification Test Different Things",
    "explanation": "Calman Verified certification confirms a display meets specific measured color accuracy targets, like a stated Delta E figure, using an industry-standard calibration and testing tool, while Pantone Validated certification specifically confirms the display accurately reproduces Pantone's own proprietary color reference library. Both indicate genuine, tested color accuracy rather than marketing language, but if your work specifically involves matching Pantone colors for branding or print design, the Pantone-specific certification is the more directly relevant one to look for."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Monitor With Multiple USB-C Ports Can Replace a Separate Docking Station",
    "explanation": "Some monitors in this price range, like the ViewSonic ColorPro pick, include not just one upstream USB-C port for your laptop connection but additional downstream USB-C and USB-A ports for connecting other accessories, effectively functioning as a USB-C hub or docking station built into the monitor itself. This can eliminate the need for a separate dock or hub device, a real cost and desk-space savings worth factoring in in addition to the monitor's own price when comparing options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DisplayPort Daisy-Chaining Has a Real Maximum Display Limit, Not Unlimited Expansion",
    "explanation": "Daisy-chaining lets you connect one monitor to your computer and then link additional monitors from that first one using DisplayPort, but each daisy-chain setup has a stated maximum number of displays it supports, generally limited by available bandwidth, commonly up to four displays at lower resolutions or fewer at 4K. Check the specific stated maximum for your chosen monitor and resolution combination before planning a large multi-monitor workstation around daisy-chaining alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Re-Engineered or Upgraded Built-In Speakers Still Won't Match Dedicated Audio Equipment",
    "explanation": "Some listings in this range describe improved or re-engineered internal speakers with better output power and frequency response compared to previous generations or basic built-in speakers, and these genuinely sound better for casual video calls and background media than a bare-minimum monitor speaker. However, even an upgraded built-in speaker set is still constrained by the thin physical space inside a monitor's chassis, so don't expect it to replace a dedicated speaker or headset setup for serious audio work or gaming."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I actually get 4K at 120Hz on the Dell S2725QC with any laptop, or does it need a specific connection type?", "a": "You'll need a laptop with a USB-C port that supports enough bandwidth, typically DisplayPort 1.4 or Thunderbolt, to carry the full 4K 120Hz signal. A basic USB-C port without this support may only drive the display at a lower resolution or refresh rate." },
  { "q": "Is Pantone Validation actually necessary for general graphic design work, or only for print and branding?", "a": "Pantone Validation is most directly relevant when your work involves matching specific Pantone reference colors, common in branding, packaging, and print design. For general digital design or photo editing, a Calman Verified Delta E certification, like on the ASUS ProArt pick, provides similarly reliable accuracy." },
  { "q": "Can the ViewSonic VP2766-2K's extra USB-C ports actually replace a separate docking station?", "a": "For many setups, yes, since it includes one 90W upstream port for your laptop plus three additional downstream USB-C and USB-A ports for accessories like external drives or a keyboard and mouse, functioning similarly to a basic USB-C hub or dock." },
  { "q": "What's the practical downside of choosing the largest 4K screen (CUNPU) over a 120Hz option?", "a": "The CUNPU pick's standard 60Hz refresh rate means motion, especially fast cursor movement, gaming, or video, won't look as smooth as it would on the Dell S2725QC's 120Hz panel, though for general office work and static content, this difference is minor." },
  { "q": "How many monitors can I actually daisy-chain from the ASUS ProArt PA278CV?", "a": "The listing states support for up to four connected displays via DisplayPort daisy-chaining, though actual achievable resolution and refresh rate across all four displays depends on your graphics card's total available bandwidth." },
  { "q": "Do I need to buy a separate USB-C cable, or is one included with these monitors?", "a": "Most listings in this comparison, including the ASUS ProArt PA278CV, specifically state that USB-C, HDMI, and power cables are included in the box for immediate setup, though it's worth checking each specific listing to confirm before assuming a cable is included." }
