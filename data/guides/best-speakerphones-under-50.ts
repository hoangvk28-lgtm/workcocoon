export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Simultaneous Dual Connectivity Solves a Real Workflow Problem That Single-Mode Switching Doesn't",
    "explanation": "Simultaneous connectivity, like on the AIRHUG pick, means the speakerphone stays connected to both your computer via USB and your phone via Bluetooth at the same time, so you can take a phone call without disconnecting from an active computer session, while a single-mode design like the Cyber Acoustics pick requires pressing a button to switch between the two. This matters if you regularly juggle both a desk phone workflow and a mobile call workflow throughout the day, since constant manual switching adds friction to something that should be quick. Check the listing specifically for the phrase 'simultaneously' or 'at the same time' regarding Bluetooth and USB, rather than assuming any speakerphone with both connection types supports them concurrently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Daisy Chain Compatibility Is Brand-Specific and Won't Work Across Different Manufacturers",
    "explanation": "Daisy chaining, like the EMEET M0 Plus pick's ability to link with another EMEET unit for up to 16 attendees, requires a manufacturer-specific cable and typically only works between compatible models from the same brand, meaning you can't mix and match a budget unit from one brand with a daisy chain cable meant for another. This matters if you're planning to invest in an expandable system over time, since committing to one brand's ecosystem now locks you into buying compatible units later. Check the listing specifically for which models and cables a given unit's daisy chain feature supports before assuming any two speakerphones can be linked together."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Echo Cancellation Duration in Milliseconds Is a Real Technical Spec Worth Comparing When Available",
    "explanation": "The AIRHUG pick specifically states it cancels up to 400ms of echo length, a concrete technical figure that indicates how well the device suppresses audio reflections bouncing around a room, while most competing budget speakerphones only claim generic 'echo cancellation' without a specific number. This matters more in rooms with hard surfaces like glass or bare walls where echo is a bigger problem, and less in a carpeted, soft-furnished home office where echo is naturally minimal. Check the listing for a specific millisecond figure if you know your room has echo-prone hard surfaces, rather than assuming all 'echo cancellation' claims perform equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery Playtime Figures Assume a Specific Volume Level That May Not Match Your Actual Use",
    "explanation": "The Cyber Acoustics pick's stated 12 hours of battery playtime is specifically measured 'at 2/3 volume', meaning your actual battery life could be shorter if you regularly run the speaker at maximum volume for a larger room, or longer if you keep it quieter for a small desk setup. This matters if you're planning all-day meeting marathons on battery power alone rather than keeping the unit plugged in, since the stated figure is a best-case reference point rather than a guarantee under all conditions. Check the listing's fine print for the volume level a battery claim was measured at, and consider keeping the unit plugged in via USB for any single session longer than a few hours regardless of which pick you choose."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pickup Range in Feet Should Be Matched to Your Actual Room Size, Not Assumed to Cover Any Space",
    "explanation": "The picks in this tier range from a 6 foot pickup radius on the AIRHUG pick, suited for 4-6 people, up to a 3 meter (about 10 foot) radius on the Cyber Acoustics pick, and using a shorter-range unit in a larger conference room means people seated further away may not be picked up clearly. This matters concretely if you're setting up a shared meeting room rather than a single-person desk, where the actual distance from the speakerphone to the furthest attendee needs to fall within the stated pickup range. Measure your actual room's dimensions and expected seating distance from where the speakerphone will sit before choosing based on price alone."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I daisy chain the EMEET M0 Plus with a different brand's speakerphone?", "a": "No, daisy chain functionality is brand-specific and requires an EMEET daisy chain cable connecting to compatible EMEET models like the M3 or Meeting Capsule, so mixing brands won't work." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a speakerphone under $50?", "a": "Assuming a stated attendee capacity, like '4-6 people' or 'up to 16 attendees', works reliably at the far edge of that range in a real room, when actual performance depends heavily on room acoustics and seating distance from the unit." },
  { "q": "Is the EMEET M0 Plus worth it over the cheaper Cyber Acoustics option?", "a": "If you want daisy chain expansion and the longest battery life, yes, but if you just need reliable dual-mode connectivity for small calls without growth plans, the Cyber Acoustics pick covers that for about $15 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the AIRHUG pick's simultaneous Bluetooth and USB connection will work with my specific laptop and phone?", "a": "It's designed to be broadly compatible with major operating systems and most conferencing platforms, but checking your specific laptop's USB-C support and phone's Bluetooth version against the listing's compatibility notes is worth doing before assuming universal compatibility." },
  { "q": "Do any of these speakerphones work without being plugged into power at all?", "a": "The EMEET M0 Plus, AIRHUG, and Cyber Acoustics picks all include rechargeable batteries for cordless Bluetooth use, while the CofunKool pick's listing doesn't specify a standalone battery, suggesting it may rely on USB power." },
  { "q": "Can these budget speakerphones handle a full 8-hour workday of back-to-back calls?", "a": "The EMEET M0 Plus's over 10 hour battery life comes closest to covering a full workday cordlessly, though keeping any of these picks plugged in via USB during extended heavy use avoids battery concerns entirely." }
