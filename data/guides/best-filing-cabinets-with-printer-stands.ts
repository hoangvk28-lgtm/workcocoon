  "A filing cabinet marketed as a printer stand needs a top surface that can actually hold a printer without flexing, and that spec rarely gets the attention it deserves. Inkjet printers typically weigh 12 to 20 pounds, while laser printers commonly run 20 to 40 pounds or more once loaded with paper, so the same cabinet top that comfortably holds one may sag under the other. Footprint matters just as much: a printer that overhangs a narrow cabinet top is an accident waiting to happen if a paper tray gets bumped or a corner takes an unexpected knock.",
  "This guide compares 6 cabinets we evaluated based on product specs and buyer feedback, and we verified from each listing whether it is genuinely marketed as a printer stand rather than a general filing cabinet that happens to have a flat top. Printer vibration during operation is another detail worth planning for, since ongoing vibration can loosen drawer slides over time, and an anti-vibration mat is a cheap fix most buyers never think to add. Prices range from $56.99 for a compact rolling model to $139.99 for a five-drawer wood cabinet.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual steel gauge, not just \"metal\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "A filing cabinet described as \"metal\" can still be built with a thin metal face over a particleboard or MDF core rather than genuine steel construction throughout, and even among fully steel cabinets, gauge thickness (a lower number means thicker, sturdier steel) varies meaningfully between products that look nearly identical in listing photos.\n\nThis matters directly for how the cabinet holds up to years of drawer use and how well it resists denting or flexing under a fully loaded drawer's weight.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated steel gauge number, and be skeptical of the word \"metal\" alone without a gauge figure or a clear description of full-steel versus metal-faced construction."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for full-extension versus partial-extension drawer slides",
    "explanation": "Full-extension drawer slides let a drawer pull completely out of the cabinet body, giving access to files at the very back, while partial-extension slides only pull the drawer out part way, leaving files at the rear harder to reach without leaning or reaching awkwardly into the cabinet.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot for daily usability, especially for a deep drawer holding hanging files toward the back, but rarely gets mentioned clearly in listing bullet points that focus on drawer count instead.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"full-extension\" language, and check reviews for mentions of how far drawers actually pull out in practice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm anti-tip safety features if you have kids, pets, or plan a fully loaded cabinet",
    "explanation": "A filing cabinet with multiple drawers can tip forward if more than one drawer is pulled open at once while loaded with paper, a real safety hazard, and better-designed cabinets include an anti-tip interlock mechanism that physically prevents opening a second drawer while another is already open.\n\nThis matters more in a household with kids or pets who might pull on drawers, or if you plan to keep the cabinet fully loaded with heavy paper files rather than lightly used.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated anti-tip or interlock safety feature, since this detail is frequently omitted from budget cabinet listings entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match hanging file compatibility to your actual folder sizes",
    "explanation": "Not every filing cabinet drawer accommodates both letter-size and legal-size hanging files, some are sized for letter only, and a drawer that looks roomy in a photo may not actually fit the wider legal-size folders many home offices and small businesses still use for certain documents.\n\nThis matters directly if any portion of your filing includes legal-size paperwork, buying based on drawer count or overall cabinet size alone without checking hanging-file compatibility is a common and easily avoidable mistake.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for stated letter and/or legal-size hanging file compatibility, not just the general drawer dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh assembly requirements and real delivered weight before ordering",
    "explanation": "Filing cabinets range from fully assembled units shipped ready to use to flat-packed kits requiring meaningful assembly time and, for a genuinely heavy steel cabinet, more than one person to safely maneuver into place.\n\nThis matters because assembly difficulty and real shipped weight are easy to underestimate from a product photo, and a fully assembled cabinet costs more but eliminates that setup friction and the risk of a DIY assembly not being as sturdy as a factory-built one.\n\nCheck the listing for whether the cabinet ships assembled or requires assembly, and check the stated shipping weight against how much lifting and maneuvering you're actually prepared to handle at delivery."

Stationary, all-metal picks like the Letaya 4 Drawer Lateral are a safer bet for heavier laser printers than lighter fabric-drawer or rolling cabinets.",

  {
    q: "Can printer vibration actually damage a filing cabinet over time?",

  },
  {
    q: "Is a rolling printer stand cabinet less stable than a stationary one?",
    a: "Slightly, especially with a heavier printer on top, since casters raise the unit's height and shift its center of gravity. The DEVAISE Mobile Rolling Printer Stand and GYIIYUO Extended Desktop are both rolling designs best matched to lighter inkjet printers rather than heavy laser units.",

  {
    q: "What happens if my printer overhangs the cabinet top?",

If you want that explicit confirmation, choose one of the picks in this list that states printer stand use directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to plan cable routing before setting up a printer stand cabinet?",
