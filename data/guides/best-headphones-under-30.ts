    q: "Can you get good headphones under $30?",
    a: "Yes, with the right expectations. For ANC, the Soundcore P20i at $20 is a genuine exception. For audio quality, the Koss KPH30i beats wireless options at $50 to $60. For waterproofing, the TOZO T10 with IPX8 at $25 is fully submersible. Trade-offs exist: no multipoint Bluetooth on most, no premium materials, limited ANC strength. But for daily studying, commuting, and calls, all seven picks deliver reliably.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best wireless headphone under $30?",
    a: "The Skullcandy Riff Wireless 2 at about $30 for all-day desk use with 34h battery and multipoint Bluetooth. For earbuds, the Soundcore P20i at $20 adds ANC. For gym and outdoor use, the TOZO T10 at $25 delivers IPX8 waterproofing with a wireless charging case.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do any headphones under $30 have active noise cancellation?",
    a: "Yes, the Soundcore P20i at about $20 has hybrid ANC. It is the only pick in this guide with real ANC. It reduces ambient noise by a meaningful amount for studying in dorms and blocking out background chatter. It does not eliminate noise the way $150 headphones do, but it is a genuine improvement over passive isolation alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are wired headphones better than wireless under $30?",
    a: "For audio quality, wired wins. The Koss KPH30i and Porta Pro Classic both outperform wireless options at two to three times their price because the full budget goes to drivers rather than a Bluetooth chip and battery. For convenience at a desk or commute, wireless is more practical. The right choice depends on whether you prioritize sound or freedom of movement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best headphone under $30 for online classes?",
    a: "The Skullcandy Dime 3 for best microphone quality and multipoint Bluetooth (connect laptop and phone simultaneously). The Skullcandy Riff Wireless 2 for all-day comfort with 34h battery and a built-in mic. Either handles online classes reliably.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the TOZO T10 waterproof enough for swimming?",
    a: "Yes, IPX8 means submersible to 1 meter, which covers swimming in shallow water. However, TOZO does not specifically market the T10 as swimming earbuds, so use appropriate judgment for extended underwater use. For casual gym use, outdoor running in the rain, and accidental water contact, IPX8 is fully reliable.",
