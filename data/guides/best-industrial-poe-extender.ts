export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "DIN-Rail Mounting Compatibility Doesn't Indicate Anything About a Device's Actual Water or Dust Resistance",
    "explanation": "The base Industrial DIN-Rail pick and the Intellinet pick both specifically carry an IP30 rating, which protects against solid objects but provides no specific water resistance, despite both being marketed as 'industrial' and DIN-rail mountable, a real distinction from the IP67-rated TRENDnet picks built for genuine outdoor exposure. This matters significantly if your DIN-rail installation is in a genuinely outdoor or wet-exposed location, where an IP30-rated unit would need additional protection despite its industrial branding. Check the specific IP rating number, not just DIN-rail compatibility or the word 'industrial,' if your installation faces real water or dust exposure beyond a standard indoor control cabinet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE++ Support at 60-80W Serves Genuinely Different Industrial Equipment Than Standard PoE+ at 30W",
    "explanation": "The Intellinet and TRENDnet TI-BE200 picks both specifically support higher-wattage IEEE 802.3bt PoE++ devices at up to 80W and 60W respectively, a substantially higher power tier than the standard 30W IEEE 802.3at support on the other two picks, necessary for demanding industrial equipment like heated enclosures, advanced sensors, or high-power radio equipment. This matters significantly if any device in your industrial installation specifically requires PoE++ power, and matters much less if your equipment operates within standard PoE+ 30W limits. Check your specific industrial device's power requirement against an extender's maximum supported PoE standard before assuming standard PoE+ extenders cover your needs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Grounding Point and Named Electrical Safeguards Provide Real Protection in Electrically Noisy Industrial Environments",
    "explanation": "The Intellinet pick specifically includes short-circuit, overload, and high-voltage safeguards plus a grounding point, while the TRENDnet TI-BE200 specifically states built-in True Surge 4kV protection, both concrete electrical safety features distinct from a device with no stated protection specifications at all. This matters significantly in industrial environments with heavy machinery, motors, or other sources of electrical noise and surge risk, and matters less in a stable, electrically clean office environment. Check for specifically named electrical protection features and grounding provisions if your industrial installation environment has real electrical noise or surge exposure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA and TAA Compliance Are Real Procurement Requirements for Government Industrial Deployments",
    "explanation": "Both TRENDnet picks specifically state NDAA and TAA compliance, meeting federal procurement rules that restrict networking equipment from certain manufacturers for US and Canada government deployments, a genuine legal requirement rather than a marketing checkbox for institutional buyers subject to these rules. This matters significantly if you're purchasing on behalf of a government agency or contractor subject to these procurement restrictions, and matters not at all for a private industrial or commercial installation with no such requirement. Verify whether your specific organization has an NDAA or TAA compliance requirement before assuming any industrial networking hardware purchase needs to meet that standard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Manufacturer Warranty Reflects Real Confidence for Equipment Expected to Run Continuously for Years",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet TI-BE200 pick's specifically stated 3-year TRENDnet Manufacturer Protection meaningfully exceeds the warranty terms of the other picks in this comparison, a real difference in coverage for industrial equipment that typically runs continuously in demanding conditions for years without replacement. This matters if you're installing an extender as permanent industrial infrastructure you expect to run for many years, and matters less if you're comfortable with standard warranty terms for less critical applications. Compare warranty length specifically, not just price or specifications, when an extender will serve as long-term industrial infrastructure rather than a temporary or easily-replaced installation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is an IP30-rated industrial PoE extender safe to install outdoors?", "a": "No, IP30 specifically protects against solid objects but provides no water resistance rating, so for genuine outdoor exposure, an IP67-rated pick like the TRENDnet TI-OE110 or TI-BE200 is the appropriate choice instead." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an industrial PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming 'industrial' branding and DIN-rail compatibility automatically mean outdoor-rated waterproofing, when several industrial extenders specifically carry only an IP30 indoor-only rating despite their rugged marketing." },
  { "q": "Is the TRENDnet TI-BE200 worth the much higher price over the base Industrial DIN-Rail pick?", "a": "If you specifically need both IP67 outdoor durability and PoE++ support up to 60W for demanding equipment, the TI-BE200's higher price is justified, but for a standard indoor 30W installation, the base Industrial DIN-Rail pick delivers that for a fraction of the cost." },
  { "q": "Do I need PoE++ support for standard industrial sensors and cameras?", "a": "Most standard industrial cameras and sensors operate within the 30W IEEE 802.3at PoE+ limit, so PoE++ support at 60-80W is specifically necessary only for higher-power equipment like heated enclosures or advanced radio devices." },
  { "q": "Does NDAA compliance matter for a private industrial installation?", "a": "No, NDAA and TAA compliance are specifically federal procurement requirements relevant to government and some institutional buyers, with no practical relevance for a private commercial or industrial installation." },
  { "q": "Can I daisy-chain these industrial extenders to cover a larger factory floor?", "a": "Yes, both TRENDnet picks specifically support daisy-chaining, with the TI-OE110 reaching 300m across two units and the TI-BE200 reaching 500m across four units, letting you extend coverage across a larger industrial space." }
