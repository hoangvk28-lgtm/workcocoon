The integrated drawer is flush-mounted and moves with the desk surface when you raise or lower it. The USB charging ports (2x USB-A plus 1x USB-C) are embedded at the drawer section, routing phone charging cables away from the desktop surface entirely.

    q: "Does the drawer move when you raise the standing desk?",
    a: "On all seven picks on this list, yes. All picks use built-in frame-integrated drawers that are mounted to the desk crossbeam or surface underside and rise and fall with the desk. This is different from a mobile pedestal placed under the desk - that type of storage stays on the floor when you stand. Verify drawer mounting type on any desk not on this list before purchasing.",

    q: "How much weight can a standing desk drawer hold?",
    a: "The FlexiSpot Comhar drawer is rated at 11 lbs. Most other built-in drawers on this list support a similar range. At 11 lbs, a drawer comfortably holds: a notebook, a phone and cable, a few pens, a small charger, and a set of earbuds. It is not rated for heavy items like a laptop, a full cable bundle, or stacked binders.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the drawer internal height deep enough for notebooks?",
    a: "Most built-in standing desk drawers have an internal height of 3 to 3.5 inches. A standard spiral notebook (0.5\" thick) fits easily. A hardback book (1\" thick) fits. A laptop (0.7\" to 1\" thick) technically fits in some drawers but is not recommended - the weight stresses the drawer slides and limits closing clearance. The drawers on this list are sized for accessories and papers, not electronics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do USB ports in the desk use the desk's main power cable?",
    a: "Yes. The USB ports integrated into desks like the FlexiSpot Comhar draw power through the desk's power cable connection. The desk must be plugged into a wall outlet for the USB ports to function - they are not independently powered. The USB-C port on the Comhar supports data transfer on some models but is primarily intended for charging. Verify charging wattage on the current listing.",

  {
    q: "What is the difference between a standing desk with a drawer and a standing desk with a mobile pedestal?",
    a: "A built-in drawer is mounted to the desk frame and rises with the surface when you stand. A mobile pedestal is a separate cabinet placed under the desk that stays on the floor regardless of desk height. When you raise the desk, a pedestal stays behind - it may be in an awkward position relative to the now-elevated surface. Built-in drawers are more convenient for daily use; mobile pedestals offer more storage capacity but require positioning after every height change.",
