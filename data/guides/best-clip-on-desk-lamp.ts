Standard dorm desks, IKEA tabletops (like LINNMON), and most college-issued desks fall between 0.75-1.5 inches thick -- well within range. If your desk is unusually thick or you're clamping to a round surface like a headboard rail, check the specific clamp specs before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a clip-on lamp with a USB power bank?",
    a: "Yes -- any USB-powered clip lamp will run off a power bank. Useful if you're studying somewhere without an outlet. A 10,000mAh power bank will run most USB clip lamps for 15-20+ hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a clip-on lamp damage my desk or leave marks?",
    a: "Good clip lamps have rubber or silicone padding on the clamp jaws. This prevents scratches on wood and composite surfaces. Avoid metal-jaw clamps with no padding on finished or lacquered desks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a specific color temperature for studying?",
    a: "For studying and reading, 4000K neutral white is the best all-around choice -- it mimics natural daylight without the harshness of cool blue-white light. If you study late at night, switch to 3000K warm white to minimize melatonin suppression and sleep disruption.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are USB clip lamps bright enough for serious work?",
    a: "Yes, for most tasks. USB (5V) lamps typically output 200-500 lumens, which is enough for reading, writing, and computer work. If you need more than 500 lumens (detailed art, technical drawing), look for a plug-in AC lamp with higher wattage.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do LED clip lamps last?",
    a: "Quality LED chips are rated for 20,000-50,000 hours. At 4 hours of daily use, that's 13-34 years. The clamp mechanism and power cable will likely wear out before the LEDs do.",
  },
  {
    q: "My roommate goes to sleep early. Can I use a clip-on lamp without disturbing them?",
    a: "Yes -- this is one of the strongest arguments for a clip-on lamp. The directional nature keeps light focused on your workspace. Position it facing your desk and away from your roommate's side, and use warm-white mode at low brightness. This combination is virtually invisible from the other side of a standard dorm room.",
