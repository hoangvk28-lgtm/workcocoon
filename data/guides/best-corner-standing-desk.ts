    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best corner standing desks (l-shaped) in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best corner standing desks (l-shaped) in 2026 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Are L-shaped standing desks more stable than straight ones?", a: "Not inherently. Stability depends on the motor configuration and frame engineering. A well-built dual-motor straight desk is often more stable than a cheap dual-motor L-shape. For L-shaped desks, a 4-leg or triple-motor configuration provides better stability than a standard 2-motor setup, especially when the desk is loaded with equipment on both sides." },
  { q: "Can I put a corner standing desk against any wall?", a: "Corner standing desks need two walls that meet at a right angle (90 degrees). They do not fit against a single flat wall. Also check that the desk can move vertically without hitting overhead cabinets or shelves. Some L-shaped desks extend 46 to 48 inches at standing height, which can conflict with wall-mounted shelving above the desk." },
  { q: "Do I need a separate cable management system for an L-shaped desk?", a: "Yes, for most setups. L-shaped desks create a natural cable cluster at the corner where two sets of monitor cables, power strips, and charging cables converge. A cable spine or under-desk raceway attached to the frame keeps cables off the floor and prevents tangling when the desk moves up and down. Most desks include basic clips but not a full management system." },
  { q: "What is the difference between a 2-motor and 3-motor L-shaped desk?", a: "A 2-motor L-shaped desk has one motor per vertical leg, two legs total. A 3-motor model adds a third motor at the center corner leg, which gives the frame a third lifting point. The added motor reduces the tilt and lateral wobble that develops in 2-motor L-shapes when one side lifts slightly faster than the other. The difference is most noticeable at maximum standing height with a heavy load." },
  { q: "How long does assembly take for a corner standing desk?", a: "Plan 60 to 90 minutes and bring a second person. The frame requires assembling two separate leg assemblies, attaching the crossbar, connecting the desktop panels at the corner bracket, and routing the motor cables to the keypad. The desktop panels typically weigh 25 to 40 lbs each and are awkward to position alone." },
