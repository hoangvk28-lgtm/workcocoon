export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Understand what removing the number pad actually changes about your posture",
    explanation: "A small keyboard's defining feature is dropping the number pad found on full-size keyboards, and the real benefit isn't just desk space, it's that your mouse can sit directly next to the keyboard's main key cluster instead of several inches further right where a numpad would otherwise be. Ergonomics guidance generally points to this closer mouse position as reducing shoulder strain during long sessions, since you're not reaching as far to the side repeatedly throughout the day. If you frequently use a numeric keypad for data entry work, factor in that a small keyboard removes that function entirely rather than just shrinking it, so check whether your actual workflow needs numpad access before switching."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check the actual connection type, not just \"wireless\" as a label",
    explanation: "Wireless small keyboards in this price range use one of two genuinely different connection methods: a 2.4GHz USB dongle that plugs into a USB-A port, or true Bluetooth that pairs directly without an extra dongle taking up a port. A 2.4GHz dongle keyboard won't connect to a device with no USB-A port at all (some newer laptops and tablets), while true Bluetooth works on any Bluetooth-capable device but can sometimes have a marginally less instant wake-up response than a dedicated USB dongle. Check the listing specifically for \"Bluetooth\" versus \"2.4GHz USB receiver\" language, and confirm your target device has the right kind of port or wireless support before buying."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Decide between disposable batteries and a built-in rechargeable battery",
    explanation: "Wireless keyboards in this category power themselves either through standard disposable batteries (typically AA or AAA) that you replace when they run out, or a built-in rechargeable battery that you top up via a USB or USB-C cable periodically. Disposable batteries mean an instant swap when they die with no waiting, but an ongoing cost and occasional need to have spares on hand, while a rechargeable battery eliminates that ongoing purchase but requires remembering to charge it before it fully depletes, and generally can't be swapped instantly if it dies mid-use. If you want zero downtime and don't mind buying batteries occasionally, disposable is the safer choice; if you'd rather avoid battery purchases and can plan ahead for charging, rechargeable works well."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Look for a named switch mechanism if typing feel matters to you",
    explanation: "Most keyboards in this price range use generic membrane or scissor-switch mechanisms without naming a specific technology, while at least one listing in this comparison names a specific branded switch mechanism (Cherry's own SX scissor switches) directly, giving you a real, comparable spec rather than a vague \"comfortable typing\" claim. A named switch mechanism from an established keyboard manufacturer generally signals more engineering attention to consistent key feel and durability than an unnamed generic switch, though unnamed switches can still feel perfectly comfortable for casual use. If typing feel and long-term key durability matter to you specifically, prioritize a listing that names its actual switch technology."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check for a stated key layout difference before assuming standard touch-typing compatibility",
    explanation: "Compressing a keyboard down in size sometimes means the manufacturer adjusts less commonly used keys, like the Enter key or the arrangement around it, to fit the smaller footprint, and at least one listing in this comparison explicitly warns that its Enter key layout differs from a standard full-size keyboard. If you're a fast touch typist who relies on muscle memory for key positions, this kind of layout change can genuinely slow you down for an adjustment period after switching. Check the listing's description and any layout diagram images carefully for mentions of a non-standard key arrangement before assuming any compact keyboard matches a standard full-size layout exactly."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Will I lose functionality by switching from a full-size keyboard to a small one?",
    a: "The main functional loss is the dedicated number pad, useful for fast numeric data entry. Every other standard key, including function keys and arrow keys, is typically retained on a small keyboard; only the numpad itself is removed to save desk space."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 2.4GHz USB dongle keyboard better than a Bluetooth one?",
    a: "Neither is universally better; they suit different situations. A 2.4GHz dongle needs a free USB-A port but often has a very reliable, low-latency connection. Bluetooth needs no extra port and works with more device types, including tablets, but check that your target device actually has Bluetooth support first."
  },
  {
    q: "How long do disposable batteries typically last in these keyboards?",
    a: "It varies by model and usage, but several listings in this comparison state figures around 6 to 12 months of typical daily use before needing a battery change or recharge. Check the specific listing's stated battery life figure rather than assuming a standard duration across all wireless keyboards."
  },
  {
    q: "Do small keyboards work the same on Mac and Windows?",
    a: "Most wired and wireless small keyboards in this comparison state broad compatibility across Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, though a few keys (like special media or Windows-specific shortcut keys) may not have an equivalent function on macOS. Check the specific listing's stated OS compatibility if cross-platform use matters to you."
  },
  {
    q: "Will a backlit compact keyboard drain a wireless battery faster?",
    a: "Yes, generally. Backlighting requires additional power beyond the keyboard's basic wireless signal, so a backlit wireless keyboard typically has shorter battery life between charges or battery swaps than an otherwise similar non-backlit model. If maximizing battery life matters most, a non-backlit pick is the safer choice."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a small keyboard and a separate full-size numeric keypad together?",
    a: "Yes, this is a common setup for buyers who want the ergonomic mouse-positioning benefit of a small keyboard while still occasionally needing numeric entry. A separate USB or wireless numeric keypad accessory can be added alongside any of the keyboards in this comparison without conflict."
