export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Mixed Open-and-Enclosed Design Solves Two Different Storage Needs at Once",
    "explanation": "The Shintenchi pick's combination of open shelves above and doored cabinets below lets you display your favorite books or decor openly while keeping less attractive items, like documents, cables, or general clutter, hidden and dust-free in the enclosed section. This mixed approach avoids the tradeoff of choosing entirely open or entirely enclosed storage, worth prioritizing if you genuinely have both types of items to store."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Taller Bookcases Need More Robust Anti-Tip Engineering Than Shorter Units",
    "explanation": "A bookcase over 70 inches tall, like the IRONCK and Shintenchi picks in this comparison, has a higher center of gravity and more leverage working against it if it tips, making the specific anti-tip hardware and stability devices these listings describe genuinely more important than on a shorter, lower-profile unit. Before buying a tall bookcase, confirm the listing specifically addresses anti-tip stability rather than assuming height alone doesn't matter for safety."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multiple Height Options on Individual Shelves Provide More Flexibility Than Adjusting the Whole Unit",
    "explanation": "The VASAGLE 5-Tier pick's 3 height options across three of its five shelves let you fine-tune spacing exactly where you need extra room, like accommodating a stack of oversized art books on one tier while keeping tighter spacing elsewhere for paperbacks. This selective adjustability is more useful for a mixed item collection than a bookshelf where all shelves are fixed at one height or where adjustment applies uniformly across the entire unit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Fully Enclosed Cabinet Serves Fundamentally Different Rooms Than an Open Bookcase",
    "explanation": "The VASAGLE Floor Storage Cabinet's fully enclosed 4-door design is explicitly versatile enough for a kitchen, bathroom, or utility room, not just a living room or office, since it doesn't rely on open display appeal the way a bookcase does. If you're shopping for storage that needs to work in a non-traditional bookshelf location, like a bathroom or laundry area, a fully enclosed design like this is worth considering over a display-oriented open bookcase."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Industrial vs Farmhouse vs Shaker Styling Affects Room Fit More Than Function",
    "explanation": "The IRONCK and VASAGLE 5-Tier picks use a clean industrial aesthetic, the Shintenchi pick uses farmhouse styling with distinctive color combinations, and the VASAGLE Floor Cabinet uses classic Shaker design with recessed panels, three genuinely different visual styles that don't affect core storage function but do affect how well each piece fits your existing room decor. Choose based on your room's actual style rather than assuming any bookshelf design works universally."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a 70-inch tall bookcase actually fit in a standard room with 8-foot ceilings?", "a": "Yes, standard 8-foot ceilings measure 96 inches, leaving over 2 feet of clearance above a 70-inch bookcase, though always measure your specific room and account for any ceiling fixtures or sloped ceilings before assuming a comfortable fit." },
  { "q": "Do the enclosed cabinet doors on the Shintenchi and VASAGLE picks lock?", "a": "Based on the listings, neither pick specifically mentions locking doors, so if secure, lockable storage is a requirement, check directly with the seller or look for a dedicated locking cabinet rather than assuming this feature is included." },
  { "q": "Can I use the VASAGLE Floor Storage Cabinet as a bookshelf, or is it only suited for other storage?", "a": "While marketed primarily as a floor storage cabinet, its adjustable shelves can certainly accommodate books if you prefer them stored out of sight rather than on open display, though it won't provide the visual browsing experience of an open bookcase." },
  { "q": "How much of a difference does the VASAGLE 5-Tier's adjustable shelving actually make in practice?", "a": "For a mixed collection of differently sized items, like tall reference books alongside smaller paperbacks or decorative boxes, the adjustable shelving lets you eliminate wasted vertical space between items, meaningfully improving how efficiently you use the bookcase's total capacity." },
  { "q": "Is the IRONCK bookcase sturdy enough for a heavy collection of hardcover books?", "a": "Its stated 22 lb per-shelf capacity accommodates a reasonable number of hardcover books per shelf, though if you have an unusually dense or extensive hardcover collection, distribute the heaviest books across multiple shelves rather than concentrating them on just one or two tiers." },
  { "q": "Does the Shintenchi bookshelf's stability device require professional installation?", "a": "No, it's designed for DIY installation as part of the standard assembly process, typically involving securing a bracket or strap to the wall using basic tools included in the package, similar to the anti-tip kits on the other picks in this comparison." }
