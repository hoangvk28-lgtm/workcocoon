];

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check whether AI or handwriting-conversion features are included or require a subscription",
    "explanation": "Digital notebook brands take genuinely different approaches to their software features: some bundle handwriting-to-text conversion, document summarization, and cloud sync into the purchase price, while others, most notably reMarkable's Connect plan, gate the more advanced versions of these same features behind an ongoing monthly subscription that continues costing money long after the initial purchase.\n\nThis is a real total-cost-of-ownership difference that a one-time hardware price comparison completely misses, since a cheaper device with a required subscription can cost more over two or three years than a pricier device with everything included upfront.\n\nCheck the specific listing and manufacturer's website for whether the features you actually want are included in the base purchase or require an ongoing plan, and factor that recurring cost into your real comparison."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that \"AI\" and \"handwriting conversion\" mean different things across different devices",
    "explanation": "The marketing term \"AI\" gets applied to several genuinely different features across this product category: converting your handwriting into typed text, summarizing a long document or your own notes, organizing notes automatically by topic, or simply offering a chatbot-style writing assistant, and a device marketed heavily around \"AI\" doesn't necessarily include all, or even most, of these specific capabilities.\n\nThis matters because two devices can both claim AI features while actually doing completely different things, so a buyer specifically wanting handwriting-to-text conversion could end up with a device whose \"AI\" feature is actually a summarization tool that doesn't address their actual need at all.\n\nRead the specific feature list rather than the marketing headline, and confirm the device does the exact task you need (handwriting conversion specifically, not just \"AI\" generally) before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the stylus situation: included, sold separately, or requiring a specific model",
    "explanation": "Some digital notebooks include a compatible stylus in the box as part of the purchase price, while others sell the device and stylus as separate purchases, or require a specific proprietary stylus model that isn't interchangeable with a generic capacitive pen, and this distinction can add a meaningful hidden cost on top of the listed device price if you assumed a stylus was included.\n\nBeyond just the cost, stylus quality itself varies in pressure sensitivity, tilt detection, and palm rejection quality, features that matter significantly more for sketching and detailed note-taking than for simple text entry.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for whether a stylus ships in the box, and if writing feel matters to you, look for mentions of pressure levels and palm rejection quality rather than assuming any included stylus performs the same as another."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the export and sync ecosystem, since notes trapped on one device have limited long-term value",
    "explanation": "A digital notebook's real usefulness depends heavily on getting your notes and documents off the device and into a format you can actually use elsewhere, whether that's cloud sync to a phone or computer, export to PDF or Word, or direct integration with a note-taking platform like OneNote or Google Drive, and devices differ meaningfully in which of these paths they actually support natively versus not at all.\n\nThis matters concretely for anyone using the device for professional or academic work where notes need to end up in a shared document, an email, or a specific software ecosystem, since a device with limited export options can leave your handwritten notes effectively stranded on the device itself.\n\nCheck the manufacturer's stated export formats and sync options against the specific software or workflow you actually need to feed notes into, rather than assuming any device syncs to everything."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, especially for newer AI-branded entrants",
    "explanation": "Established digital notebook brands with years on the market carry review counts in the thousands, giving genuine statistical confidence in their ratings, while newer devices, especially ones marketing themselves heavily around AI features to ride current interest in the category, sometimes carry only a few dozen or a few hundred reviews, which is a meaningfully thinner sample to judge long-term reliability and whether the marketed features actually work as claimed.\n\nThis doesn't mean a newer, less-reviewed device is automatically worse, but it does mean the claims on its listing carry less independently verified weight than a device with years of real-world feedback behind it.\n\nWhen comparing an established brand against a newer AI-branded entrant, check both the star rating and the review count together, and weigh a smaller but heavily AI-marketed device's claims more skeptically until more real-world feedback accumulates."
