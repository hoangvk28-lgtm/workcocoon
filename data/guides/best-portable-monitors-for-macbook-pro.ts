  "The biggest thing competing portable-monitor roundups miss for MacBook Pro buyers is that display support depends on chip tier, not the word \"Pro\" on the box. Base M1/M2 13-inch MacBook Pro supports only one external display; M1 Pro/Max, M2 Pro/Max, M3 Pro/Max, and M4 Pro/Max support two external displays without needing clamshell mode. If you're buying a second portable monitor hoping for a third total screen, check your chip tier first, this guide won't repeat that mistake for you.",
  "The 8 picks below are ranked with MacBook Pro's specific quirks in mind: none of them match the built-in display's 120Hz ProMotion or P3/XDR color, so we call out exactly how close (or far) each one gets, plus which ones use full-size HDMI instead of an adapter-dependent mini-HDMI port.",

  {
    "criterion": "Check the refresh rate ceiling for each port separately, not just the headline spec",
    "explanation": "A portable monitor's advertised refresh rate is typically its maximum achievable rate on its best-performing port, usually USB-C using DisplayPort Alt Mode, but the same panel connected over HDMI, especially older HDMI 2.0, frequently caps at a meaningfully lower rate because HDMI 2.0's bandwidth can't sustain the same data throughput as USB-C at higher resolutions.\n\nThis is a genuinely common source of buyer disappointment: someone buys a monitor rated 144Hz specifically to pair with a game console over HDMI, only to discover the HDMI port caps at 120Hz or even 60Hz on that specific model, a distinction the headline spec doesn't disclose.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for per-port refresh rate figures (USB-C rate versus HDMI rate stated separately), and match the port you'll actually use to the rate you actually need, not the single highest number in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your specific source device can actually output above 60Hz before paying extra for a high refresh panel",
    "explanation": "A monitor's refresh rate capability is meaningless if the connected source device can't output a signal above 60Hz in the first place, and this is a genuinely common mismatch: many laptop USB-C ports are data-only or video-limited to 60Hz regardless of Thunderbolt or USB4 branding, and handheld gaming PCs like Steam Deck and ROG Ally specifically output capped at 60Hz over USB-C in their current hardware generation, making a 144Hz-rated monitor's extra capability completely unused for that pairing despite the higher price paid for it.\n\nBefore buying specifically for the refresh rate, check your exact source device's documented maximum output refresh rate over the connection type you'll actually use (not just its general spec sheet), since a monitor's rated capability and your source device's actual output are two entirely separate specifications that both need to support the higher rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that response time (GtG) affects visible motion clarity as much as refresh rate does",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate (how many times per second the image updates) and response time (how quickly individual pixels can change color, commonly measured in milliseconds as gray-to-gray or GtG) are two separate specs that both affect how smooth and clear fast motion looks, and a high refresh rate paired with a slow response time still produces visible ghosting or blur trailing behind fast-moving objects, since the panel can't physically change pixel colors fast enough to keep up with the higher refresh rate's demands.\n\nThis matters because response time is disclosed far less consistently than refresh rate across portable monitor listings, many simply omit it entirely, making direct comparison difficult even when two panels share the same headline refresh number.\n\nCheck specifically for a stated GtG response time in milliseconds, and treat a genuinely high refresh rate spec with some skepticism if the listing doesn't also disclose response time, since the refresh number alone doesn't guarantee smooth-looking motion."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check power delivery and cable requirements, since a portable monitor's convenience depends on how it's actually powered",
    "explanation": "Portable monitors typically draw power either through the same USB-C cable carrying the video signal (single-cable operation, the more convenient setup) or through a separate dedicated power input, and some models support pass-through charging that lets your laptop's own charger power both the laptop and the monitor simultaneously through one connection.\n\nThis matters concretely for actual portability: a monitor requiring two separate cables (one for video, one for power) is meaningfully less convenient to set up and pack away than genuine single-cable operation, undermining part of the appeal of a \"portable\" monitor in the first place.\n\nCheck specifically whether the monitor supports single-cable USB-C operation with your source device, and confirm pass-through charging wattage if you want your laptop's charger to power both devices without needing two outlets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since this category includes both established models and many newer, similar-looking entrants",
    "explanation": "Portable monitors from well-established sellers with years of accumulated sales carry review counts in the thousands, giving genuine statistical confidence in panel quality and long-term reliability, while newer listings, sometimes from the same manufacturer under a different model number or from less established brands entirely, can carry only a handful of reviews despite looking similarly specified and priced.\n\nThis is a real practical concern for a portable monitor specifically because panel defects (dead pixels, backlight bleed, uneven brightness) are a documented failure mode across this category, and a thin review base provides much less confidence that a specific listing's panel quality is consistent across units.\n\nWhen comparing two similarly specified and priced portable monitors, check both the star rating and the review count together, and treat a very small review count as a reason for extra caution even if the rating itself looks strong."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Does my MacBook Pro support two external displays?", a: "Only if it has a Pro or Max chip tier (M1 Pro/Max through M4 Pro/Max), those support two external displays without clamshell mode. Base M1/M2 13-inch MacBook Pro supports only one external display total." },
  { q: "Can any of these monitors match my MacBook Pro's XDR display color?", a: "Not exactly. The VisionOwl 15.6\" 4K pick (rank 2) with its 145% sRGB claim comes closest, but none of these panels carry real HDR/XDR certification, so treat all of them as good-enough, not equivalent, for color-critical work." },
  { q: "Should I buy a 144Hz portable monitor for my MacBook Pro?", a: "It won't hurt, but it won't help either. MacBook Pro's own ProMotion display adapts up to 120Hz, so a 144Hz-rated external monitor driven from your Mac won't look any smoother than a 120Hz one." },
  { q: "Does using a portable monitor use up a Thunderbolt port I need for other things?", a: "Yes. MacBook Pro 14/16-inch models have only 2-3 Thunderbolt 4 ports total, and connecting a portable monitor uses one of them, worth planning around if you also run a dock, eGPU, or fast external SSD." },
  { q: "Which pick has a full-size HDMI port instead of mini-HDMI?", a: "All picks in this guide except the KYY 15.6\" (rank 8) use full-size HDMI. The KYY uses mini-HDMI and requires its included cable or your own adapter." },
  { q: "Can I mount any of these on a monitor arm at my desk?", a: "Most picks in this guide have real VESA mounting holes (75x75mm on several models), letting you attach them to a standard monitor arm instead of relying on a fold-out cover-stand." },
