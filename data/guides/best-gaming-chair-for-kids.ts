export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

  {
    q: "What age is right for a framed gaming chair versus a floor chair?",
    a: "Floor chairs like the GTPLAYER and Best Choice Products models work well for younger kids around ages 3 to 8 who don't need height adjustment and benefit from a lower, more stable seating position. Framed recliners with gas lifts, like the HOFFREE RGB and PUKAMI models, suit kids ages 8 and up who are tall enough to benefit from adjustable seat height and a more chair-like recline.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are RGB LED gaming chairs safe for kids?",
    a: "The HOFFREE RGB model in this guide runs on low-voltage LED lighting built into the chair frame, similar to LED strip lighting used in many kids' bedroom products, and it carries an SGS-rated 100,000 cycle gas lift and 350 lb capacity rating. As with any electronic feature, check that the power connection is a standard low-voltage adapter and keep cords away from where a young child could tug on them.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if a gaming chair will fit my child?",
    a: "Compare your child's current height and weight to the chair's stated seat height range and weight capacity, not just the labeled age range. For example, the PUKAMI's 13.8 to 17.7 inch seat height range works well for shorter teens, while the MINPINSER's 17.3 to 21.3 inch range suits taller kids at a desk. When in doubt, size down on the age range rather than up, since an oversized chair provides less support than a properly fitted one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do kids' gaming chairs need assembly?",
    a: "Framed recliners like the HOFFREE, PUKAMI, and MEENICE models require assembly similar to an adult gaming chair, typically bolting the base, wheels, and backrest together. Floor chairs like the Best Choice Products model are explicitly listed as requiring no assembly, which makes them a faster option if you want something ready to use immediately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a gaming chair for kids double as a homework or desk chair?",
    a: "Recliners with footrests and deep recline ranges, like the HOFFREE RGB, are comfortable for gaming and relaxed screen time but encourage a reclined posture that isn't ideal for focused desk work. The MINPINSER Kids Desk Chair is built specifically for upright homework use with mesh support and an adjustable footrest, making it the better choice if the chair's primary job is studying rather than gaming.",
