export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An '8-Port PoE Extender' Is Almost Always a PoE+ Switch With an Extend Mode Feature, Not a Simple Repeater",
    "explanation": "Every pick in this comparison is technically a PoE+ switch with a dedicated Extend Mode toggle rather than the small, passive passthrough repeaters covered in single-device or 2-port PoE extender categories, since a true 8-port device needs the switching intelligence and port management that only a real switch architecture provides. This matters because searching for an '8-port PoE extender' expecting a simple repeater device could lead to confusion when every real product in that search is actually a managed or unmanaged switch with an extend feature. Understand that at 8 ports, you're evaluating PoE switches with an extend capability, not a passive extender, and factor in switch-specific considerations like total switching capacity and port management alongside the extend feature itself."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Enabling Extend Mode Typically Drops Bandwidth Substantially Across All Ports, Not Just the Extended Ones",
    "explanation": "The Outdoor Waterproof pick specifically discloses that speed drops to just 10Mbps across all ports the moment Extend Mode is enabled, a switch-wide tradeoff rather than a per-port setting that only affects the specific device needing extended range. This matters significantly if you have a mix of nearby devices needing full bandwidth and one or two far-away devices needing extended range, since enabling Extend Mode to reach the far device could unnecessarily throttle bandwidth for every other connected device on the same switch. Check whether a switch's extend mode applies globally across all ports or can be configured per-port, and plan your device layout accordingly if bandwidth matters for your nearby devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Total PoE Power Budget Determines How Many High-Wattage Devices You Can Actually Run Simultaneously Across 8 Ports",
    "explanation": "The TP-Link pick's 65W total PoE budget is meaningfully lower than the STEAMEMO and SICSOLINK picks' 120W budgets, even though all three offer up to 30W per individual port, meaning the TP-Link switch can support fewer simultaneous high-power devices before hitting its total power ceiling. This matters significantly if you're running multiple PTZ cameras or other high-draw devices that each need close to 30W, since a lower total budget switch might not support as many of them running at once as a higher-budget switch would. Compare a switch's total PoE power budget against the combined wattage of all high-power devices you plan to connect simultaneously, not just its per-port maximum rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AI Watchdog and Auto-Recovery Features Reduce Real On-Site Maintenance Trips for Unattended Deployments",
    "explanation": "The SICSOLINK pick's specifically named AI watchdog automatically detects an offline device and restarts its corresponding port without human intervention, a genuinely practical feature for an unattended 24/7 surveillance system where a technician visit to manually power-cycle a frozen camera would otherwise be required. This matters significantly if your switch will be installed somewhere hard to physically access, like a remote pole-mounted enclosure or a locked utility closet, and matters less for an easily accessible switch in your own home office. Check whether a switch specifically names an automatic device recovery or watchdog feature if your deployment is genuinely unattended or hard to physically reach for troubleshooting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Managed vs Unmanaged Switch Architecture Is a Real Tradeoff Between Configuration Complexity and Network Visibility",
    "explanation": "The STEAMEMO pick's specifically stated remote management through a web interface, app, or desktop software provides real network visibility, VLAN configuration, and QoS control that the unmanaged picks in this comparison simply don't offer, but at the cost of a more complex initial setup and ongoing configuration responsibility. This matters if you're managing a growing network where visibility into traffic and device status genuinely helps troubleshoot issues, and matters less for a simple, static camera deployment where plug-and-play operation with zero configuration is more valuable than management features you won't use. Weigh whether you'll actually use a managed switch's configuration and monitoring capabilities before paying for that added complexity over a simpler unmanaged alternative."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is an 8-port PoE extender the same thing as a PoE switch?", "a": "Effectively yes; every real product matching an '8-port PoE extender' search is actually a PoE+ switch with a built-in Extend Mode feature, since achieving 8 ports requires the switching architecture of a genuine switch rather than a simple passive repeater." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an 8-port PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming Extend Mode only affects the specific far-away device needing extended range, when several switches specifically apply the bandwidth reduction across all 8 ports simultaneously once that mode is enabled." },
  { "q": "Is the TP-Link switch worth the higher price over the SICSOLINK pick?", "a": "If you specifically need full Gigabit ports when not using Extend Mode, the TP-Link's higher price is justified, but for a straightforward camera deployment where automatic recovery and long extend-mode range matter more, the SICSOLINK offers strong value at a lower price." },
  { "q": "Do I need a managed switch for a simple home security camera setup?", "a": "For a simple, static camera deployment, an unmanaged switch like the TP-Link, Outdoor Waterproof, or SICSOLINK picks is generally sufficient, while the STEAMEMO's managed features are more valuable for a growing or more complex network needing remote visibility." },
  { "q": "Will enabling Extend Mode on my 8-port switch slow down all my cameras, or just the far-away one?", "a": "On several switches in this comparison, including the Outdoor Waterproof pick, Extend Mode specifically applies its bandwidth reduction across all ports at once, so checking whether your specific switch supports per-port extend configuration is worth doing before enabling it for just one device." },
  { "q": "Can these 8-port switches handle high-power devices like PTZ cameras?", "a": "The STEAMEMO and SICSOLINK picks both offer a 120W total PoE budget with up to 30W per port, generally sufficient for PTZ cameras, though you should confirm the combined wattage of all your connected high-power devices stays within the switch's total budget." }
