export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Outlet Energy Monitoring Provides Actionable Data a Simple On/Off Smart Strip Doesn't",
    "explanation": "Both the Kasa HS300 and Tapo Matter picks let you check exactly how much power each individual connected device draws directly through their respective apps, a genuinely different capability from the Amazon Basics pick, which offers smart on/off control but no consumption data at all. This matters if you're trying to identify which specific device is driving up your electricity bill, since total strip-level consumption alone doesn't tell you whether it's your monitor, a space heater, or a charger causing the increase. Check specifically for per-outlet, not just per-strip, energy monitoring if this level of detail matters to your use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Matter Certification Represents a Genuinely More Future-Proof Smart Home Investment Than Single-Ecosystem Compatibility",
    "explanation": "The Tapo pick's Matter certification means it will work with virtually any major smart home platform, Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, or Samsung SmartThings, without needing to worry about brand-specific compatibility gaps, while the Kasa and Amazon Basics picks are compatible with specific named ecosystems that could change or require workarounds if your household's smart home setup shifts in the future. This matters more the longer you expect to keep the device in use and the more likely your smart home ecosystem might change or expand. Consider your long-term smart home plans, not just your current setup, when weighing Matter certification against narrower ecosystem-specific compatibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Local Control During Internet Outages Is a Meaningful Reliability Feature Not Every Smart Strip Offers",
    "explanation": "The Tapo pick specifically supports local control through your home network, meaning you can still manage its outlets even if your internet connection goes down, a genuine reliability advantage over a smart strip that depends entirely on cloud connectivity to function remotely. This matters if you're using the strip for something time-sensitive or safety-relevant, like a space heater or sump pump, where losing remote control during an outage could be a real inconvenience or risk. Check whether a listing specifically mentions local network control versus requiring constant internet access for every feature to function."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Broader Voice Assistant Support Matters Only if You Actually Use Multiple Voice Platforms",
    "explanation": "The Kasa HS300's support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana is broader than the Tapo's support for the major platforms without explicit Cortana mention, but this distinction matters only if you specifically use Cortana or multiple voice assistants across different devices in your household. For the vast majority of buyers using just Alexa or just Google Home, this difference is largely irrelevant, and the broader support shouldn't be the deciding factor over more impactful features like energy monitoring depth or Matter certification. Evaluate voice assistant breadth against your actual, current usage rather than treating more supported platforms as inherently better."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Genuinely Metal-Housed Strip Without Smart Features Can Still Be the Right Choice for Certain Environments",
    "explanation": "The CRST 8-Outlet pick deliberately trades smart connectivity and energy monitoring for aluminum alloy construction and instant physical switches, a genuinely better fit for a workshop or garage where WiFi reliability might be poor, hands might be dirty or gloved, or immediate physical control matters more than remote scheduling. Choosing a smart strip for this kind of environment doesn't automatically make it the better pick if the practical realities of the space favor simple, reliable physical switches over an app-dependent interface. Match your strip choice to your actual physical environment and workflow, not just the most feature-rich option on paper."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the real difference between the Kasa HS300 and the Tapo Matter power strip?", "a": "Both offer per-outlet energy monitoring and 6 smart outlets, but the Tapo is Matter-certified for broader smart home platform compatibility including Apple HomeKit and SmartThings, while the Kasa offers slightly broader voice assistant support including Microsoft Cortana." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a smart power strip?", "a": "Assuming any smart strip offers energy monitoring, when some, like the Amazon Basics pick, provide smart on/off control and scheduling but no actual per-outlet consumption data at all." },
  { "q": "Is the Tapo Matter pick worth it over the cheaper Amazon Basics smart strip?", "a": "If you want per-outlet energy monitoring, local control during internet outages, and broader smart home platform compatibility beyond just Alexa, yes, but if you just need basic hub-free smart on/off control, the Amazon Basics pick covers that for about $2 less." },
  { "q": "Does the CRST 8-Outlet metal strip work with any smart home features at all?", "a": "No, it's built specifically around physical switches and rugged metal construction rather than smart connectivity, making it a better fit for a workshop or garage where instant physical control matters more than app-based scheduling." },
  { "q": "How does Matter certification actually benefit me if I already use Alexa?", "a": "Matter certification means the strip will continue working seamlessly even if you later add Google Home, Apple HomeKit, or SmartThings devices to your home, or switch primary ecosystems entirely, without needing to replace the strip itself." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Kasa or Tapo smart strips without an internet connection at all?", "a": "The Tapo specifically supports local control through your home network during internet outages, while the Kasa's remote features depend on cloud connectivity, though basic physical outlet function on both continues regardless of internet status." }
