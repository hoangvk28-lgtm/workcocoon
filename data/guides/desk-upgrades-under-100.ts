    q: "Is a gas-spring monitor arm worth the extra $15-20 vs a friction arm?",
    a: "Yes, unambiguously. Gas-spring arms float -- you reposition with one hand, let go, it stays. Friction arms require loosening a knob, repositioning, retightening. You stop adjusting friction arms after week two because it's annoying. Gas-spring arms you actually use. The daily ergonomic benefit of a monitor arm depends entirely on whether you actually adjust it -- so mechanism quality directly determines the value you get.",
  },
  {
    q: "My monitor arm keeps drooping -- is it broken?",
    a: "Check the tension adjustment. Most arms (including HUANUO) have a tension screw or dial on the arm's lower joint or vertical post. Tighten it clockwise. If the arm continues to droop after maximum tension, the arm's weight capacity may be too low for your monitor -- check the rated weight vs. your monitor's actual weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I really need a footrest if my feet touch the floor?",
    a: "If your feet rest flat comfortably while your arms are at 90 for typing, no. But \"feet touching the floor\" and \"feet resting properly\" are different -- many people touch the floor but have knees above 90 or feet slightly forward, which still strains the lower back. Test: sit at your desk in your typing position and check if your knees and hips are at roughly 90. If not, a footrest will help.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will an ergonomic keyboard actually reduce wrist pain?",
    a: "For most people, yes -- with a realistic timeline. Ergonomic keyboards don't cure existing injury; they prevent cumulative strain from continuing to build. Most users report a noticeable reduction in end-of-day wrist tension within 1-2 weeks of switching. If you have sharp or persistent wrist pain already, consult a doctor before relying on a keyboard upgrade as the only intervention.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mount a monitor arm on an IKEA LINNMON desk?",
    a: "Yes -- LINNMON is one of the most common arm-mount surfaces. Use the C-clamp mount, not the grommet option. LINNMON's hollow tabletop structure isn't ideal for grommet drilling. The C-clamp on the edge is the standard approach and works reliably. Confirmed by thousands of Reddit and forum posts from IKEA desk users.",

  {
    q: "Does wireless keyboard/mouse connectivity cause lag for gaming?",
    a: "For productivity use, 2.4G wireless keyboards and mice are effectively indistinguishable from wired at human perception speeds. For competitive gaming (sub-1ms input latency matters), wired or premium gaming wireless is preferable. The Trueque and Wave Keys combos are productivity-grade wireless -- excellent for everything except competitive FPS or rhythm games.",
