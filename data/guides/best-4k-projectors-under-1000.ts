export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Native 4K UHD Resolution at This Tier Means a Genuine Physical Pixel Count, Not Decoded Content",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically state true native 4K UHD resolution (3840x2160 physical pixels), a fundamentally different technology from the 1080P panels with 4K decoding support covered in every lower tier of this series, where the projector's chip physically has four times as many individually addressable pixels rather than downscaling 4K content to a 1080P display. This matters because the actual image sharpness and detail difference between true native 4K and 1080P-with-decoding is genuinely visible on a large screen, especially for content mastered specifically in 4K. Confirm a listing specifically states 'native 4K' or '3840x2160' resolution rather than '4K support' or '4K decoding' language, which indicates the lower-resolution technology covered in this comparison series' earlier tiers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "SGS Color Accuracy Certification With a Delta-E Rating Provides a Specific, Verifiable Professional Standard",
    "explanation": "The XGIMI Elfin Flip 4K pick's SGS-certified color accuracy with a delta-E rating under 1 is a specific, independently verified professional color standard, where delta-E measures the difference between a displayed color and its intended reference color, with under 1 representing an imperceptible difference to the human eye, a considerably more rigorous claim than generic 'vivid colors' marketing language. This matters if color accuracy for professional content creation, photo editing, or color-critical viewing is a genuine priority, less so if you're primarily watching typical entertainment content where minor color variance is less noticeable. Look for a specific delta-E figure or named third-party color certification if professional-grade color accuracy is a priority for your specific use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Native Console Compatibility Claims Like Xbox 1440p at 120Hz Represent Specific Engineering Optimization, Not Just High Refresh Rate",
    "explanation": "The ViewSonic PX749-4K pick's specifically stated native Xbox compatibility with 1440p at 120Hz support indicates the projector's hardware and firmware have been specifically tested and optimized for that console's exact output specifications, a more targeted claim than a general 240Hz refresh rate figure that doesn't confirm specific console compatibility testing. This matters directly if you're a console gamer on a specific platform, where confirmed native compatibility provides more assurance than inferring compatibility from a general high refresh rate spec alone. Check for console-specific compatibility claims naming your exact gaming platform and its specific output resolution and refresh rate before assuming any high-refresh-rate projector automatically delivers optimized performance for your console."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lossless Optical Zoom Differs From Digital Zoom in Preserving Image Quality When Resizing the Projection",
    "explanation": "The XGIMI Elfin Flip 4K pick's lossless 0.98 to 1.3:1 optical zoom physically adjusts the lens elements to change projection size without processing or interpolating the image data, preserving full image quality, unlike digital zoom which crops and upscales the image electronically, introducing pixelation and quality loss as you zoom. This matters if you anticipate needing to adjust screen size for different rooms or seating arrangements, where optical zoom maintains consistent image quality across the zoom range that digital zoom cannot match. Check specifically whether a listing describes 'optical zoom' with a stated ratio versus 'digital zoom' before assuming any 'zoom' feature preserves the same image quality across adjustments."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Short-Throw Variant Availability Addresses Room Layout Constraints That a Standard-Throw-Only Projector Can't Solve",
    "explanation": "The BenQ TK700's availability in both standard throw and short-throw (TK700STi) variants means the same core 4K image quality and features can accommodate rooms with limited depth between the projector's placement point and the screen, a flexibility the single-throw-configuration picks in this comparison don't offer. This matters directly if your intended room layout has limited distance available for standard-throw projection, where a shorter throw distance requirement of 6.5 feet versus 8.2 feet for the same 100 inch image can be the difference between a workable and unworkable installation. Measure your actual available throw distance in your specific room before assuming a standard-throw projector's distance requirements will work for your space, and check for a short-throw variant if your room is more compact."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I tell the difference between native 4K and 1080P-with-4K-decoding on a typical home projection screen size?", "a": "Yes, especially on larger screens above 100 inches or when viewing genuinely 4K-mastered content up close, native 4K resolution shows meaningfully more fine detail and sharper text than a 1080P panel processing the same 4K source, though the difference is less noticeable on smaller screens or at greater viewing distances." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between DLP lamp-based and laser light source projectors at this tier?", "a": "Assuming laser is always the better choice for image quality, when DLP lamp-based projectors like the ViewSonic picks in this comparison deliver higher stated brightness and established gaming performance, making the choice more about your specific priorities (brightness and gaming versus color accuracy and portability) than one technology being universally superior." },
  { "q": "Is the ViewSonic PX749-4K worth it over the cheaper PX701-4K option?", "a": "If you specifically want native Xbox 1440p at 120Hz support with the highest 4000 ANSI lumens brightness for a large theater room, yes, but if genuine native 4K with strong general gaming performance at a lower price matters more, the PX701-4K covers that for about $200 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my room's throw distance works with the BenQ TK700's standard configuration versus needing the short-throw variant?", "a": "Measure the actual distance from your intended projector placement to your screen or wall, and compare it against the standard TK700's 8.2 feet for a 100 inch image versus the TK700STi short-throw variant's 6.5 feet requirement for the same size image." },
  { "q": "Can the XGIMI Elfin Flip 4K's portable design still deliver the same picture quality as the fixed DLP projectors in this comparison?", "a": "Yes, its native 4K UHD resolution and SGS-certified color accuracy match or exceed the color precision of the DLP alternatives, though its stated 1600 ISO lumens brightness is lower than the ViewSonic picks' ANSI lumens figures, making it better suited to darker rooms or evening use." },
  { "q": "Do these true native 4K projectors require a more powerful source device to actually output 4K content?", "a": "Your source device (streaming box, gaming console, or computer) needs to support 4K output for you to see the full benefit of these projectors' native 4K resolution, so confirming your specific streaming devices or consoles output genuine 4K signals is worth checking before assuming automatic 4K playback from any connected source." }
