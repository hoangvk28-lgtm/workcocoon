export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a gaming monitor light bar and a regular monitor light bar?",
    a: "Gaming-focused light bars add features like RGB backlight modes, screen color sync, and ecosystem integration (Razer Chroma, Govee Home) that standard bars lack. Standard bars like the BenQ ScreenBar Classic and Quntis Computer Monitor Lamp focus on task lighting quality - higher CRI, auto-dimming, and glare reduction. Gaming bars trade some lighting efficiency for visual effects. The best choice depends on whether your priority is eye comfort during long sessions or RGB atmosphere.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a monitor light bar reduce eye strain during gaming?",
    a: "Yes, by addressing two main causes of gaming eye strain. First, a bar that prevents glare on the screen reduces the constant eye adjustment between bright reflections and screen content. Second, bars with backlight features (BenQ Halo 2, Quntis RGB models) create bias lighting that reduces the contrast between the bright monitor and the darker wall behind it, which is the primary cause of eye fatigue in dark gaming rooms.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can monitor light bars be used with ultrawide gaming monitors?",
    a: "Yes, but bar length matters. The standard 15.7-inch Quntis and BenQ ScreenBar Classic cover up to 27-inch monitors well. For ultrawide monitors (34 inches and above), the 20-inch Quntis PRO+ and Quntis RGB Pro+ provide better coverage. For curved ultrawides, the Quntis Curved RGB and BenQ ScreenBar Pro with curved compatibility (1000R-1800R) are designed specifically for this use case.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does screen color sync mean on a gaming light bar?",
    a: "Screen color sync means the bar samples the colors being displayed on the monitor and adjusts its backlight LEDs to match. The Govee G1 does this in real time, so if a game displays a red explosion, the rear LEDs shift to red, extending the visual effect beyond the screen edges. This is primarily an ambient effect and does not affect front desk illumination.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the BenQ ScreenBar Halo 2 worth $199 for gaming?",
    a: "It depends on your setup. The Halo 2's main advantage over the $139 ScreenBar Pro is the rear bias lighting, which meaningfully reduces eye strain in consistently dark gaming environments. If you game primarily in a dark room, the bias lighting benefit is real and the price difference is justified. If your room has ambient lighting from windows or overhead lights, the backlight effect is less noticeable and the ScreenBar Pro at $139 provides comparable front illumination.",
