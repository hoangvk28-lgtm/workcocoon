  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",

    q: "What's the best printer for a specific college major?",
    a: "It depends on what your major actually requires. Art and design students benefit from a color inkjet like the Canon PIXMA TS4320, law and business students save money over a semester with a monochrome laser like the Brother HL-L2405W, and STEM students who scan multi-page problem sets do better with an auto document feeder like the Canon PIXMA TR4720.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should a college student expect to spend on printing per semester?",
    a: "A typical student prints roughly 200-400 pages per semester. At that volume, a monochrome laser printer's lower cost-per-page usually beats an inkjet's total ink cost, while a lighter print load may not justify a laser printer's higher upfront price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a printer work with a school-issued Chromebook?",
    a: "Only if it supports mobile or cloud-based printing rather than relying on a traditional installed driver, since Chromebooks generally can't install standard printer drivers.

    q: "Is a laser printer or inkjet better for college students?",
    a: "A monochrome laser like the Brother HL-L2405W is the better value for students printing large volumes of black-and-white text, like law or business coursework, since toner costs less per page and doesn't dry out over breaks. A color inkjet like the Canon PIXMA TS4320 is the better fit for students who genuinely need color output for design or presentation work.",

  {
    q: "Do I need a printer with a document feeder for scanning assignments?",
    a: "Only if your coursework regularly requires scanning multi-page handwritten work or signed multi-page documents. For occasional single-page scans, a basic flatbed scanner like the one on the Canon PIXMA TS3720 is enough, but frequent multi-page scanning is much faster with the Canon PIXMA TR4720's auto document feeder.",

  {
    q: "Is it cheaper to print at the library or buy my own printer?",
    a: "For light printing needs, campus library or lab printing fees per semester can come out cheaper than buying a printer plus ink over a full college stay. For students who print regularly or plan to share the cost with roommates or a project group, owning a printer usually works out cheaper over time.",
