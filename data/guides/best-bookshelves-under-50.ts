export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Per-Shelf Weight Capacity Matters More Than a Vague Total Figure Alone",
    "explanation": "Some listings state only a total weight capacity across the whole unit, while others, like the Furinno Jaya pick in this comparison, specify both per-shelf and total capacity, including a higher rating for the bottom shelf where people naturally place their heaviest items. A per-shelf figure lets you plan exactly what goes where, rather than guessing how weight should distribute across the whole unit to stay within a single total limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Back Panel Prevents a Genuinely Common Annoyance With Open-Frame Shelving",
    "explanation": "Without a back panel, thin items like papers or small decor can slip through the back of an open bookshelf and fall behind it, often into a gap against the wall that's awkward to reach. The Furinno Fulda pick's featured back panel specifically addresses this by giving items a solid surface to rest against, a small but genuinely practical detail worth checking for if you plan to store anything besides sturdy, upright books."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Anti-Tip Kit Installation Method Affects Both Setup Time and Security Level",
    "explanation": "Most anti-tip kits at this price use a simple strap or bracket that attaches to the wall with basic hardware, but the Sweetcrispy pick's topmost iron bracket requires actually drilling into the wall, a more involved installation than a simple strap but generally providing a more secure, permanent connection. If you're in a rental and can't drill into walls, prioritize a pick using a simpler strap-based anti-tip system instead."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Removable Drawer Serves a Different Storage Purpose Than Open Shelving",
    "explanation": "The Furologee pick's removable fabric drawer specifically hides smaller items from view, like chargers, remotes, or craft supplies, that you'd rather not display openly alongside your books, a genuinely different function than the exposed shelving on the other picks in this comparison. If you have a mix of items you want both displayed and hidden, a bookshelf with at least one enclosed drawer serves both needs in a single piece of furniture."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joint Construction Method Affects Long-Term Stability More Than Material Alone",
    "explanation": "The Sweetcrispy pick's mortise-and-tenon H-shape joint construction, combined with triangular corner reinforcements, represents a more deliberate structural engineering approach than simple screw-and-bracket assembly common on cheaper bookshelves. Over years of loading and unloading books, a more robust joint method helps prevent the gradual loosening and wobbling that can develop in a more basic construction, worth prioritizing if you plan to keep the bookshelf long-term."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I place a TV or heavy electronics on top of these bookshelves instead of books?", "a": "Check the specific top-surface weight rating in each listing; the Furinno Jaya pick states its lowest shelf supports up to 35 lbs, but the top surface capacity may differ, so confirm this specific figure before placing anything unusually heavy on top." },
  { "q": "Do I need to install the anti-tip kit, or is it optional?", "a": "While technically optional for basic function, installing the anti-tip kit is strongly recommended for safety, particularly in households with children or pets, since a fully loaded bookshelf can become top-heavy and prone to tipping without this stabilization." },
  { "q": "Is the Furinno Fulda's 3-tier design actually big enough for a meaningful book collection?", "a": "For a modest collection or a specific narrow space application like an entryway or hallway corner, yes, but if you have an extensive book collection, the wider 5-tier picks in this comparison offer meaningfully more storage capacity." },
  { "q": "How long does assembly typically take for these budget bookshelves?", "a": "Most picks in this comparison include clear instructions and labeled parts, with assembly typically taking 20-45 minutes for one person, depending on the specific model's tier count and complexity." },
  { "q": "Can the Furologee's fabric drawer get damaged from regular use?", "a": "The fabric surface is generally durable for typical household items like small electronics or craft supplies, though it's less resistant to sharp or abrasive objects than a solid wood drawer front, so use reasonable care with what you store inside." },
  { "q": "Which pick is most stable if I have young kids or pets who might bump into it?", "a": "The Sweetcrispy pick's reinforced corner brackets and wall-mounted anti-tip bracket provide the most robust stability in this comparison, making it the safer choice specifically for households with active children or pets." }
