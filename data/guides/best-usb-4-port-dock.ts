export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Thunderbolt Bandwidth Is Shared Across All Connected Devices, Not Multiplied by the Number of Ports",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit E5's overall 80Gb/s performance gets dynamically reallocated up to 120Gb/s toward displays specifically when high-refresh monitors are connected via its Bandwidth Boost feature, illustrating that a dock's total bandwidth is a shared pool that shifts based on what's actually plugged in, not four independent full-speed lanes that simply add together. This matters if you're connecting multiple bandwidth-intensive devices simultaneously (an SSD, a high-refresh display, and more), where the actual available bandwidth per device decreases as you add more demanding peripherals, and matters less if you typically only use one or two ports at a time. Understand that a dock's headline bandwidth figure represents a shared total, not a guaranteed full-speed allocation to every single port simultaneously, before assuming four ports means four times the total available bandwidth."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sustained Power Delivery Across Multiple Simultaneous Devices Differs From Peak Power to a Single Device",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit E5 specifically states its 180W power supply provides sustained power delivery to all 9 connected devices simultaneously with no slow drain or loss of charge, a more robust design than a dock that only guarantees its headline wattage figure to a single primary connection. This matters if you regularly charge multiple devices (laptop, phone, tablet) through the same dock at once, where under-provisioned sustained power could cause slower charging or drain across devices, and matters less if you only use the dock's charging capability for one device at a time. Check whether a dock's power delivery is specifically stated as sustained across all connected devices simultaneously, or only guaranteed for a single primary connection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Thermal Behavior Under Full Load Is Worth Checking, Especially for Compact Travel Designs",
    "explanation": "The Amazon Basics pick specifically discloses that the dock may reach 122F/50C when fully loaded, described by the manufacturer as normal operating behavior, a transparent thermal disclosure that matters more for a compact travel-friendly design with less surface area for heat dissipation than larger desk-anchored hubs. This matters if you plan to run the dock at maximum load for extended periods in a warm environment, and matters less for lighter, intermittent use where heat buildup rarely becomes noticeable. Check whether a compact dock discloses its expected operating temperature under full load, particularly if you intend to use it in a hot environment or for sustained heavy workloads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Compatibility Exclusions for Specific Older Chips or Operating Systems Are Real and Worth Checking Individually",
    "explanation": "The Amazon Basics pick specifically excludes M1/M2 chip MacBooks and Chrome OS/Linux laptops, while the UGREEN pick specifically excludes the 2018 Intel Mac mini, meaning both docks have real, named compatibility gaps despite otherwise broad Thunderbolt/USB4 support claims. This matters directly if you own one of these specifically excluded devices, where the dock simply won't function as advertised regardless of its other strengths, and matters less if your device isn't on either exclusion list. Check a dock's specific stated compatibility exclusions against your exact device model and chip generation before assuming broad Thunderbolt or USB4 compatibility claims cover every device unconditionally."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Included Charger Adds Real Value That Should Factor Into Price Comparisons Across Docks",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN pick specifically includes a bundled 140W GaN charger delivering up to 85W to your laptop, meaning you don't need to source and purchase a separate compatible power adapter, while a dock without an included charger requires that additional purchase to actually use its full charging capability. This matters when comparing total cost across docks at different price points, since a cheaper dock without an included charger might end up costing more overall once you add a separately purchased adapter, and matters less if you already own a compatible high-wattage charger. Check whether a dock's listed price includes a compatible power adapter before comparing prices as if every dock represented an equally complete out-of-box solution."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I connect 4 Thunderbolt SSDs to the CalDigit E5 and get full speed on all of them simultaneously?", "a": "You can connect 4 SSDs simultaneously, but since Thunderbolt bandwidth is shared across the dock's total capacity rather than being independently allocated per port, running all 4 at their absolute maximum speed simultaneously may see some bandwidth sharing depending on your host system's own capabilities." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 4-port USB4 or Thunderbolt dock?", "a": "Assuming 4 ports means 4 times the bandwidth of a single-port connection, when Thunderbolt and USB4 bandwidth is actually a shared total pool that gets dynamically allocated based on which devices are connected and what they demand." },
  { "q": "Is the CalDigit E5 worth the extra cost over the OWC 5-port hub if I only need basic Thunderbolt expansion?", "a": "If you only need straightforward Thunderbolt port expansion without networking or card readers, the OWC hub's simpler design and lower price cover that well, but if you want the highest bandwidth, sustained multi-device power, and offline charging, the CalDigit E5's extra cost is justified." },
  { "q": "Will the Amazon Basics dock work with my M1 MacBook Pro?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states this dock is not compatible with M1/M2 chip MacBooks, so M1 or M2 Mac owners should choose a different pick from this comparison, such as the CalDigit E5 or UGREEN pick." },
  { "q": "How do I avoid the resolution downgrade issue mentioned in the Amazon Basics dock's setup instructions?", "a": "The manufacturer specifically recommends connecting your Thunderbolt 4 or USB-C monitor connection before the HDMI port, since connecting HDMI first can trigger a bandwidth allocation that downgrades the resolution of subsequently connected displays." },
  { "q": "Do these 4-port docks require a separate power adapter, or is one included?", "a": "This varies by pick: the UGREEN dock specifically includes a bundled 140W GaN charger, while checking each other specific listing's included accessories is worth doing, since not every dock in this comparison includes a power adapter in the box." }
