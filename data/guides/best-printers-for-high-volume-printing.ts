    "explanation": "Listings for a printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",

    q: "What's the difference between duty cycle and recommended monthly volume?",
    a: "Duty cycle is the maximum technical capacity a printer is rated for, essentially a ceiling, not a healthy sustained pace. Recommended monthly volume is typically a fraction of that figure and represents the range a printer can handle long-term without accelerated wear. Buy based on recommended volume, not the duty cycle number on the spec sheet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a mono laser or a color laser better for high-volume printing?",
    a: "It depends on your actual color needs. A mono laser like the Brother DCP-L2640DW offers the lowest cost per page for black-and-white text but has no color output. A color laser like the HL-L3220CDW or Canon MF753Cdw II costs more per page, four toners instead of one, but makes sense if regular color documents, not just occasional color pages, are part of your real volume.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is the HP OfficeJet Pro 8125 in a high-volume printer list if it uses standard cartridges?",
    a: "It's included as a budget entry point for someone stepping up from occasional to moderate-high volume, not as a match for the laser or ink-tank picks on cost per page. At true sustained high volume, its cartridge costs will run higher than the other printers in this list, so it fits best as a stepping stone rather than an endpoint.",
  },
  {
    q: "What maintenance costs come up beyond ink or toner at high volume?",
    a: "For laser printers, pickup rollers commonly need replacement around every 50,000 pages, and drum units may need periodic replacement depending on the model. For ink-tank printers, the printhead is usually integrated rather than separately replaceable, so periodic nozzle checks matter even at high volume.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a printer overheat during a long print job?",
    a: "Yes, this is called thermal pausing, and budget laser printers handle it worse than higher-tier machines. If you regularly print long, uninterrupted jobs, a more capable machine like the Canon imageCLASS MF753Cdw II is better suited than an entry-level laser.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does paper quality actually matter for a high-volume printer's lifespan?",
    a: "Yes. Cheap copier paper generates more dust and causes more drum wear over time than quality paper, a connection that's easy to overlook when shopping on price per ream. At high volume, using quality paper is part of protecting the printer, not just improving print appearance.",
