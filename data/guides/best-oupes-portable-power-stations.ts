    description: "A massive 1400W AC input delivers a genuine 0-100% recharge in 46 minutes, among the fastest full charges documented at this capacity. The rated 2000W output with 4500W surge capacity handles a stated 99% of high-power appliances including hair dryers and power tools through pure sine wave delivery.\n\nDual 140W PD USB-C ports charge laptops at maximum speed without bulky adapters, and under-20ms UPS switchover protects CPAP machines and routers. Up to 800W solar input via Anderson port reaches full recharge in as fast as 70 minutes with three 240W panels, and at 26.7 lbs, this stays genuinely trunk-portable despite the 1024Wh capacity.",

Direct connection to standard transfer switches or inlet boxes turns this into whole-house backup in seconds, no electrician required.\n\nCombined 240V AC and solar input reaches a full recharge from empty in just 64 minutes, documented 5x faster than comparable stations. Expandable from 4608Wh to 41,472Wh with optional battery packs, and 3600W solar input capacity across a wide 12-175V range genuinely suits remote cabins and mobile living.

  },
  {
    "q": "Does buying oupes guarantee the same battery chemistry across every model?",
    "a": "No. A brand's lineup can span different battery chemistries and generations, so verify the exact model's documented chemistry and cycle-life rather than assuming brand consistency."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?",
    "a": "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a surge or peak wattage rating mean the station can run appliances at that power level?",
    "a": "No. Surge or peak ratings describe a brief burst the inverter can handle, typically for a compressor or motor startup, not a sustained output level. Always check the continuous or rated wattage figure for what the station can actually run for extended periods."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety."
