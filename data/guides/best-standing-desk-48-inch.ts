  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best 48 inch standing desks in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best 48 inch standing desks in 2026 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best 48 inch standing desks in 2026 over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best 48 inch standing desks in 2026 you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is a 48-inch standing desk big enough for a home office?", a: "A 48-inch desk fits a single monitor or laptop plus keyboard and mouse comfortably. For a single 27-inch or 32-inch monitor, a 48-inch desk provides adequate room on both sides. For two 24-inch monitors, the fit is tight and a monitor arm is recommended. For two 27-inch monitors, a 55-inch or wider desk is a better choice. A 48-inch desk is ideal for a single-monitor home office or a laptop-focused setup." },
  { q: "What is the best 48-inch standing desk under $200?", a: "The ErGear 48x24 at $99.99 and the FLEXISPOT EN1 48-inch at $104 to $140 (depending on color) are the best 48-inch desks under $200. The ErGear reaches slightly higher (48.4 vs 46.5 inches). The FLEXISPOT offers a 5-year frame warranty, no center seam, and FLEXISPOT brand reliability. If warranty matters, choose the FLEXISPOT. If max height matters, choose the ErGear." },
  { q: "Can a 48-inch desk hold two monitors?", a: "Two 24-inch monitors fit on a 48-inch desk side by side, but with minimal clearance. A monitor arm is strongly recommended, as it holds both screens further from the front edge and frees desk space for a keyboard pad. Two 27-inch monitors (54 to 58 inches total with bezels) do not fit side by side on a 48-inch desk without overlapping. For two 27-inch screens, choose a 55-inch or wider desk." },
  { q: "Why are 48-inch standing desks cheaper than 55-inch ones?", a: "The primary cost factor in a standing desk is the frame (motor, legs, crossbar), not the desktop. A 55-inch desktop uses about 15% more material than a 48-inch desktop. The frame cost is nearly identical regardless of desktop width. Most manufacturers price the 48-inch configuration $20 to $40 less than the 55-inch equivalent because the desktop material cost is lower, not because the build quality differs." },
  { q: "Does a 48-inch standing desk fit in small apartments?", a: "A 48x24 inch desk occupies 48 inches (4 feet) of wall space and 24 inches (2 feet) of floor depth. In a bedroom or studio apartment, this is a manageable footprint. It fits along most bedroom walls and leaves room for a chair. The compact footprint is one of the main reasons users choose 48-inch desks over wider alternatives for small-space setups." },
