export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Budget Docks Often Require Thunderbolt or Full-Function USB-C, Not Just Any USB-C Port",
    "explanation": "The MOKiN pick's listing specifically states compatibility requires a laptop with Thunderbolt 3/4 or a full-functional USB-C port, a real requirement that many budget or older laptops with data-and-charging-only USB-C ports simply don't meet, regardless of how affordable the dock itself is. This matters significantly if you're not certain your laptop's USB-C port supports video output, where purchasing any of these docks without confirming this first risks a non-functional display connection, and matters less if you've already verified your laptop has full-featured USB-C or Thunderbolt. Check your specific laptop's exact USB-C port specifications for confirmed DisplayPort Alt Mode or Thunderbolt support before purchasing any of these budget docks, since a physically fitting cable doesn't guarantee video will work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Unusually Detailed Named Compatibility List Is More Trustworthy Than a Vague Universal Claim",
    "explanation": "The 14-in-1 multiport pick's listing specifically names over a dozen exact laptop models across Dell, HP, and Lenovo, including specific ThinkPad and Latitude generations, a genuinely more useful and verifiable compatibility disclosure than a generic 'works with all USB-C laptops' claim that doesn't specify which exact models were actually tested. This matters if you own one of these exact named models, where confirmed compatibility gives real assurance, and matters less if your laptop isn't on the list, where compatibility becomes an educated guess rather than a confirmed fact. Look for a dock's specifically named list of confirmed compatible laptop models rather than accepting vague 'universal compatibility' language at face value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Missing Power Adapter Is a Real Additional Cost That Should Factor Into Budget Comparisons",
    "explanation": "The MOKiN pick's listing specifically discloses that the package contains only the product, user manual, and two cables, with the charger not included, meaning the dock's low sticker price doesn't reflect the true total cost if you don't already own a compatible 100W USB-C power adapter. This matters when comparing prices across budget docks, where a slightly pricier dock that includes a power adapter (like the Anker Nano) might actually cost less in total than a cheaper dock plus a separately purchased adapter, and matters less if you already own a suitable charger. Factor in the cost of a separately purchased power adapter when comparing a budget dock's sticker price against a pricier dock that includes one in the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VGA Support Extends Compatibility to Legacy Displays and Older Projectors That Modern Docks Skip",
    "explanation": "The 11-in-1 USB C Hub's inclusion of a 1080p VGA port is a genuinely distinct feature among these four picks, letting you connect to older monitors, TVs, or projectors that only accept VGA input, a connector type increasingly rare on newer, more expensive docks that focus exclusively on HDMI and DisplayPort. This matters if you regularly need to connect to older display hardware, particularly in older classrooms, conference rooms, or home setups with legacy monitors, and matters less if all your displays are modern HDMI or DisplayPort equipped. Check specifically for VGA port inclusion if legacy display compatibility is a real requirement for your specific setup, since most modern docks in this price range have dropped VGA support entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirmed Gaming Handheld and Console Compatibility Is a Genuine, Distinct Selling Point Worth Checking For",
    "explanation": "The 11-in-1 USB C Hub specifically confirms compatibility with the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and other gaming consoles, a genuinely useful disclosure if you're shopping for a dock to use with a handheld gaming device rather than a traditional laptop, since not every budget dock explicitly tests or confirms this compatibility. This matters if you specifically want to dock a gaming handheld to a TV or monitor, and matters less if you're exclusively using the dock with a traditional laptop. Check whether a budget dock specifically confirms compatibility with your exact gaming handheld or console model if that's your primary intended use case, rather than assuming any USB-C dock will work identically well for gaming devices."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will these budget docks work with any laptop that has a USB-C port?", "a": "Not necessarily; several of these picks specifically require your laptop's USB-C port to support Thunderbolt 3/4 or full-function DisplayPort Alt Mode, so confirming your exact laptop's USB-C port capabilities before purchase is essential to avoid a non-functional display connection." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a budget USB4 dock?", "a": "Assuming any budget dock's low price makes it a great deal without checking whether a separate power adapter is required and not included, which can add a meaningful hidden cost that changes the actual value comparison between similarly priced options." },
  { "q": "Is the Anker Nano worth the significant price premium over the cheaper picks for basic use?", "a": "If you only need basic dual-display docking without traveling, the cheaper MOKiN or 14-in-1 picks deliver similar core functionality for much less, but if you want a detachable travel hub plus a complete included package, the Anker Nano's premium reflects that added convenience and completeness." },
  { "q": "Can I use the 11-in-1 USB C Hub with my Steam Deck?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically confirms compatibility with Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Nintendo Switch, and other gaming consoles, making it a genuinely suitable budget option for docking a gaming handheld to a TV or monitor." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my Dell or HP laptop is compatible with the 14-in-1 docking station?", "a": "Check the listing's specifically named compatible model list, which includes exact Dell Latitude, Inspiron, Vostro, and XPS models, plus HP EliteBook, Zbook, and ProBook lines, against your exact laptop model before purchase." },
  { "q": "Do any of these budget docks include the power adapter needed for full charging speed?", "a": "The Anker Nano specifically includes a 140W power adapter in its complete package, while the MOKiN, 14-in-1, and 11-in-1 picks all specifically note the charger is not included, requiring a separate purchase to achieve their stated maximum charging wattage." }
