export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 16:10 Aspect Ratio Shows More Content Than Standard 16:9, Not Just a Bigger Number",
    "explanation": "Aspect ratio describes the shape of the screen, with 16:9 being the widescreen standard used in most laptops and monitors, while 16:10 is proportionally taller for the same width. This matters concretely because a taller screen shows more rows of a spreadsheet, more lines of code, or more of a long document at once without scrolling, a real productivity difference for detail-heavy work. Check the listing's stated resolution numbers directly, like 1920x1200 for 16:10 versus 1920x1080 for 16:9, rather than assuming a bigger diagonal screen size automatically means a taller ratio."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "CNC-Machined Aluminum Isn't Just a Marketing Term",
    "explanation": "CNC machining is a precision manufacturing process that cuts aluminum from a solid block rather than stamping or casting it, generally producing a more rigid, precisely fitted chassis with better heat dissipation through features like a hollow-center stand design. This matters for a triple-screen rig specifically because the panels run warm during extended use, and better airflow can mean more stable long-term performance. Look for the listing to specifically name the manufacturing process or describe a cooling-focused design, rather than just using the word \"aluminum\" without further detail, since aluminum shells vary meaningfully in build quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Jump From a Detachable Panel to a Triple-Screen Rig Is a Cost and Complexity Decision, Not Just a Price Tier",
    "explanation": "Moving from a single detachable panel to a two-panel triple-screen setup roughly doubles your total cost within this price band and requires two full-featured USB-C ports instead of one, plus more weight to carry. This is worth deciding deliberately based on whether you actually need three simultaneous views for your workflow, rather than assuming the pricier option is automatically the better choice, since a $110 detachable panel serves plenty of use cases just as well as a $250 triple-screen rig."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Higher Resolution at the Same Screen Size Means Smaller Text Unless You Scale It",
    "explanation": "A 1200P panel packs more pixels into roughly the same physical screen size as a 1080P panel, which sharpens text and images but also makes on-screen elements physically smaller unless you adjust your operating system's display scaling settings. First-time buyers sometimes expect a higher resolution number to simply mean a bigger, clearer picture without realizing they may need to adjust scaling afterward to keep text a comfortable reading size, so plan to check your OS display settings after connecting a 1200P extender."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check Whether the Premium Price Buys a New Capability or Just a Nicer Finish",
    "explanation": "Within this $110-250 range, some of the price difference between products buys a genuinely new capability, like moving from a single screen to a triple-screen setup, or from 1080P to 1200P resolution, while other differences are closer to finish and branding. Before paying a premium, identify specifically which capability the higher price unlocks for your own use case, since a nicer-looking aluminum finish alone isn't worth the same premium as a real resolution or screen-count upgrade if it doesn't change how you'll actually use the product."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the extra vertical space from a 16:10 panel actually noticeable in daily use?", "a": "Yes, for spreadsheet, coding, or document work specifically, the extra vertical pixels of a 16:10 panel like the S12's 1920x1200 resolution let you see more rows or lines without scrolling, a difference most users notice within the first day of use. For video or general browsing, the difference is less significant." },
  { "q": "Do I need to adjust display scaling after connecting a 1200P extender?", "a": "Possibly, since higher resolution at a similar screen size can make text and icons appear smaller by default. Check your operating system's display settings after connecting and adjust the scaling percentage until text is a comfortable reading size, this typically takes under a minute." },
  { "q": "Is the S12's 1200P triple-screen pick worth $60 more than the standard 1080P ZUMWALT pick?", "a": "If your work involves spreadsheets, code, or long documents where extra vertical space genuinely helps, yes. If you mainly use the extra screens for video calls, browsing, or reference material, the standard 1080P ZUMWALT pick delivers the same core triple-screen benefit for less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my laptop's aluminum triple-screen extender needs extra cooling consideration?", "a": "Check the listing for specific cooling-related design features like a hollow-center stand or ventilation description, generally mentioned directly in the product's feature bullets. If extended heavy use is a concern, a listing describing a specific thermal design, like the S12's hollow-center stand, is a stronger signal than a generic \"premium aluminum\" claim alone." },
  { "q": "Can I upgrade from a detachable single-panel extender to a triple-screen setup later?", "a": "Not directly, since triple-screen kits are sold and mounted as a matched pair with their own specific hardware, and a standalone detachable panel from a different product generally won't integrate with a triple-screen mounting system. If you anticipate needing three screens eventually, it's more practical to buy a dedicated triple-screen kit from the start." },
  { "q": "Does a CNC-machined aluminum build actually make the extender more durable day to day?", "a": "Generally yes, a CNC-machined chassis tends to have tighter tolerances and more rigidity than a stamped or cast aluminum shell, which can translate to less flex and creak over months of folding, unfolding, and transport. That said, both approaches use the same base material, so the practical durability difference is moderate rather than dramatic." }
