  {
    question: "Does wireless charging work through a wooden desk?",
    answer: "Yes -- wireless charging (Qi and Qi2) works through wood up to approximately 30 mm thick. This is the basis of under-desk wireless charging pads that charge through the desk surface from below. For standard desk tops (18--25 mm), it works reliably.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Qi2 better than MagSafe?",
    answer: "For iPhone users, Qi2 and MagSafe deliver identical speed: 15W with magnetic alignment. The practical difference is compatibility: MagSafe works on iPhones only, while Qi2 works on any Qi2-certified device including Android phones (Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Google Pixel 9 series, and others). For a desk used by multiple people with different phones, Qi2 is the better standard.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I charge an Android phone on a MagSafe charger?",
    answer: "A MagSafe charger will charge most Android phones at standard Qi speeds (5--10W) -- but the magnets will not align with an Android phone's back, so manual centering is required. For full Qi2 15W speed on an Android phone, the phone itself needs to be Qi2-certified.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast does wireless charging charge at a desk?",
    answer: "Qi2 / MagSafe at 15W charges an iPhone 15 Pro from 0 to 100% in approximately 90 minutes. Qi at 10W takes approximately 2 hours. For a device charging passively during a workday (sitting on the pad 4--6 hours), both standards get to 100%.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is my wireless charger charging slowly?",
    answer: "Common reasons in a desk context: phone case is too thick or contains metal, phone is off-center on a non-Qi2 pad, the charger's adapter is underpowered (use the included or a certified adapter), or thermal throttling from heat (direct sunlight or a lamp nearby). Qi2 with magnetic alignment eliminates the off-center problem.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the smallest wireless charging station for a desk?",
    answer: "The Anker MagGo Qi2 Pad at ~10 cm diameter. For a 3-in-1 station (phone + watch + buds), the LISEN Qi2 and Anker MagSafe 3-in-1 both have base footprints around 10 x 8 cm -- roughly the size of a large smartphone.",
