    q: "What should I put on a small desk?",
    a: "Prioritize accessories that serve double duty: a monitor riser with built-in storage, a desk mat that also functions as a mouse pad, a cable tray that also holds a power strip. Avoid single-purpose decorative items on desks under 48 inches. Vertical and under-desk accessories earn their place; surface-level items need to justify their footprint.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I make a small desk look bigger?",
    a: "Three quick visual upgrades: (1) hide cables with an under-desk cable tray or cable box, (2) lift the monitor with a riser to clear usable desk space underneath, (3) add a desk mat to visually unify the surface. The desk looks larger because the eye sees less clutter and more intentional organization.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are desk accessories worth it for small spaces?",
    a: "The right ones, yes - especially monitor risers, cable management, and desk mats. These pay back their footprint immediately by adding vertical or under-desk storage or by hiding visual clutter. Skip purely decorative items unless your desk is over 48 inches wide and has room to spare.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the best desk accessories for a dorm room?",
    a: "For a dorm desk (typically 40 to 48 inches wide): a bamboo monitor riser with drawer, an under-desk cable tray, a compact desk mat, and a magnetic phone mount. These cover storage, cables, ergonomics, and tech without overwhelming the limited surface area or requiring any permanent installation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I spend on small desk accessories?",
    a: "Most people are well served by an $80 to $120 total budget covering 4 to 5 accessories. Spending more tends to mean buying accessories that overlap in function or take footprint you do not have. The $40 monitor riser with drawer and the $28 cable tray alone cover most small desk problems.",
  },
  {
    q: "What desk accessories actually save space instead of adding clutter?",
    a: "The footprint-saving accessories are: monitor risers (use vertical space under the screen), under-desk cable trays (use below-desk space), monitor-mounted phone holders (use bezel space), adhesive cable clips (use edge space), and under-desk drawer organizers (use the underside of the desk surface). Anything that sits on the desktop adds to clutter unless it also performs a daily function.",
