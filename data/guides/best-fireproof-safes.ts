export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a fireproof safes genuinely fireproof, or just fire-resistant?",
    "a": "No consumer safe is immune to fire indefinitely; every rated model protects for a specific duration and temperature, after which contents are no longer guaranteed safe. 'Fire-resistant' with a documented rating is the more accurate framing than 'fireproof.'"
  },
  {
    "q": "What should I check before buying a fireproof safes?",
    "a": "Verify the independent fire classification (time and temperature), check usable interior dimensions rather than nominal capacity, and confirm water resistance and physical security as separate facts rather than assuming any one claim covers the others."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does a UL fire classification actually certify?",
    "a": "A UL Classified rating means an independent lab tested that specific model to a defined time-and-temperature standard (commonly 1/2 hour at 1550°F, 1 hour at 1700°F, or 2 hours at 1850°F) and confirmed the interior stayed below a safe threshold for paper documents. It's a model-specific certification, not a general brand claim."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a fireproof safe also protect against water damage?",
    "a": "Not automatically. Fire and water resistance are tested and certified separately, even on the same product, so check both ratings independently rather than assuming a fireproof safe is also waterproof, or vice versa. Many current SentrySafe and Master Lock models document both, but budget safes may only address one."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should a fireproof safe be bolted to the floor or wall?",
    "a": "For anything beyond a small portable chest, yes, if theft deterrence matters to you: an unanchored safe, however heavy, can still be carried off by a determined thief with the right tools and enough time. Most safes over about 1 cubic foot include pre-drilled mounting holes and hardware for this reason."
