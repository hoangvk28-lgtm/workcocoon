The Genmitsu App handles remote control and troubleshooting, and it ships as two pre-assembled modules that cut assembly effort by roughly 80%, with setup claimed at around 10 minutes.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do all 3030 pro max desktop cnc machines machines have the same specs since they share the size-class name?",
    "a": "No. The size-class number describes a rough XY footprint, not a technical standard, so rails, spindle, and controller can differ significantly between models sharing the same class name."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I buy based on the size class or the exact model number?",
    "a": "Always verify the exact model and generation, since manufacturers frequently update hardware while keeping a similar size-class name, meaning two '3018' machines can perform very differently."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
