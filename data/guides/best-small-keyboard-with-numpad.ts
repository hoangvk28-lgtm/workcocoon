  {
    q: "What is a 96% keyboard?",
    a: "A 96% keyboard includes all the keys of a full-size 104-key keyboard including the numpad in a more compact frame. It achieves this by eliminating the gaps between key clusters and slightly tightening the navigation section. The result is a keyboard about 4 to 6 cm narrower than a standard full-size layout while retaining every key including the number pad.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 96% keyboard good for small desks?",
    a: "Yes. A full-size keyboard with numpad typically measures 44 cm wide. A 96% keyboard measures about 38 to 40 cm. That 4 to 6 cm difference is meaningful on a 60 to 80 cm desk. For comparison, a TKL without numpad is about 36 cm, so the trade-off for keeping the numpad in a 96% layout is only about 2 to 4 cm wider than TKL.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I add a numpad to my existing TKL keyboard?",
    a: "Yes. A separate wireless numpad like the Nulea connects via Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz and functions as an independent number pad. You place it to the right of your keyboard when needed and store it when not. This is the most flexible option if you already own a compact keyboard you are happy with.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which compact keyboard with numpad is best for Mac?",
    a: "The Keychron V5 Max and K4 both ship with Mac and Windows keycap sets and are designed for dual-OS use. The Logitech MK470 and Amazon Basics are Windows-optimized. For Mac users, Keychron is the cleaner choice with proper key labeling and Fn mapping.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a numpad and a number row?",
    a: "The number row (keys 1 to 0 across the top of the keyboard) requires the Shift key for symbols and a longer finger reach. The numpad is a dedicated 17-key cluster in a calculator layout allowing fast single-hand numeric entry. For Excel, accounting, invoicing, or any data-heavy work, the numpad is significantly faster for number input than the number row.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a 96% keyboard and a full-size keyboard?",
    a: "A full-size keyboard has 104 keys spread across dedicated clusters with spacing between them, typically about 44 cm wide. A 96% keyboard has the same keys but removes the gaps between clusters, bringing the total width to about 38 to 40 cm. Both have a numpad. The 96% saves about 4 to 6 cm of desk width without losing any keys.",
