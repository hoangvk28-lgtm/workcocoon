  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best walking pad often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best walking pad holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best walking pad over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best walking pad you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best walking pad that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How quiet is a walking pad during a home office work day?", a: "At 1.5 mph, most walking pads operating at 35 to 45dB produce noise comparable to a quiet laptop fan. A rubber mat underneath reduces floor vibration. In a dedicated home-office room with a closed door, the noise level is generally inaudible to others in the house." },
  { q: "Will I be distracted by the walking pad during work?", a: "Most users require 1 to 2 weeks of adaptation before walking at desk speed feels natural during tasks. Email, reading, and phone calls adapt fastest. Complex analysis or writing requiring deep focus may take longer to adapt. Start with 30-minute walking sessions and extend gradually as concentration returns to baseline." },
  { q: "Do I need a standing desk for a walking pad?", a: "Not necessarily. A walking pad works under any desk where you stand to work, including counter-height surfaces or custom-raised platforms. The key is having the keyboard and screen at the correct height for standing ergonomics, not the specific desk type. If your desk cannot be raised, a standing desk converter paired with a walking pad is a common alternative." },
  { q: "Can a walking pad go on carpet?", a: "Yes, though carpet reduces the effective non-slip grip of the pad's rubber feet, which can cause the unit to shift during use. A flat rigid mat placed between the walking pad and carpet prevents movement and protects both the carpet and the pad's underside." },
  { q: "How much space does a walking pad take in a home office?", a: "A standard walking pad in use requires approximately 42 to 50 inches of floor length and 20 to 21 inches of width, roughly the size of a large yoga mat. When folded for storage, most compact models reduce to 4 to 6 inches thick, fitting under desks, beds, or sofas without occupying additional room space." },
