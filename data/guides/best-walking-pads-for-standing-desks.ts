export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best walking pad often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best walking pad holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best walking pad over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best walking pad you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best walking pad that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Can you actually work while using a walking pad?", a: "Yes, but only at walking speeds (0.5 to 3 mph maximum for most people). At these speeds typing accuracy is minimally affected after a brief adaptation period of 15 to 30 minutes. Video calls, reading, and email are compatible. Complex coding or design work requiring fine mouse precision is harder to sustain beyond 30-minute sessions." },
  { q: "How loud are walking pads at desk speed?", a: "Most walking pads at 1 to 2 mph produce noise similar to a quiet fan (35 to 45dB). Brushless motor models (WalkingPad Z1R, P1, UREVO SpaceWalk 5L) run at the quieter end of that range. The UREVO SpaceWalk 5L is rated under 35dB. Standard brushed motors run slightly louder, typically 45 to 55dB at desk speed." },
  { q: "What speed should you walk at a standing desk?", a: "Most productivity research suggests 1.5 to 2 mph as the sweet spot for desk work. Below 1 mph the motion provides minimal calorie benefit. Above 2.5 mph typing accuracy and focus quality begin to decrease for most users. Start at 1 mph for the first week and increase gradually as your body adapts." },
  { q: "Do walking pads damage floors?", a: "Walking pads should not damage floors when used with a mat underneath. Most pads ship with anti-slip rubber feet, but a dedicated treadmill mat (sold separately) provides additional floor protection and reduces vibration transmission. Hardwood floors and tiles are more susceptible to scratching than carpeted surfaces." },
  { q: "How much desk clearance do I need for a walking pad?", a: "The pad itself requires 4 to 6 inches of vertical clearance at the machine level, plus your shoe height (1 to 2 inches) and enough overhead space for comfortable stride. Set your standing desk to the height where your arms rest naturally at a slight downward angle, then verify the pad fits underneath without obstruction from desk legs or crossbars." },
