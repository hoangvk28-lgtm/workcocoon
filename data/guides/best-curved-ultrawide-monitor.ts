    q: "What does the curve radius number, like 1500R or 1800R, mean?",
    a: "It's the radius, in millimeters, of the circle the screen's curve is based on, so a lower number means a tighter, more aggressive curve. In this guide, 1000R would be the tightest possible curve, designed to roughly match the curvature of the human eye at close range, while the 1800R picks here use a gentler curve better suited to farther viewing distances or color-critical editing work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a tighter curve always better on a curved ultrawide?",
    a: "No. A tighter curve like 1500R feels most immersive at typical desk viewing distances, but it can distort straight lines near the edges more than a gentler 1800R curve, which matters if you do photo or video editing where straight-line accuracy counts. Match the curve to your primary use case, not just to whichever number sounds more premium.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the 49-inch pick in this guide use a gentler 1800R curve instead of a tighter one?",
    a: "The Samsung Odyssey G93SC 49\" wraps an 1800R curve around considerably more screen width than the 34-inch picks in this guide, and a tighter radius at that width would place the far edges at an impractical viewing angle. Larger curved screens generally pair better with a gentler curve, not a tighter one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose VA or FastIPS for a curved monitor?",
    a: "VA panels like the SANSUI and Alienware AW3425DWM in this guide deliver deeper native contrast, while the ASUS FastIPS pick trades some of that contrast for far more consistent color at wide viewing angles. If you regularly view the screen off-center or do color-sensitive editing work, FastIPS is the better tradeoff.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a curved monitor need a special monitor arm?",
    a: "It's worth checking. Curved panels shift the center of gravity forward compared to a flat monitor of the same weight, which can multiply the effective torque on an arm's tilt pivot by roughly 1.5-2x. Confirm any arm you pair with a pick in this guide is rated for that added load, not just the monitor's listed weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which curved monitor in this guide is the best value?",
    a: "The SANSUI is the strongest overall value, combining the lowest price and the largest review base in this guide with a genuinely fast 200Hz refresh rate. If you're ready to spend more for QD-OLED contrast, the Alienware AW3425DW offers the best refresh-rate-to-price ratio among the QD-OLED picks here.",
