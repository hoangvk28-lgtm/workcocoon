  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Can any docking station give my MacBook Air 2 external displays?",
    a: "Not by itself. If you have an M1 or M2 Air, only a DisplayLink dock like the PULWTOP or TobenONE 18-in-2 can add a genuine second display, since the chip itself only supports 1 native external display. An M3 Air supports a second display natively, but only in clamshell mode with the lid closed. The M4 and M5 Air are the first generations to support 2 native displays with the lid open.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a 100W dock if my MacBook Air only charges at 45W?",
    a: "Not strictly, but it helps. A 100W dock gives you headroom to charge an iPad or iPhone through the dock's other ports at the same time without slowing down the Air's own charging. If you're only ever charging the Air itself, a 60-65W rated dock is enough.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my MacBook Air slow down after being docked for a while?",
    a: "The MacBook Air has no fan, so sustained loads like dual 4K DisplayLink output plus a video call can trigger thermal throttling after 20-30 minutes. This is a limitation of the fanless design, not a defect in the dock. If it happens regularly, consider reducing to a single external display during long calls.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a Thunderbolt dock better than a USB-C hub for a MacBook Air?",
    a: "It depends on what you need. A basic USB-C hub uses Alt Mode bandwidth and works fine for a single display and everyday ports. A Thunderbolt-certified dock like the Plugable TBT-UDM uses the full 40Gbps Thunderbolt lane, which matters if you're on an M4/M5 Air wanting native dual displays or a single 6K display, or if you need faster data transfer speeds than a basic hub provides.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I still use my MacBook Air's MagSafe port while docked?",
    a: "Yes, and it's a useful setup. Charging through MagSafe while the dock handles data and display over USB-C frees up both of the Air's USB-C ports for other connections instead of dedicating one to dock power passthrough.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick supports 3 external monitors on a MacBook Air?",
    a: "Only the Anker DL6350 in this list supports a genuine triple-display setup, done entirely through DisplayLink software rendering since no MacBook Air chip generation natively drives 3 displays. Expect noticeably more CPU overhead than a single or dual-display DisplayLink setup.",
