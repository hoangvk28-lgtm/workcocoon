      "As a monochrome laser with duplex printing built in, the DCP-L2640DW uses a sturdier paper path than most inkjets in its price range, and laser engines generally handle a wider range of paper weights without the curling that trips up inkjet rollers. Its 250-sheet capacity tray reduces how often paper gets refilled, which matters since overfilling a tray is one of the most common jam triggers.\n\nLike any printer, it will still jam if fed damp or curled paper, or if the tray is stuffed past its fill line. Keeping paper stored flat and dry and never exceeding the tray's marked capacity does more for reliability here than any spec on the box.\n\nLarge tray reduces refill-related overfilling.

    q: "Why does my printer jam more than it used to?",
    a: "Pickup rollers gradually lose grip through years of normal use, so a 3-year-old printer jamming more often than it did new is expected wear, not necessarily a sign of a defective unit. Many models sell inexpensive replacement roller kits if jam frequency increases noticeably with age.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does humidity actually cause paper jams?",
    a: "Paper absorbs ambient moisture and swells slightly, which changes how sheets separate and feed through rollers. Storing paper in a humid garage, basement, or bathroom-adjacent space, rather than sealed in its ream wrapper in the same climate-controlled room as the printer, measurably increases jam risk.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can mixing paper weights in one tray cause jams?",
    a: "Yes. Feed rollers are calibrated for a single paper weight at a time, so mixing a few sheets of cardstock or photo paper into a stack of standard paper confuses the mechanism and raises misfeed risk. Load one weight per tray and use a rear straight-feed slot for anything heavier if your printer has one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does an automatic document feeder increase jam risk?",
    a: "An ADF adds a jam point if fed stapled pages, torn edges, or a stack exceeding its rated sheet capacity, but a well-designed ADF that separates sheets individually is otherwise a reliable way to scan multi-page originals. Removing staples and straightening damaged corners before scanning reduces this risk significantly.",
