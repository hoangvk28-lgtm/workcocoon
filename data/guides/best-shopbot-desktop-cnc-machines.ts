    description: "Solid machined aluminum construction with pinned and bolted connections, plus fully supported THK linear rails and bearings on every axis, puts this closer to shop-grade construction than typical desktop hobby routers. A dual-drive Y-axis motor setup specifically eliminates gantry flex during hard material cuts that a single central motor would struggle with.\n\nChoose between an aluminum T-slot deck with an MDF spoilboard or a vacuum deck using a Fein Turbo II kit for strong, silent suction on standard 120VAC outlets. ShopBot's proprietary control software pairs with bundled Vectric VCarve Pro (with an Aspire upgrade path), and the whole system runs on a standard wall outlet with lifetime phone support included.",
    specs: ["Dual-drive Y-axis eliminates gantry flex","T-slot or vacuum deck configurations","VCarve Pro included, Aspire upgrade path"],
    pros: ["Dual-drive Y-axis specifically prevents gantry flex on hard cuts","Runs on a standard 120VAC wall outlet, no special power","Lifetime phone support and documentation included"],
    cons: ["Higher price reflects the shop-grade construction","Vacuum deck option requires the separate Fein Turbo II kit"],

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are all shopbot desktop cnc machines products currently sold, or does the lineup include discontinued models?",
    "a": "Check current first-party store pages directly, since older models often stay heavily indexed in search results long after being discontinued or moved to support-only status."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does buying a well-known brand guarantee better build quality?",
    "a": "Not automatically. Brand lineups often span multiple hardware generations and price tiers, so verify the exact model's specs rather than assuming brand reputation alone predicts quality."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
