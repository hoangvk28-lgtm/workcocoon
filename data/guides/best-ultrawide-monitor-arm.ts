export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your desk can actually grip the mounting base before comparing arms",
    "explanation": "A monitor arm's clamp or grommet base needs a solid desk edge to grip securely, and this is the real first question to answer before comparing gas spring tension or weight capacity, since a hollow honeycomb-core desktop, a glass top, or a desk under about an inch thick can rule out an entire category of arms regardless of how good the arm itself is.\n\nThis matters because discovering after purchase that your desk simply can't mount the arm you bought is a common and entirely avoidable problem.\n\nCheck your desk's actual edge thickness and construction (solid, hollow-core, or glass), and confirm the arm's clamp or grommet base is explicitly rated for that construction before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check real per-arm weight capacity, not the bundled-stand weight printed on the monitor box",
    "explanation": "Monitor weight ratings printed on the box often reference the monitor's included stand, not the bare panel weight relevant to a monitor arm, and a monitor arm's real weight capacity needs to match your specific monitor's actual panel weight without its stand, information usually found in the monitor's separate spec sheet rather than the box itself.\n\nThis matters directly for a larger or ultrawide monitor, where the gap between stand-inclusive and bare-panel weight can be substantial enough to matter.\n\nCheck your monitor's bare panel weight (without its stand) in its official spec sheet, and compare that specifically against the arm's rated capacity, not a generalized weight class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify VESA compatibility for both your monitor and the arm's mounting plate",
    "explanation": "VESA mounting patterns come in a few standard sizes (75x75mm and 100x100mm are most common), and a mismatch between your monitor's VESA pattern and the arm's mounting plate means the arm simply won't attach, some arms include an adapter for multiple patterns while others support only one.\n\nThis matters directly for a monitor with a non-standard or larger VESA pattern, particularly some ultrawide or curved monitors, where assuming universal compatibility can lead to an unusable purchase.\n\nCheck your monitor's specific VESA pattern in its spec sheet, and confirm the arm explicitly supports that pattern, either natively or with an included adapter, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand gas spring tension and how it affects long-term reliability",
    "explanation": "A gas spring monitor arm relies on an internal pressurized cylinder to hold the monitor at any height with minimal effort, and tension needs to be roughly matched to your monitor's actual weight, a monitor lighter than the spring's calibrated range can drift upward on its own, while pressure calibrated too low for a heavier monitor won't hold position and will slowly droop.\n\nThis matters for long-term usability, not just initial setup, since gas springs can also lose tension gradually over years of use.\n\nCheck the arm's rated weight range against your monitor's actual weight, favoring a monitor that falls comfortably within the middle of that range rather than at either extreme."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider reach and range of motion against your actual desk depth and seating position",
    "explanation": "An arm's horizontal reach and vertical range of motion determine how far the monitor can extend from the mounting point and how much height adjustment is available, and these dimensions matter differently depending on your desk depth and how far back you sit, a shallow desk needs less reach than a deep one, and a standing desk that changes height throughout the day needs a wider vertical range to stay at eye level.\n\nThis matters more for anyone switching between sitting and standing regularly, less for a fixed single seated position.\n\nCheck the arm's listed reach and height range against your actual desk depth and how much your seated or standing eye level varies throughout the day."

  {
    q: "Can a standard monitor arm hold a 49\" ultrawide?",
    a: "Usually not safely. A standard 24-27\" monitor arm is typically designed for 8-15 lbs, while 49\" ultrawides commonly weigh 25-35+ lbs, and most standard arms also lack the 200x200mm VESA pattern many 49\" monitors need. Look for an arm specifically rated for ultrawide or super-ultrawide use, like the Ergotron HX or HUANUO TitanLift in this list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does a curved ultrawide need a sturdier arm than a flat one of the same weight?",
    a: "A curved panel's shape shifts its center of gravity forward compared to a flat panel of the same weight, which can multiply the effective torque on the arm's tilt pivot by roughly 1.5-2x. That's why an arm can look rated heavy enough on paper and still sag or drift down over time when mounting a curved 1000R or 1800R panel.",

    q: "Do I need 100x100mm or 200x200mm VESA for my ultrawide?",
    a: "34\" ultrawides typically only need 100x100mm VESA, while a true 49\" super-ultrawide often needs 200x200mm. Always check your specific monitor's VESA spec and the arm's compatible range before buying, weight rating and VESA compatibility are two separate specs that both need to match.",

    q: "Is a C-clamp or grommet mount better for an ultrawide arm?",
    a: "A C-clamp works on most standard desk edges and is easier to reposition or remove later, while a grommet mount needs an existing or drillable hole but can feel more permanent and stable for a heavier panel. Every arm in this list except the Secretlab Magnus offers both options, so the choice usually comes down to your desk's edge thickness and whether drilling is an option.",
