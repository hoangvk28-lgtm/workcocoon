    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best walnut standing desks in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best walnut standing desks in 2026 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is a walnut standing desk real wood?", a: "In almost all cases, no. Walnut standing desks available in the $100 to $500 range use walnut-tone laminate over an MDF core. The laminate is a photographic wood-grain layer that resembles solid walnut but is not. Solid walnut standing desk tops exist but cost $800 to $2,000 for the desktop alone, putting them well above the desks in this guide. If you need solid walnut, look at custom desk builders or specialty woodworking stores rather than Amazon." },
  { q: "What is the difference between black walnut and dark walnut finishes?", a: "Black walnut is a near-black deep brown, typically close to charcoal with subtle grain. Dark walnut is a medium-dark espresso brown with more visible grain texture and more brown warmth. In practical terms, black walnut appears darker and more executive, dark walnut appears warmer and closer to traditional wood furniture. Both are laminate finishes. Check the product photos against your room lighting and existing furniture before choosing." },
  { q: "Does walnut laminate scratch easily?", a: "Walnut laminate is similar in scratch resistance to other laminate finishes. Surface scratches from keys, rings, or dragged items are possible but not common under normal desk use. Walnut laminate will not show light scratches as visibly as white laminate because the dark color and grain pattern camouflage minor marks. Heavy dragging of sharp metal objects or abrasive materials can scratch any laminate. A desk mat protects the surface under the keyboard and mouse area." },
  { q: "What color chair goes with a walnut standing desk?", a: "Black and dark gray chairs pair cleanly with black walnut and dark walnut desks. Tan or cognac leather chairs create a classic executive combination with walnut. Natural wood armchairs or woven seat chairs pair with medium-tone special walnut for a more casual aesthetic. White or bright-colored chairs create contrast that highlights the walnut tone but can look mismatched in a traditional setup. The frame color of the desk (usually black) should match or complement the chair base color." },
  { q: "Can I use a walnut standing desk in a bright room?", a: "Yes. Walnut desks in bright rooms with natural light show the grain detail more clearly than in dim lighting, which enhances the premium look. Direct sunlight on the surface for extended periods can cause minor fading of the laminate over several years, similar to any furniture finish. A window covering or UV-blocking window film protects the surface if the desk is in direct sun for most of the day." },
