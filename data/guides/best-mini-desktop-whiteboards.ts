  "This guide covers the smallest tier of desktop whiteboard, the mini category, distinct from our broader small desktop whiteboard guide which covers slightly larger boards suited to short lists. The picks here run from 8x6 inches down to boards explicitly labeled \"mini\" by their own listings, and we compare them by actual dimensions rather than assuming mini and small are interchangeable.",
  "At this size, realistic use shifts from general note-taking toward single-task reminders, since a genuinely mini board doesn't have room for a running list. What you're really buying at this tier is portability and a minimal desk footprint, not writing capacity, worth keeping in mind before comparing prices against larger boards.",
