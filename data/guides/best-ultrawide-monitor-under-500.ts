  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the ultrawide monitor under 500 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this ultrawide monitor under 500 over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any ultrawide monitor under 500 you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A ultrawide monitor under 500 that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "What's the best ultrawide monitor under $500 overall?",
    a: "It depends on use case. The Alienware AW3425DWM has the highest rating in this guide at 4.6 stars with a fast 1ms response time and a dedicated console mode. The Dell S3425DW has the fastest response time overall at 0.03ms, and the LG 34WR55QK-B is the strongest pick specifically for work and productivity.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 1000R or 1500R curve better on a budget ultrawide?",
    a: "A 1000R curve, found on the Samsung Odyssey G5 in this guide, is more aggressive and matches natural eye curvature more closely, giving a more immersive, wrap-around feel. The more common 1500R curve found on most other picks here is gentler and works well for both gaming and desktop productivity.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which ultrawide under $500 has USB-C?",
    a: "Only 2 picks in this guide include USB-C with Power Delivery, the LG 34WR55QK-B and the Dell S3425DW, both at 65W. Every other pick relies on standard HDMI and DisplayPort connections only.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need G-Sync or FreeSync certification?",
    a: "It depends on your GPU brand. The MSI MAG 346CQ is the only pick in this guide certified for both G-Sync Compatible and FreeSync, a safer bet if you might switch GPU brands later. Every other pick here supports FreeSync only.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much desk depth do I need for a 34\" ultrawide?",
    a: "A 34\" ultrawide is comfortable at roughly 24-31 inches of viewing distance. That's closer than the 35-39 inches a 49\" panel needs, but it still takes more desk depth than a standard 27\" monitor, so measure your usable desk depth, front edge to wall, before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick is best for a console and PC on the same screen?",
    a: "The Alienware AW3425DWM is the only pick in this guide with a dedicated console mode, making it the clear choice if you regularly switch between a gaming PC and a console on the same display.",
