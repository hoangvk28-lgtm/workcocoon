    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best wood cable management boxes (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best wood cable management boxes (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best wood cable management boxes (2026) over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Are wood cable management boxes safe for power strips?", a: "Yes. Wood is not inherently a fire hazard when used to enclose a power strip operating at normal load levels. The fire risk with power strips comes from overloading circuits, not from the enclosure material. All major wood cable boxes in this roundup include ventilation holes or slots that allow heat to escape, which is the key safety factor regardless of enclosure material." },
  { q: "What is the difference between bamboo and wood cable boxes?", a: "Bamboo is technically a grass that is processed into boards resembling wood. Bamboo boxes are more moisture-resistant, harder, and more dimensionally stable than most hardwood alternatives. Real wood boxes (mango, acacia, beech) have more natural grain variation and a warmer tone. Bamboo tends to have a lighter, more uniform appearance." },
  { q: "How do I clean a wood cable management box?", a: "Wipe wood cable boxes with a slightly damp cloth and dry immediately. Do not use spray cleaners, water-based solutions, or leave moisture on the surface for extended periods. Bamboo boxes can tolerate slightly more moisture exposure than standard hardwood. For dust removal, a dry microfiber cloth is sufficient for weekly maintenance." },
  { q: "Can I put a wood cable box near a window or in direct sunlight?", a: "Direct sunlight causes wood to fade, dry out, and crack over time. Mango wood and acacia are particularly susceptible to UV-induced color change. Place wood cable boxes away from direct sun or use a UV-filtering window treatment if sun exposure is unavoidable. Bamboo and polypropylene rattan (Cantalop) are more UV-resistant than natural wood alternatives." },
  { q: "What size power strip fits in a wood cable management box?", a: "The Luxe Designs at 15.94 inches accommodates the longest standard power strips. Most standard 6-outlet power strips measure 11 to 13 inches long and fit the LiTY (12 inches), COREMINDED (14.17 inches), and Kos Design bamboo box. The Baskiss limits to 11.4 inches, which excludes some longer strip models. Measure your power strip before ordering." },
