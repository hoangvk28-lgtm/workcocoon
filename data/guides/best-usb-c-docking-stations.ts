  "\"USB-C hub\" and \"USB-C docking station\" get used interchangeably by sellers, but the two aren't quite the same thing. A true docking station includes independent power delivery circuitry and usually adds Ethernet or dual-display support, while a cheaper hub can look similar on the box but only pass through limited power without meaningfully boosting what actually reaches your laptop.",
  "That distinction matters most on a tight budget or a small desk setup, where it's easy to pay extra for a 14-port dock when a $27 hub already covers what a single laptop and monitor actually need.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Is a USB-C hub the same thing as a USB-C docking station?",
    a: "Not exactly, even though sellers use the terms interchangeably. A true docking station includes independent power delivery circuitry and often Ethernet or dual-display support, while a cheaper hub may just pass through ports without meaningfully boosting power delivery. Check the PD wattage spec directly rather than relying on the product name.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why did my laptop battery still drain while plugged into a USB-C hub?",
    a: "This is usually a wattage mismatch. A common budget mistake is buying a hub with a lot of ports but only 60W or less of PD passthrough, which isn't enough for many standard laptop chargers. Match the dock's PD wattage to your laptop's actual charger spec, 65W, 90W, or 100W+, rather than judging by port count.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need Thunderbolt or is USB-C enough for a basic docking station?",
    a: "For everyday dual-monitor and peripheral use, a USB-C hub or dock like the picks in this guide is plenty. Thunderbolt certification matters more if you're connecting Thunderbolt-specific peripherals or need guaranteed bandwidth performance, since USB4/USB-C hardware generally works with Thunderbolt devices but isn't certified the same way.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 100W USB-C dock fully fast-charge my laptop?",
    a: "Usually close, but not exactly 100W in practice. A dock rated for 100W typically delivers about 10-15W less to the laptop once the dock's own circuitry draws its share. For most standard laptops this margin doesn't matter, but workstation laptops needing the full rated wattage under heavy load should look for a dock rated meaningfully above their actual requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which USB-C dock in this guide is cheapest while still covering the basics well?",
    a: "The UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station (Revodok Pro) at $26.96 is the cheapest pick in this guide and still includes dual 4K@60Hz HDMI, 10Gbps data ports, and a genuine 100W PD passthrough, covering the core needs of a basic desk setup without extra cost.",
