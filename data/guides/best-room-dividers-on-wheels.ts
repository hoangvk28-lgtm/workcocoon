  {
    "criterion": "Check freestanding stability against your actual floor type, not just an empty room demo",
    "explanation": "A freestanding divider relies entirely on its own base footprint and panel angle for stability, with no wall support, and how well it actually stays upright varies depending on floor type, a divider that stands solidly on carpet can behave differently on hardwood or tile, and panels catching a draft from an HVAC vent can wobble more than expected.\n\nThis matters because a divider that looks stable in a still product photo can still tip or shift with regular foot traffic brushing past it.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world stability mentions on floor types similar to yours, and check the base footprint width relative to the divider's height, since a taller divider needs a wider base to stay stable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm genuine sound dampening if acoustic privacy is the actual goal, not just visual blocking",
    "explanation": "A room divider marketed as \"acoustic\" should use a real sound-dampening material, typically a felt or fabric-wrapped panel core, that measurably reduces noise transmission, distinct from a simple solid panel or bookcase that only blocks the sightline without doing anything meaningful for sound.\n\nThis distinction matters directly if noise reduction for calls or focused work is your actual goal, since a purely visual divider does very little to dampen adjacent conversation or ambient noise regardless of how solid it looks.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated acoustic material, not just the word \"acoustic\" in the title with no supporting material description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match panel height to your ceiling and the actual privacy level you need",
    "explanation": "Panel height determines both visual privacy and how much of the room's overall openness the divider preserves, a shorter divider maintains more light and airflow but offers less real privacy, while a taller divider that extends closer to the ceiling gives stronger separation at the cost of feeling like a more permanent wall.\n\nThis matters more in a room with a high ceiling, where a standard-height divider can look and feel undersized, and less in a room with a standard 8-foot ceiling where most divider heights work proportionally.\n\nCheck the listed divider height against your room's actual ceiling height and how much visual openness you want to preserve, not just the divider's general size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh assembly and mounting requirements against whether you're renting or own the space",
    "explanation": "Room dividers span a wide range of setup requirements, from a no-drill freestanding panel that requires zero installation to a wall-mounted or track-based divider requiring drilling and potentially professional installation, and which one is appropriate depends heavily on whether you're in a rented space where drilling isn't an option, or a space you own where a more permanent installation is fine.\n\nThis matters directly for a renter, discovering after purchase that a divider requires wall-mounting hardware is a real and avoidable problem in a space where drilling isn't allowed.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for the mounting method, freestanding, no-drill, or requiring wall anchors, before ordering, especially in a rented space."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider mobility needs if the divider will move between rooms or configurations regularly",
    "explanation": "A divider on wheels or casters can be repositioned easily between rooms or reconfigured for different layouts throughout the week, useful for anyone who needs flexible zoning rather than a permanent room split, but wheels also mean the divider is inherently less stable than a fixed-base design and can shift underfoot if bumped.\n\nThis matters more if you genuinely need to move the divider often, like separating a home office from a living space only during work hours, less if it'll stay in one position long-term.\n\nCheck whether casters are lockable to prevent unwanted movement once positioned, and weigh mobility against the reduced stability it typically brings."

    q: "Do all room dividers marketed for small spaces come with wheels?",
    a: "No. Several listings that show up in the same search results as wheeled dividers, including some single-panel screens in this exact product pool, do not have casters at all. Always check the listing title and bullet points for the words wheels, casters, or brakes before assuming a divider rolls.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much weight can the wheels on a room divider actually hold?",
    a: "Small casters on this category of room divider are commonly rated for only 20 to 30 lbs each. A wider, multi-panel or wood-frame divider can weigh more than that per caster once you total the frame weight, so it's worth checking the caster load rating against the panel's total weight rather than assuming it's fine.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of wheels are best for hardwood floors?",
    a: "Rubber casters grip and roll quietly on hardwood or tile without leaving marks, unlike hard nylon or plastic wheels which can be noisy and occasionally scuff softer flooring. If your divider will roll on hardwood regularly, prioritize a confirmed rubber-caster listing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are taller wheeled room dividers less stable?",
    a: "Yes. A 6-foot or taller divider has a higher center of gravity than a shorter panel, making it more prone to tipping while being rolled, especially over an uneven threshold or door track. Move taller wheeled dividers slowly and avoid pushing from the top panel edge.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do some locking casters stop working after a few months?",
    a: "Locking levers made of plastic wear down faster with repeated use than metal-lever locks. If you plan to reposition your divider often, a listing that specifies metal locking hardware will hold up longer than one that doesn't mention the lever material at all.",
