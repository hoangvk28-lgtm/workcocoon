export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Bus-Powered Design Means One Less Cable to Pack, But Usually Trades Away Multi-Display Support",
    "explanation": "The Satechi Pro Hub Mini draws power entirely through its USB4 connection with no separate adapter required, while the EDiMAX pick includes its own 100W power adapter to unlock support for up to triple displays, a genuine tradeoff between minimizing what you pack and maximizing display flexibility at your destination. This matters if minimizing travel bulk is your top priority, where a bus-powered hub is the lighter choice, and matters less if you regularly need to drive multiple external monitors when traveling for work. Check whether a travel dock specifically states bus-powered operation or requires its own separate power adapter before assuming any compact dock travels equally light."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Legacy VGA Support Remains Relevant for Older Conference Rooms and Classrooms Despite Modern HDMI Dominance",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo USB-C Mini Dock specifically includes a VGA port alongside HDMI, a legacy connector still found in some older conference rooms, classrooms, and projectors that haven't been upgraded to modern digital display standards, a real-world scenario the other three picks in this comparison don't address. This matters if you regularly present in venues you don't control and can't verify their display technology in advance, and matters less if you only ever connect to your own modern equipment. Consider the actual display technology available at your typical travel or presentation destinations before assuming every venue has upgraded past legacy VGA connections."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual HDMI Output Solves a Genuinely Different Travel Need Than Single-Display Portability",
    "explanation": "The Cable Matters 8-in-1 hub's dual HDMI ports let you drive two separate external displays simultaneously while traveling, useful for presentations requiring both a main screen and a confidence monitor, or simply working across two screens at a temporary desk, a capability the smaller Satechi Pro Hub Mini doesn't offer. This matters if your travel work regularly involves multi-monitor setups, and matters less if you're comfortable working on a single external display or your laptop's own screen while away from your main desk. Match your actual travel display needs (single screen versus multiple) against a dock's stated maximum display count before choosing based on portability alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cross-Brand Laptop Compatibility Claims Should Be Checked Against Your Specific Devices, Not Assumed Universal",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo USB-C Mini Dock specifically states compatibility with both Lenovo and Apple laptops, a genuinely useful cross-brand claim if your household or workplace mixes device brands, while other docks may be marketed primarily around one ecosystem even if the underlying USB4 or USB-C standard technically works more broadly. This matters if you need one travel dock to work reliably across multiple different laptop brands, and matters less if you only ever travel with one specific laptop. Check a listing's specifically stated compatible brands and models rather than assuming any USB-C or USB4 dock works identically across every laptop brand."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thunderbolt 4 Certification Provides a Verified Compatibility Baseline That Generic USB4 Branding Does Not",
    "explanation": "The EDiMAX pick specifically states Thunderbolt 4 certification with backward compatibility to Thunderbolt 3, a formal certification process that verifies interoperability standards beyond what a device simply labeled 'USB4 compatible' guarantees. This matters if compatibility assurance across a wide range of laptops is a priority when traveling to use the dock with potentially different host devices, and matters less if you always travel with the same laptop you've already confirmed works with the dock. Look for a specifically stated Thunderbolt certification, not just USB4 branding, if you want the strongest available compatibility assurance for a travel dock."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use the Satechi Pro Hub Mini with a Windows laptop, or is it Mac-only?", "a": "While the listing's specific compatibility notes focus heavily on MacBook Pro models, the underlying USB4 and USB-C standard generally works with compatible Windows laptops as well, though checking your specific Windows laptop's USB4 port capabilities against the hub's stated features is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a portable USB4 dock for travel?", "a": "Choosing the smallest, lightest option without checking whether it supports the specific number of displays or legacy connectors (like VGA) they'll actually need at their travel destinations, then discovering a display incompatibility while away from home." },
  { "q": "Is the EDiMAX dock worth packing its power adapter for, versus the bus-powered Satechi pick?", "a": "If you regularly need to drive multiple displays while traveling, the EDiMAX's included adapter and triple-display support are worth the extra bulk, but if you mainly need basic charging and a single display, the Satechi's bus-powered simplicity is lighter to travel with." },
  { "q": "How do I know if a hotel or conference room's projector will work with these docks' HDMI output?", "a": "Most modern venues have upgraded to HDMI, but for venues you're unsure about, packing a dock with a VGA fallback option like the Lenovo USB-C Mini Dock provides a safety net for older display technology." },
  { "q": "Do any of these portable docks include a carrying case or pouch?", "a": "None of the four picks in this comparison specifically mention an included carrying case, so checking each listing's exact package contents or purchasing a separate small pouch for storage during travel is worth considering." },
  { "q": "Can I charge my laptop and use an external display at the same time with these docks?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison support simultaneous charging and display output, though the specific charging wattage and display resolution combination available varies by pick, so checking your laptop's power draw against the dock's stated charging wattage is worth doing." }
