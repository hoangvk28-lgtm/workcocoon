  "Picking a mechanical keyboard layout starts with a question almost no buying guide actually asks you: what keys do you use every single day. Someone doing daily spreadsheet work needs a numpad, so a 65% layout is the wrong call. A developer who leans on F-keys for debugging needs those keys accessible, so a 60% layout with no dedicated F-row is the wrong call. The layout name on the box matters less than whether it matches your actual workflow.",
  "Below we explain what each major layout size actually gives up as it shrinks, then map 8 real mechanical keyboards we evaluated to their true layout size based on their real listings, from a 108-key full-size board with extra macro keys down to a tenkeyless 80% option, so you can match a layout to your workflow and then buy the matching pick immediately.",

    "explanation": "Switch type determines feel, sound, and how disruptive the keyboard is to people around you, clicky switches feel satisfying to type on solo but produce an audible click on every keystroke that can be genuinely disruptive on a Zoom call or in a shared office, while linear switches are quieter and smoother, and tactile switches split the difference with a felt bump but no click.\n\nThis matters directly based on where you'll actually use the keyboard, a home office with video calls or a shared workspace calls for a different switch than a private gaming setup where clicky feedback is a feature, not a liability.\n\nCheck the specific switch name (not just \"mechanical\") and look up its actuation force and whether it's linear, tactile, or clicky before assuming any mechanical keyboard suits your environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check hot-swappable sockets if you want to change switches later without soldering",
    "explanation": "A hot-swappable keyboard lets you physically remove and replace individual switches without any soldering, meaning you can try different switch types or replace a failed switch years later without needing to be a hobbyist with a soldering iron.\n\nThis matters directly if you're not fully certain which switch feel you'll prefer long-term, or if you want the option to upgrade switches later without replacing the whole keyboard.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"hot-swappable\" and the specific socket type (3-pin or 5-pin) it supports, since not every hot-swap socket accepts every switch type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider keycap material for both feel and long-term durability",
    "explanation": "Keycap material affects both the tactile feel under your fingers and how well the keycaps resist shine and wear over years of typing, PBT plastic is generally more durable and resists the glossy shine that ABS plastic keycaps develop after months of oil and friction from typing.\n\nThis matters more for a keyboard you'll type on daily for years, less for occasional or gaming-only use where keycap longevity matters less.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for PBT versus ABS keycap material, since this detail is sometimes buried in the specs rather than featured prominently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless convenience against connection latency for your actual use case",
    "explanation": "A wireless mechanical keyboard eliminates a desk cable but introduces a small amount of input latency compared to a wired connection, and Bluetooth in particular can have more noticeable latency than a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver, a real consideration for competitive gaming but largely unnoticeable for typing and general office work.\n\nThis matters more if you're specifically buying for fast-paced gaming, less for typing-focused office or home use where the latency difference is imperceptible.\n\nCheck whether a wireless keyboard supports a low-latency 2.4GHz dongle in addition to Bluetooth, and consider a wired connection specifically if competitive gaming performance matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match keyboard layout and size to your actual desk space and workflow",
    "explanation": "Mechanical keyboards range from full-size boards with a number pad to compact tenkeyless (no number pad) and even smaller 60% layouts that omit the function row and arrow keys, and this size choice is a real tradeoff between desk space saved and keys available without a modifier combination.\n\nThis matters directly if you regularly use a number pad for data entry, a compact layout without one adds real friction, while someone who never touches the number pad gains meaningful desk space and a shorter reach to the mouse with a smaller layout.\n\nCheck the specific layout size and key count against your actual daily workflow, not just desk space alone."

  {
    q: "What's the difference between TKL and 75% keyboard layouts?",
    a: "TKL (tenkeyless, also 80%) drops only the numpad, keeping the F-row and navigation cluster in their standard full-size positions. A 75% layout keeps the same keys as TKL but compresses them into a tighter cluster with less spacing, resulting in a smaller footprint but a slightly steeper adjustment period and more limited aftermarket keycap set compatibility.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a numpad on a mechanical keyboard?",
    a: "Only if your daily workflow includes regular numeric entry, like spreadsheets, accounting, or data entry. If you rarely type numbers outside the top row, a TKL or 75% layout saves desk space and reduces mouse reach without costing you anything you'd actually use day to day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why isn't there a 60% or 65% keyboard in this guide's picks?",
    a: "This guide only includes real, verified mechanical keyboards from the source product list, and the 8 that were genuinely mechanical and verifiable landed on full-size, TKL, or 75% layouts, none were true 60% or 65% boards. Rather than force an unrelated product into those categories, we explained what 60% and 65% layouts offer in the educational section above without a mismatched pick attached.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does keyboard layout size actually affect shoulder comfort?",
    a: "Yes, meaningfully. A full-size keyboard with a numpad pushes your mouse roughly 15 to 20cm further from your body's center compared to a TKL layout, requiring more shoulder extension on every reach. Dropping from full-size to TKL is the single biggest ergonomic gain available from layout choice alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my old keycap set fit a 75% keyboard?",
    a: "Not necessarily. A 75% layout's right-side cluster (Delete, Home, Page Up, Page Down) is often positioned differently than on a full-size or TKL board, and many aftermarket keycap sets don't include correctly shaped keys for that compressed cluster. Always check that a keycap set specifically lists 75% layout support before buying it for a board like the AULA F75 Pro.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are Alice and ortholinear layouts?",
    a: "An Alice layout splits and angles the key columns outward from a single connected frame for a more natural wrist angle, while an ortholinear layout arranges keys in a straight grid instead of the staggered rows on nearly every standard keyboard. Both are growing in availability but remain a smaller niche than standard full-size, TKL, 75%, 65%, and 60% layouts.",
