export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "HDMI vs DisplayPort vs VGA Isn't Just About Age",
    "explanation": "These three connector types aren't simply old versus new, they represent genuinely different practical tradeoffs. HDMI is the most universally supported across laptops, desktops, and even game consoles, and is generally the cheapest KVM option. DisplayPort carries more native bandwidth for higher resolutions and refresh rates without relying on compression, but a meaningful number of Mac computers don't have a DisplayPort output at all, which rules it out for a Mac-involved setup regardless of budget. VGA remains relevant only for genuinely older monitors or computers that predate widespread HDMI adoption. Check both of your computers' actual video outputs before choosing a connector type, not just what your monitor supports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 4K@60Hz Claim May Only Apply to One Port",
    "explanation": "Many budget KVM switches advertise 4K at 60Hz, but the internal chip handling that bandwidth sometimes can't sustain the full spec on every connected port simultaneously, meaning a second monitor or source can silently fall back to 30Hz. The practical difference matters beyond gaming: 30Hz introduces visible judder in cursor movement and video playback during ordinary office work, not just in graphics-intensive tasks. If a listing doesn't specify whether its 4K@60Hz rating applies per-port or only to a single primary connection, treat it as uncertain and check the product Q&A section or reviews for confirmation before assuming full performance across every port."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB 2.0 vs USB 3.0 Affects More Than Just Speed",
    "explanation": "A KVM switch's USB generation determines what you can reliably plug into it beyond a basic keyboard and mouse. USB 2.0 ports, common on the cheapest switches, offer far less bandwidth than USB 3.0's up to 5Gbps, which becomes a real bottleneck if you're sharing an external drive, webcam, or scanner rather than just input devices. If your use case is strictly keyboard and mouse sharing, USB 2.0 is genuinely sufficient and not worth paying extra to avoid; if you plan to share higher-bandwidth peripherals, confirm the switch specifically lists USB 3.0 ports before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "KVM Switches and Docking Stations Solve Different Problems",
    "explanation": "It's easy to conflate these two categories since both involve sharing connections, but a KVM switch lets two separate computers share one monitor, keyboard, and mouse, while a docking station expands the port count available to a single laptop. Combining a laptop docking station with a KVM switch in the same setup can cause port conflicts or bus-power issues, particularly on Mac hardware, and several listings in this category explicitly state they don't work through a docking station or USB hub at all. If your setup already involves a dock, check specifically whether the KVM switch you're considering supports that combination before assuming it will simply work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Switching Method Affects Where You Can Place the Unit",
    "explanation": "The cheapest KVM switches typically offer only a single physical button on the unit itself, meaning the switch has to sit somewhere within easy reach on your desk. Pricier options in this range add a small wired remote or desktop controller, letting you tuck the main switch behind a monitor or under the desk while keeping only the compact remote accessible. Neither approach is objectively better, but if desk space or cable tidiness matters to you, check specifically whether a listing includes a remote or extender before assuming every switch works the same way."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Audio Pass-Through Requires Manual Output Selection",
    "explanation": "If a KVM switch includes a 3.5mm audio-out port, getting sound to actually come through it typically requires each source computer's audio output to be manually set to that specific port in the operating system's sound settings, rather than defaulting to HDMI or DisplayPort audio. Most reported no-sound complaints on KVM switches trace back to this manual setting being overlooked rather than a defective unit. If audio pass-through matters for your setup, budget a few minutes after installation to check and set the correct output on each connected computer."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a budget KVM switch work with my MacBook?", "a": "It depends on the connector and specific model. Several HDMI-based switches in this price range work across Windows, Mac, and Linux without drivers, but DisplayPort switches are a bigger risk since many Mac computers don't have a native DisplayPort output at all. Some listings, like the HDMI KVM Switch with Wired Extend Controller in this comparison, explicitly advise against Mac use, so check the specific listing's compatibility notes rather than assuming universal support." },
  { "q": "My switch says 4K@60Hz but my second monitor looks choppy, why?", "a": "Many budget switches only guarantee the full 4K@60Hz spec on their primary port, with a second connection sometimes falling back to 30Hz, which shows visible judder in cursor movement and video, not just in gaming. If this happens, check whether the listing specified per-port bandwidth or only referenced a single connection in its marketing." },
  { "q": "Should I get an HDMI or DisplayPort KVM switch?", "a": "HDMI is the more universally compatible and generally cheaper choice, working across nearly all laptops, desktops, and even game consoles. DisplayPort offers more native bandwidth for high resolutions but requires both computers to have an actual DisplayPort output, which rules out many Macs and laptops that only expose USB-C or HDMI." },
  { "q": "Why is there no sound coming through my KVM switch's audio port?", "a": "This is almost always a settings issue rather than a defective switch. Check that your speakers are connected to the switch's dedicated audio-out port, and that each source computer's audio output is manually set to that port in its sound settings rather than defaulting to HDMI or DisplayPort audio." },
  { "q": "Can I use a KVM switch together with my laptop's docking station?", "a": "It's possible but not guaranteed to work smoothly. A KVM switch and a docking station solve different problems, one shares a monitor and peripherals between two computers, the other expands ports on a single laptop, and stacking them can cause port conflicts or bus-power issues, especially on Mac hardware. Several listings in this category explicitly state they don't support docking stations, so check before assuming compatibility." },
  { "q": "Does a KVM switch need its own power supply?", "a": "Most budget KVM switches, including every pick in this comparison, are bus-powered directly through the connected USB cable and don't require a separate power adapter. This keeps setup simple, though it does mean the switch depends on the connected computer's USB port providing adequate power." }
