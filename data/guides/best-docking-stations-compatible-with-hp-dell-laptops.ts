  "Docking stations for HP and Dell laptops come with naming conventions that trip up a lot of buyers. Dell's \"WD\" prefix marks its dock line, WD19, WD22TB4, and so on, with the number roughly indicating the era and \"TB4\" specifically denoting Thunderbolt 4 support versus older USB-C-only WD docks. HP splits its lineup into business-tier G-series docks, built for EliteBook, ZBook, and ProBook laptops, versus generic consumer USB-C hubs, and the G-series docks in this guide are that stricter business tier.\n\nBelow are 8 docking stations we evaluated on official HP and Dell compatibility, business-tier durability, power delivery, and IT-fleet relevance, ranging from a $62.17 renewed HP dock to a 180W Dell Thunderbolt 4 dock built for Precision workstation laptops.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "What does the \"WD\" and \"TB4\" mean in Dell dock names?",
    a: "The \"WD\" prefix marks Dell's dock product line, and the number after it roughly indicates the generation or era. \"TB4\" specifically denotes Thunderbolt 4 support, distinguishing it from older USB-C-only WD docks. Always match the exact model number to your Dell laptop's supported dock list on Dell's own compatibility page rather than assuming any \"Dell dock\" works with any \"Dell laptop.\"",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between HP's G-series docks and a generic USB-C hub?",
    a: "HP's G-series docks, like the G5 and G6 in this guide, are business-tier hardware sold and validated specifically for HP EliteBook, ZBook, and ProBook laptops. They're generally built to stricter enterprise durability and compatibility testing standards than a generic no-name USB-C hub, which matters for buyers replacing a dock in an office IT-managed fleet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it safe to buy a renewed HP or Dell docking station?",
    a: "Renewed official docks are a legitimate way to get business-tier hardware at a lower price. The main thing to confirm before buying is whether the listing includes the dock's original power adapter, since a third-party replacement adapter is the most common complaint with used official docks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why isn't my HP or Dell laptop charging at full speed through the dock?",
    a: "A dock rated for a given wattage typically delivers about 10-15W less to the laptop once its own circuitry draws its share. This matters most for HP ZBook and Dell Precision workstation laptops needing 100-170W under load, which may not charge at full speed from a dock rated lower than that real requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a Thunderbolt-certified dock, or will USB4 work with my Dell or HP laptop?",
    a: "USB4 docks are broadly \"should work\" compatible with Thunderbolt devices, but they lack the strict Intel certification that guarantees Thunderbolt 4 or 5 compatibility. If your laptop has a genuine Thunderbolt port, a certified pick like the Dell WD22TB4 series removes that layer of guesswork.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my company IT department require a specific dock model?",
    a: "Official Dell and HP business docks are commonly deployed in corporate IT fleets because they support features like network boot (PXE) and sit on the vendor's official approved hardware compatibility lists. A generic third-party dock might be technically compatible but isn't necessarily approved by IT policy for a company-owned laptop.",
