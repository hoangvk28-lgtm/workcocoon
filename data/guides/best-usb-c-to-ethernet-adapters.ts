export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C is a connector, not a speed",
    "explanation": "A USB-C port can carry anywhere from 1Gbps to 10Gbps of Ethernet depending on the adapter's chipset and your host's actual USB generation. Check the exact Ethernet speed and required USB mode before assuming any USB-C adapter matches your needs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speeds need a fast enough USB port",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G, 5G, or 10G adapter plugged into a basic USB 3.0 (5Gbps) port will not reach its rated Ethernet speed. 2.5G generally works on 5Gbps ports; 5G and 10G typically need a USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) port or Thunderbolt/USB4 host."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check OS and driver requirements before buying",
    "explanation": "Most Gigabit adapters are driver-free on Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS, but multi-gig adapters often need a manufacturer driver on Windows or specific Linux kernel versions, and some models exclude older Apple silicon chips entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your specific device isn't excluded",
    "explanation": "Several adapters in this cluster explicitly do not work with Nintendo Switch, Android, or specific Mac chip generations. Read the compatibility list carefully rather than assuming a USB-C connector guarantees your device will work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A CAT6 cable matters as much as the adapter",
    "explanation": "Even a genuine Gigabit-capable adapter will fall back to slower speeds over an old CAT5 cable. Use CAT6 or better for Gigabit, and CAT6A for 5G/10G speeds, to actually realize the adapter's rated performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PD passthrough wattage isn't automatically usable",
    "explanation": "An adapter rated for 100W or 140W Power Delivery passthrough only delivers that much power if you also supply a charger and cable rated for it. The adapter's rating is a ceiling, not a guarantee, without the matching charger."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Will any USB-C to Ethernet adapter reach full Gigabit speed?",
    "a": "Only if your host port and cable support it. You need a CAT6 or better Ethernet cable and a USB-C port capable of at least USB 3.0 to reliably hit 1Gbps; older CAT5 cables or USB 2.0 ports will cap the connection well below the adapter's rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why do some adapters not work with Nintendo Switch?",
    "a": "Compatibility depends on how the adapter's chipset identifies itself to the host. Several adapters in this cluster, including uni and BENFEI's basic models, explicitly state they do not work with Switch, while UGREEN and Amazon Basics do support it. Always check the specific listing rather than assuming any USB-C Ethernet adapter works."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need to install a driver?",
    "a": "Most Gigabit adapters are driver-free on Windows 10/11, macOS, and ChromeOS. Windows XP/7/Vista and many Linux distributions typically require a manual driver install, which the better listings walk you through."
