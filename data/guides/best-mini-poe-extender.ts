export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Mini Extender's Compact Size Doesn't Necessarily Mean Reduced Power Output Capability",
    "explanation": "The CONETCH pick specifically packs up to 60W of total power output into a 4-inch by 1.3-inch by 0.8-inch footprint, showing that a genuinely compact physical size doesn't automatically mean a lower-wattage or less capable device compared to larger extenders. This matters if you need to fit a capable extender into a genuinely tight installation space like a crowded networking cabinet without sacrificing power delivery to your connected devices. Check a mini extender's actual wattage specification rather than assuming its small size means reduced capability compared to a larger unit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Two-Wire Extension Technology Can Reach Distances Far Beyond Standard PoE Extenders by Reusing Existing Wiring",
    "explanation": "The 2-Wire Kit specifically reaches up to 2,624ft using just a spare pair of wires from existing Cat5e/Cat6 cable, alarm wiring, or even coax, a fundamentally different approach from standard PoE extenders that require dedicated network cable runs for their entire distance. This matters significantly if you have existing spare wiring in a building that could be repurposed to avoid running new cable to a remote location, and matters less if you're installing fresh cabling anyway. Check whether a mini extender's technology can specifically reuse existing spare wire pairs if that could save a genuinely expensive or impractical new cable run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zero Local Power at the Remote End Eliminates the Need for an Electrician or Wall Outlet at That Location",
    "explanation": "The 2-Wire Kit's remote unit specifically requires no local power source at all, drawing everything it needs from the same two wires carrying data, meaning an IP camera or access point at a remote location can be powered without any electrician work or nearby outlet. This matters significantly if your remote installation location genuinely lacks any nearby power source, and matters less if a standard outlet is already available at that location. Check whether an extender's remote end requires local power before assuming a standard PoE extender or the 2-Wire kit is the right fit for a power-inaccessible location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Pack Kits Deliver Better Per-Unit Value When Extending Several Separate Device Runs",
    "explanation": "The CENTROPOWER 5-Pack Kit specifically bundles five single-channel extenders in one purchase, working out to a lower per-unit cost than buying five separate single extenders individually, a real value consideration for a multi-camera installation needing several independent extension points. This matters if you're deploying multiple cameras or devices that each need their own separate extension run, and matters less if you only need to extend a single device. Compare a multi-pack's total price divided by unit count against individual single-unit prices before assuming a single-unit purchase is always more economical."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Robust Electrical Protection Specifications Matter Even on a Genuinely Compact Device",
    "explanation": "The CONETCH pick specifically states 6KV lightning protection and 8KV electrostatic discharge protection despite its small 4-inch footprint, showing that a compact size doesn't have to come at the cost of reduced electrical safeguarding compared to larger extenders. This matters if your installation faces real electrical surge or static discharge risk, and matters less in a stable, sheltered indoor environment with minimal electrical exposure. Check a mini extender's specific surge and ESD protection ratings rather than assuming its compact size means reduced electrical protection compared to a larger, similarly priced alternative."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does a mini PoE extender's compact size mean it delivers less power than a full-size extender?", "a": "Not necessarily; the CONETCH pick specifically delivers up to 60W of total power output despite its genuinely compact 4-inch footprint, so checking the actual wattage specification rather than assuming size correlates with capability is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a mini PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming a compact size automatically means reduced distance or power capability, when the picks in this comparison show genuinely compact units can match or exceed the specifications of larger extenders." },
  { "q": "Is the 2-Wire Kit worth the much higher price over the compact multi-port picks?", "a": "If you specifically need to reach an extreme distance over existing spare wiring with zero local power at the remote end, the 2-Wire Kit's unique technology justifies its price, but for standard installation distances, the compact multi-port picks deliver much better value." },
  { "q": "Can I use the EmpireTech passive splitter with any PoE camera?", "a": "The EmpireTech listing specifically confirms compatibility with standard PoE IP cameras through its passive design, though checking your specific camera's PoE standard compatibility against the listing before buying is always worth doing." },
  { "q": "How much can I save by buying the CENTROPOWER 5-pack instead of five individual extenders?", "a": "The 5-pack's bundled price works out to a meaningfully lower per-unit cost than purchasing five separate single-channel extenders individually, making it the better value specifically when you need to extend multiple separate device runs." },
  { "q": "Does the 2-Wire Kit work over any type of existing cable?", "a": "The listing specifically states it works over a spare pair inside existing Cat5e or Cat6 cable, alarm cable, intercom or bell wire, or coax through included BNC adapters, though wire gauge and insulation quality determine how far the link actually reaches." }
