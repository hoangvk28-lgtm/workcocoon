export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "Is $500 worth it vs $300 for a standing desk?",
    a: "Yes - the single most impactful upgrade is dual motors. At $300 you may get dual motor with compromises (low warranty, limited height range). At $400-$500, dual motor comes with 5-year warranties, 3-stage columns for wider height range, and 220-330 lb capacity. If you plan to use the desk daily for 3+ years, the $150-$200 difference is worth it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What standing desk height is ergonomic?",
    a: "At sitting height: elbows at 90 degrees, forearms parallel to the floor, wrists neutral. At standing height: same - elbows at 90 degrees, monitor at eye level. Most users need to adjust 1-2 inches from their calculated height to account for keyboard thickness and mouse pad.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should you stand at a standing desk?",
    a: "The research consensus is 20-30 minutes standing per hour - not standing all day. A common protocol is 50 minutes sitting and 10 minutes standing per hour. The key benefit is breaking prolonged static sitting, not maximizing standing time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an anti-fatigue mat with a standing desk?",
    a: "Yes for standing sessions over 10-15 minutes on hard floors. An anti-fatigue mat reduces leg and lower back fatigue by encouraging subtle micro-movements. Budget $25-$50 for a basic mat and $60-$100 for a contoured ergonomic mat.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I put a monitor arm on a standing desk under $500?",
    a: "Yes - all five desks in this guide support standard monitor arms (VESA 75x75 or 100x100). The FlexiSpot EC3 (275 lb) and Fezibo Triple Motor (330 lb) provide the most overhead capacity for heavy dual-arm configurations.",
