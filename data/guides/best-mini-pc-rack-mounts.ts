  "Rack mounting is a specialized use case, most common for home server setups and small IT deployments, and it is genuinely different from the under-desk and wall mounting covered in our other Mini PC mount guides. A rack mount has to fit a standard rack unit (U) height, work inside a 19-inch or 10-inch cabinet, and hold up under the kind of continuous workload and denser cabling a home server or small server closet involves.",
  "We started from a wider pool of candidate ASINs for this guide and cut it down honestly. Two products initially considered here, marketed as under-desk mounts, do not fit a 19-inch rack cabinet at all and were removed rather than stretched to fill out the list. That leaves four genuine rack-mount products, a narrower count than our other Mini PC mount guides, but every pick here is an actual rack-format product, not a relabeled desk mount.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify your exact mini PC model against the mount's stated compatibility list",
    "explanation": "Mini PC mounts and brackets are built around specific chassis dimensions and screw-hole patterns, and unlike a universal VESA monitor mount, many mini PC brackets are designed for one specific brand's chassis shape, such as Dell OptiPlex Micro, Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny, HP EliteDesk Mini, or a specific generation of Mac mini.\n\nMounting hardware that doesn't match your exact model can fail to align with the screw holes at all, or worse, only partially secure the device, creating a real risk of it working loose over time in a mount that's supposed to hold it stationary.\n\nCheck the listing's stated compatible models and generations specifically against your own mini PC's exact model number, not just the general \"mini PC\" category claim in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the mount's actual mounting surface (VESA, rack, wall, or under-desk) matches your install location",
    "explanation": "Mini PC mounts split into genuinely different installation categories: VESA mounts attach to the back of a monitor or TV using the standardized VESA hole pattern, rack mounts fit a 10-inch home-lab or 19-inch commercial server rack, wall mounts attach directly to drywall or a stud, and under-desk mounts clamp to the underside of a desk surface, and these are not interchangeable hardware despite all falling under the same general product category.\n\nBuying a rack-format shelf when you actually need a VESA bracket, for instance, means the hardware simply won't attach to your intended surface at all, since the mounting mechanism itself is fundamentally different between categories.\n\nIdentify your specific installation surface first (monitor back, rack, wall, or desk underside) and filter specifically for that mount type, rather than searching generically for \"mini PC mount\" and assuming any result will work for your setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the stated weight capacity against your mini PC's actual weight",
    "explanation": "A mount's weight capacity, when disclosed, reflects how much load the bracket's screws, arms, and adhesive or clamping mechanism can safely hold long-term without gradually sagging, loosening, or failing outright, and mini PCs vary meaningfully in weight depending on their chassis material and internal components, from under a pound for the lightest fanless designs to several pounds for units with larger heatsinks or multiple drive bays.\n\nMounting a device at or near a bracket's rated limit, especially on a mount holding the device at an angle or overhead behind a monitor, leaves little margin for the natural loosening that happens over months of use, vibration, or repeated adjustment.\n\nWeigh your specific mini PC model (check its listed weight spec) against the mount's stated capacity, and favor a mount with meaningful headroom above your device's actual weight rather than one rated right at the edge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider port and cable access after the mount is installed, not just before",
    "explanation": "A mini PC's ports are typically concentrated on the rear and sometimes front panel, and once mounted, especially behind a monitor, inside a rack, or under a desk, those ports can become significantly harder to reach for routine tasks like plugging in a USB drive or checking a status light, even though the mount holds the device perfectly securely.\n\nSome mounts are specifically designed to preserve front-panel port access after installation, while others prioritize a low-profile or flush mount that trades away easy access for a cleaner look, and this is a real day-to-day usability tradeoff that photos alone don't always make obvious.\n\nThink through which ports you'll need to access regularly after mounting (power, a USB drive, HDMI swaps) and check whether the specific mount's design keeps those reachable, rather than only checking that it physically holds the device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what installation hardware is actually included versus what you'll need to source separately",
    "explanation": "Mount listings vary in how complete their included hardware kit is, some ship with every screw, VESA adapter plate, and cable tie needed for a full installation, while others assume you already have compatible mounting screws from the mini PC's original packaging or a previous mount, which isn't always the case if you're mounting a device for the first time or switching setups.\n\nThis matters because discovering mid-installation that you're missing a specific screw size or an adapter plate means a delayed setup and a second order, a genuinely avoidable frustration.\n\nCheck the listing's stated included contents specifically, and if you no longer have your mini PC's original mounting screws, confirm the mount ships with compatible replacements rather than assuming they're included by default."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Can I use an under-desk Mini PC mount in a 19-inch rack instead?", a: "No. Under-desk mounts do not match rack rail dimensions or rack unit (U) height, and will not install in a standard 19-inch or 10-inch rack cabinet. We removed two such products from our original candidate list for this guide for exactly that reason." },
  { q: "How many Mini PCs fit in one rack unit?", a: "Most trays in this guide hold one Mini PC per 1U slot. The 19in 1U Mini PC Rack Mount for 2 Units is the exception, fitting two Mini PCs side by side in a single rack unit." },
  { q: "Do these mounts fit any Mini PC brand?", a: "Two picks here are brand-specific, built for named HP or Lenovo ThinkCentre models. The other two support a wider named list including Dell OptiPlex Micro, Lenovo ThinkCentre, and HP Desktop Mini within a stated size range." },
  { q: "Is a 10-inch rack the same as a 19-inch rack, just smaller?", a: "No, they use different rail widths and hardware is not interchangeable between them. Confirm your cabinet's actual rail width before ordering any rack mount, including the picks in this guide." },
  { q: "Why does this guide only have 4 picks compared to your other Mini PC mount guides?", a: "Genuine rack-mount hardware for Mini PCs is a narrow, specialized category compared to under-desk or wall mounting. We would rather show four verified rack-format products than pad the list with under-desk mounts that do not actually fit a rack." },
