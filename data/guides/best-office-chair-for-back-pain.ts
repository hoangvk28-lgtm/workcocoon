  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What type of chair is best for lower back pain?", a: "For lower back pain, the most important chair features are: adjustable lumbar height (not just depth) so the support contacts your actual L4/L5 zone, adjustable seat depth so the pelvis tilts forward correctly, and a dynamic tilt mechanism that allows micro-movement throughout the day. Chairs with these three features include the Steelcase Leap V2, Herman Miller Embody, and Branch Ergonomic at different price points." },
  { q: "Can a new office chair actually reduce back pain?", a: "Yes, within limits. A chair with correct lumbar support, proper seat depth, and appropriate seat height reduces the mechanical stressors that cause and worsen most seated back pain. If your pain is caused or worsened by poor seated posture (which is the majority of desk-related back pain), switching to a properly adjusted ergonomic chair will typically provide noticeable improvement within 2 to 4 weeks. For pain caused by structural issues (herniation, stenosis), a chair is a supportive measure not a treatment - consult a physical therapist." },
  { q: "Is a standing desk also necessary if I have back pain?", a: "Standing desks are complementary to a good ergonomic chair, not a replacement. Prolonged standing also causes back pain. The benefit is alternating postures throughout the day, which distributes spinal load across different muscle groups and prevents the sustained compression of a single position. If you have back pain, a good chair for sitting intervals combined with a standing desk for standing intervals is more effective than either alone. See our full [best standing desks](/guide/best-standing-desk-under-1000) guide." },
  { q: "What is sciatica and which chairs help with it?", a: "Sciatica is pain radiating from the lower back down the leg along the sciatic nerve path, typically caused by lumbar disc herniation or piriformis compression. Chairs that help: those with a coccyx cutout or contoured seat that reduces direct sacral pressure (HON, some executive chairs), and saddle chairs (HAG Capisco) that tilt the pelvis forward and reduce disc compression. Chairs that worsen sciatica: those with hard seat edges that compress the piriformis, or bucket-shaped gaming seats that reduce external hip rotation." },
  { q: "How long does it take for a chair to help with back pain?", a: "Most users with posture-related back pain notice improvement within 2 to 4 weeks of switching to a correctly adjusted ergonomic chair. The adjustment period includes both the body adapting to a new supported posture and the muscles that have been compensating for poor posture beginning to release. Correct setup is critical - a poorly adjusted ergonomic chair can make back pain worse than a well-adjusted standard chair." },
