    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best office chair often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best office chair holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best office chair over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best office chair you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best office chair that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What type of chair is best for lower back pain?", a: "For lower back pain, the most important chair features are: adjustable lumbar height (not just depth) so the support contacts your actual L4/L5 zone, adjustable seat depth so the pelvis tilts forward correctly, and a dynamic tilt mechanism that allows micro-movement throughout the day. Chairs with these three features include the Steelcase Leap V2, Herman Miller Embody, and Branch Ergonomic at different price points." },
  { q: "Can a new office chair actually reduce back pain?", a: "Yes, within limits. A chair with correct lumbar support, proper seat depth, and appropriate seat height reduces the mechanical stressors that cause and worsen most seated back pain. If your pain is caused or worsened by poor seated posture (which is the majority of desk-related back pain), switching to a properly adjusted ergonomic chair will typically provide noticeable improvement within 2 to 4 weeks. For pain caused by structural issues (herniation, stenosis), a chair is a supportive measure not a treatment - consult a physical therapist." },
  { q: "Is a standing desk also necessary if I have back pain?", a: "Standing desks are complementary to a good ergonomic chair, not a replacement. Prolonged standing also causes back pain. The benefit is alternating postures throughout the day, which distributes spinal load across different muscle groups and prevents the sustained compression of a single position. If you have back pain, a good chair for sitting intervals combined with a standing desk for standing intervals is more effective than either alone. See our full [best standing desks](/guide/best-standing-desk-under-1000) guide." },
  { q: "What is sciatica and which chairs help with it?", a: "Sciatica is pain radiating from the lower back down the leg along the sciatic nerve path, typically caused by lumbar disc herniation or piriformis compression. Chairs that help: those with a coccyx cutout or contoured seat that reduces direct sacral pressure (HON, some executive chairs), and saddle chairs (HAG Capisco) that tilt the pelvis forward and reduce disc compression. Chairs that worsen sciatica: those with hard seat edges that compress the piriformis, or bucket-shaped gaming seats that reduce external hip rotation." },
  { q: "How long does it take for a chair to help with back pain?", a: "Most users with posture-related back pain notice improvement within 2 to 4 weeks of switching to a correctly adjusted ergonomic chair. The adjustment period includes both the body adapting to a new supported posture and the muscles that have been compensating for poor posture beginning to release. Correct setup is critical - a poorly adjusted ergonomic chair can make back pain worse than a well-adjusted standard chair." },
