export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify clamp desk-thickness range against your specific desk edge",
    "explanation": "A clamp-on privacy panel's mounting mechanism has a maximum and minimum desk edge thickness it can grip securely, and this range varies between products even at a similar price, some fit only a standard half-inch desktop while others accommodate a thicker standing-desk edge or a rounded lip.\n\nThis matters directly because a clamp that's too narrow simply won't close around your desk, and one that's mismatched for a thin edge won't grip securely, risking the panel slipping or tipping under normal use.\n\nMeasure your desk edge thickness in inches and compare it against the exact clamp range stated in the product specs before ordering, not just assuming any clamp fits any desk."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for genuine acoustic dampening material, not just a visual divider",
    "explanation": "A privacy panel described as \"acoustic\" or \"sound-absorbing\" should use a real sound-dampening material, typically a felt or fabric-wrapped foam core, that measurably reduces noise transmission, distinct from a simple solid panel that only blocks visual sightlines without doing anything meaningful for sound.\n\nThis distinction matters directly if noise reduction for calls or focused work is your actual goal, a solid plastic or acrylic divider blocks the view but does very little to dampen adjacent conversation or keyboard noise.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated acoustic material (felt, foam core, or similar), not just the word \"acoustic\" in the title with no supporting material description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match panel height and width to your actual sightline and desk width",
    "explanation": "A panel too short leaves your eyeline exposed above it while seated, defeating the purpose of visual privacy, while a panel too narrow leaves gaps at the sides where a neighboring desk's activity remains visible, and both dimensions need to be checked against your actual seated eye height and desk width, not assumed from a generic \"privacy panel\" label.\n\nThis matters more in an open shared office layout with desks close together, less if the panel is mainly decorative or for a single dedicated home office desk.\n\nCheck the listed panel height against your seated eye height, and the width against your desk's actual width, before assuming any panel provides real coverage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider foldable versus fixed mounting for how permanent you need the setup",
    "explanation": "A foldable privacy panel can be collapsed flat or repositioned when not needed, useful for a shared desk or a space that serves multiple purposes throughout the day, while a fixed clamp-mounted panel offers a more stable, permanent barrier but stays in place whether you need it in that moment or not.\n\nThis matters directly if your desk needs to switch between a private, focused-work configuration and an open, collaborative one, a foldable design accommodates that flexibility, a fixed panel doesn't.\n\nConsider how consistently you'll actually want the panel up before choosing a fixed mount over a foldable design."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh material and finish against long-term durability and cleaning ease",
    "explanation": "Panel materials range from rigid acrylic or PET plastic to fabric-wrapped foam, and each comes with a different durability and maintenance profile, a hard plastic panel wipes clean easily but offers no acoustic benefit, while a fabric-wrapped acoustic panel dampens sound but can show wear, staining, or fraying edges faster over months of daily contact.\n\nThis matters more in a shared or high-traffic office setting where the panel gets bumped or touched regularly, less in a private home office where it stays relatively undisturbed.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific material and any stated durability or cleaning guidance before assuming any panel material holds up equally well over time."
