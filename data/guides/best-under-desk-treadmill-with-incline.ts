  "An under desk treadmill with incline adds real calorie burn over a flat walking pad, but it also raises the bar on what you need to check before buying: incline type (manual lever versus motorized auto-incline), motor power, and most importantly whether the unit actually fits the clearance under your desk. Standard desks run 28-30 inches tall, and most under-desk treadmills need roughly 9-12 inches of vertical clearance between the floor and the underside of the desk, so the listed desk height alone doesn't tell you if a given unit will fit.",

    "explanation": "An under-desk treadmill needs to physically slide into the same clearance a chair would otherwise occupy, and this clearance varies by desk, both the standing desk's lowest sit height and any crossbar or cable tray underneath can limit how tall a treadmill fits.\n\nThis matters because a treadmill that looks compact in photos can still be too tall for your specific desk's clearance, a mismatch that's only discovered after the treadmill arrives.\n\nMeasure the actual clear height under your desk at its lowest working position, and compare that against the treadmill's listed height, leaving real margin rather than an exact match."

    "explanation": "Most under-desk treadmills are built for a slow 1-4 mph walking pace during work, not a running pace, and their motors are sized accordingly, a lighter-duty motor rated for walking speeds will struggle or wear out faster if pushed toward running speeds it wasn't designed for.\n\nThis matters directly if you're specifically hoping to run rather than walk while working, a genuine running-capable treadmill needs a meaningfully more powerful motor and a different category of product than most under-desk walking pads.\n\nCheck the listed max speed and motor horsepower rating against your actual intended pace, and don't assume any \"treadmill\" labeled product supports running speeds."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check noise level specifically for video calls and shared office spaces",
    "explanation": "A treadmill's motor and belt generate continuous noise while walking, and that noise level matters far more for this category than a typical treadmill, since you'll likely be on video calls or in a shared workspace while using it, a treadmill quiet enough for a private home gym can still be distracting on a work call in an open office.\n\nThis matters more the more of your work involves calls or a shared space, less if you work in a private office with the door closed.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for noise mentions during video calls or in shared spaces, not just a general decibel rating that may be measured under different conditions."

    "explanation": "An auto-stop safety cord (clipped to your clothing, stopping the belt if you step off unexpectedly) and a remote or app-based start/stop control matter more for this category than a typical gym treadmill, since you'll be dividing attention between the treadmill and actual work rather than fully focused on walking.\n\nThis matters because a moment of distraction while multitasking is exactly when an unexpected stumble is most likely, and having quick, reliable stop control reduces that risk.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a safety cord and remote control features, not just speed and incline specs."

    q: "How much clearance do I need under my desk for a treadmill with incline?",
    a: "Most under-desk treadmills need about 9-12 inches of vertical clearance between the floor and the underside of the desk. Standard desks run 28-30 inches tall, but that listed height doesn't account for crossbars or cable trays that reduce usable space, so measure the actual clearance under your specific desk before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between auto-incline and manual incline?",
    a: "Auto-incline, used in the TRAILVIBER and TOPUTURE picks in this guide, changes levels via a remote or app without stepping off the belt. Manual incline requires stepping off or reaching down to adjust a mechanical lever, which is far less convenient during a work call. Incline increases calorie burn substantially over flat walking either way, but auto-incline is the more practical option for workday use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are brushless motors actually quieter than standard treadmill motors?",
    a: "Yes, brushless motors run meaningfully quieter than older motor designs, which matters most if your desk sits in a shared home office or you take calls while walking. The FOUSAE and TOPUTURE picks in this guide both use brushless motors.",
  },
  {
    q: "What safety features should an under-desk treadmill with incline have?",
    a: "Look for an auto-stop sensor that halts the belt if you step off, and a soft-start feature that begins the belt at a very low speed. Soft-start specifically reduces the chance of being caught off guard when the belt begins moving, which matters more on incline models where footing is slightly less stable than flat walking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick in this guide has the steepest incline?",
    a: "The TOPUTURE Walking Pad Treadmill has the steepest range in this guide at up to 15% across 15 automatically adjustable levels, controlled by remote or app. The TRAILVIBER is the next steepest at 12% across 9 auto-adjusted levels.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where should I route the power cord on an under-desk treadmill?",
    a: "Route it away from your walking path, along a wall or under a cord cover, rather than leaving it loose on the floor. Cable management matters more for a treadmill than most desk gear because you're walking on or near the unit, and a snagged cord is a real trip hazard on a moving belt.",
