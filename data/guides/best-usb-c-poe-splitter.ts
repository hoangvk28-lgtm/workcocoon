export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Reaching a Splitter's Maximum Advertised Amperage Often Requires an 802.3at PoE+ Source, Not Just Any PoE Switch",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit PoE Splitter USB C 3.5A pick specifically states that connecting to a standard 802.3af switch limits output to 2.4A, with the full 3.5A only available on an 802.3at PoE+ switch or injector, a real distinction that determines whether you actually get the splitter's headline amperage figure. This matters significantly if you're buying a high-amperage splitter specifically for its higher rating but plan to use it with existing standard 802.3af infrastructure, since you won't receive the advertised performance without upgrading your PoE source. Check whether a splitter's maximum amperage requires 802.3at PoE+ specifically, and verify your actual PoE switch or injector's standard, before assuming you'll receive the full advertised output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C PoE Splitters Typically Don't Support USB Power Delivery or Quick Charge Fast-Charging Protocols",
    "explanation": "Multiple picks in this comparison explicitly state they do not support PD or QC fast charging protocols, meaning a device expecting to negotiate a higher voltage through USB-C Power Delivery won't receive that negotiation from these splitters, which output a fixed 5V regardless of the connected device's fast-charging capability. This matters if your specific device relies on PD negotiation to reach its full charging speed or a higher voltage, and matters less for devices like a Raspberry Pi that simply need stable 5V power without any negotiation protocol. Verify your specific device only requires fixed 5V power, not PD or QC negotiation, before relying on a USB-C PoE splitter as its power source."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A USB-C PoE Splitter Can Exceed the Official Raspberry Pi PoE HAT's Power Ceiling for Demanding Applications",
    "explanation": "The UCTRONICS 4A pick specifically positions itself as exceeding the official Raspberry Pi PoE HAT's 2.5A maximum output, a genuine advantage for a Pi 4 running multiple demanding tasks or attached peripherals that draw more power than the official HAT can reliably supply. This matters if you've experienced power-related instability with the official PoE HAT under heavy load, and matters less if your Pi runs lighter workloads comfortably within the HAT's standard capability. Consider a higher-amperage third-party splitter specifically if you've encountered power limitations with the official PoE HAT under your actual workload."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Documented Range Beyond the Standard 100m PoE Limit Can Matter for Devices Positioned Farther From the Source",
    "explanation": "The UCTRONICS 2.4A pick specifically documents a range up to 300ft, meaningfully longer than the standard 100m (328ft) PoE limit most splitters reference, giving real flexibility for a device positioned farther from the PoE source than typical. This matters if your specific installation requires reaching a device near or beyond the standard 100m cable limit, and matters less if your device sits comfortably within that standard range. Check a splitter's specifically documented maximum range if your installation distance approaches or exceeds the standard 100m PoE limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Industrial-Grade Isolation and Surge Protection Specifications Matter for 24/7 Continuous Operation",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit PoE Splitter USB C 3.5A pick specifically states 2.5KV isolation with short-circuit, overvoltage, and surge protection built for 24/7 continuous operation, a more detailed electrical protection specification than a generic 'protected' claim without a stated isolation voltage. This matters if your USB-C powered device runs continuously without interruption, like a Raspberry Pi server or a permanently mounted camera, where electrical protection reliability matters more over sustained operation, and matters less for an occasionally used device. Check for specifically named isolation voltage and surge protection ratings if your device will run continuously in a 24/7 deployment."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will I get the full advertised amperage from any USB-C PoE splitter on my existing PoE switch?", "a": "Not necessarily; the higher-amperage picks in this comparison specifically require an 802.3at PoE+ switch or injector to reach their full rating, dropping to a lower output like 2.4A on a standard 802.3af switch, so checking your PoE infrastructure's exact standard is important." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a USB-C PoE splitter?", "a": "Assuming a high-amperage splitter will deliver its full advertised output regardless of the PoE source, when several splitters specifically cap their output on standard 802.3af switches and only reach their maximum rating on 802.3at PoE+ infrastructure." },
  { "q": "Is the UCTRONICS 4A splitter worth the higher price over the 3.5A Gigabit pick?", "a": "If you need the absolute maximum amperage for a genuinely power-hungry multi-Pi setup, the UCTRONICS 4A pick's higher price is justified, but the Gigabit 3.5A pick delivers nearly as much power at roughly half the cost for most demanding use cases." },
  { "q": "Can I use a USB-C PoE splitter to fast-charge my phone?", "a": "No, these splitters specifically don't support PD or QC fast charging protocols, delivering only fixed 5V power, so they're suited for devices like a Raspberry Pi that need stable 5V rather than phones expecting fast-charge negotiation." },
  { "q": "Do I need the highest-amperage splitter for a basic Raspberry Pi 4 setup?", "a": "Not necessarily; a standard Raspberry Pi 4 running typical workloads is usually fine with a 2.4A splitter, and the higher-amperage picks are specifically worth it only if you're running demanding applications or multiple attached peripherals that increase power draw." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my PoE switch is 802.3af or 802.3at?", "a": "Checking your PoE switch or injector's product documentation or specification label for its exact IEEE standard compliance is the reliable way to confirm whether you have standard 802.3af or higher-power 802.3at PoE+ before choosing a USB-C splitter." }
