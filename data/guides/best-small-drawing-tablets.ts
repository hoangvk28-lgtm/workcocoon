Every purchase includes real creative software and access to Wacom's online training, a genuine value-add most budget tablets skip entirely.\n\nAs a screenless pen tablet, it maps to your existing monitor rather than adding a second display, keeping the setup simple and the price low. Wacom backs it with over 40 years in the category, which shows up in driver maturity and long-term software compatibility.",

The box includes ten replacement nibs and a pen clipper alongside the stylus.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much smaller is the usable area on small drawing tablets compared to full-size tablets?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Is a portable tablet worth it if I mostly draw at a fixed desk?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. If you don't need to travel with it, a larger fixed-desk tablet often gives more active area and features for a similar price."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."

  {
    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
