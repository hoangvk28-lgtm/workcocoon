export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Expect real-world sheet capacity to run below the rated figure",
    "explanation": "A shredder's rated sheet capacity, like \"10-sheet\" or \"15-sheet\", is measured under ideal lab conditions with fresh, single-type paper fed perfectly straight, real-world use with mixed paper stock, folded sheets, or slightly misaligned feeding typically shreds closer to 70-80% of the rated capacity before jamming or straining the motor.\n\nThis matters because buying exactly at your expected daily volume often means the shredder is already operating past its comfortable real-world limit on day one.\n\nSize up from your actual typical stack thickness rather than matching the rated number exactly, and check reviews for mentions of real-world jamming at the rated capacity."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match security level (P-rating) to what you're actually shredding",
    "explanation": "The P-rating (P-2 through P-7) describes the physical size and shape of the shredded particles, not how good the shredder feels, P-2 strip-cut produces long strips that are technically reconstructible, P-4 cross-cut produces confetti-sized pieces suitable for most personal and financial documents, and P-5 or higher micro-cut produces particles small enough for genuinely sensitive material.\n\nThis matters directly for documents with account numbers, social security numbers, or other identity-theft-relevant information, where strip-cut offers meaningfully weaker protection than cross-cut or micro-cut.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific P-rating number, not just the marketing terms \"cross-cut\" or \"micro-cut\" alone, since those terms can be applied loosely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check continuous run time against your actual shredding sessions",
    "explanation": "Every shredder has a maximum continuous run time before its motor needs to cool down, often just 2-5 minutes on budget models, after which it locks out for 15-30 minutes or longer while the motor cools.\n\nThis matters a great deal if you regularly shred a large stack in one sitting, hitting the run-time limit mid-task means stopping and waiting, sometimes repeatedly, before finishing the job.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for continuous run time in minutes, and compare that against how large your typical shredding sessions actually are, not just how often you shred."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider bin capacity relative to how often you're willing to empty it",
    "explanation": "A larger waste bin means fewer interruptions to empty it, but it also means a heavier bin to lift and empty when it does fill, and a shredder placed in a tight space under a desk may not have room for an oversized bin at all.\n\nBin size ranges widely across this category, from compact under-desk units around 3-4 gallons to larger office units at 6 gallons or more.\n\nCheck the listed bin capacity in gallons, and weigh it against both your available floor space and how often you're realistically willing to stop and empty it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify jam-clearing and safety features if this will see frequent or shared use",
    "explanation": "Features like anti-jam reverse function, overload sensors, and a safety lock that disables the blades when the bin is removed vary meaningfully between models at similar prices, and their absence turns an occasional paper jam into a genuine hassle involving manual disassembly.\n\nThis matters more for a shredder used frequently or by multiple people in a shared office setting than for occasional light personal use.\n\nCheck the specific listed safety and anti-jam features rather than assuming any shredder in this price range includes them, since budget models frequently omit auto-reverse or safety locks entirely."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Can a 10-sheet shredder really handle 10 sheets of any paper?", a: "Not reliably. Real-world capacity with mixed paper weights is typically closer to 7-8 sheets, the same 25-30% reduction pattern seen at lower capacity tiers, scaled up from the ideal lab-condition rating." },
  { q: "Why do two 10-sheet shredders have such different prices?", a: "Security level varies widely at this capacity tier. This guide's picks range from P-2 strip-cut ($34) to P-4 micro-cut ($59), a real security difference behind similarly-labeled capacity, not just brand markup." },
  { q: "Does more sheet capacity mean a longer continuous run time?", a: "Not proportionally. A 10-sheet shredder's run time is often similar to an 8-sheet model's (4-5 minutes) since the limiting factor is motor thermal capacity, not the sheet-handling spec itself." },
  { q: "Should I get a 10-sheet or 12-15 sheet shredder?", a: "Depends on your budget and how close to the rated capacity you typically shred. If you regularly approach 10 sheets, a 12-15 sheet-rated model gives more real-world headroom for the same reason the rated number exceeds actual mixed-paper performance." },
