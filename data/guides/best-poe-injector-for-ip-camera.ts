export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A First-Party Brand-Specific Injector Removes Compatibility Guesswork for That Specific Camera Ecosystem",
    "explanation": "An injector built and sold by the same company that makes your camera, like Reolink's own Gigabit injector for its PoE camera lineup, has been validated specifically against that brand's power negotiation behavior, while a generic third-party injector should work with any standard 802.3af/at camera but occasionally surfaces brand-specific quirks. This matters more if you've had a prior compatibility issue with a generic injector and a specific camera brand, and matters less if you're comfortable troubleshooting a generic unit. Consider a first-party injector specifically when one exists for your camera brand and removing that variable is worth a modest price premium."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Combining Two Cameras Onto One Cable Run Requires a Genuinely Different Product Than a Standard Injector",
    "explanation": "A standard PoE injector powers exactly one device per cable run, while a combiner-splitter kit specifically merges the signal and power for two separate cameras onto a single shared cable back to the switch, then splits them apart again near the camera locations, a real installation-cost saver when two cameras sit physically close together. This matters significantly if you're installing two cameras at the same corner of a building or room and want to avoid running two separate long cables, and matters not at all if your cameras are spread across different areas of a property. Confirm your specific camera placement layout before choosing a combiner kit over standard individual injectors."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bulk Multi-Camera Kits Deliver a Much Lower Per-Unit Cost but Typically Sacrifice Speed and Standard Negotiation",
    "explanation": "A bulk kit of 5 or more passive injector-splitter pairs can cost roughly $2 per pair, dramatically less than buying 5 individual standard injectors, but this cost saving typically comes with a tradeoff to 10Mbps-only speed and passive power delivery without the safety negotiation of 802.3af/at standard PoE. This matters significantly for an installer working on a large multi-camera job with standard-definition cameras where the speed tradeoff is irrelevant, and matters much less for a single high-resolution 4K camera that genuinely needs Gigabit throughput. Match the bulk kit's speed and power delivery limitations against your specific cameras' actual requirements before buying in volume."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP Rating on Just One Component of a Kit Doesn't Mean the Entire Kit Is Outdoor-Rated",
    "explanation": "A combiner-splitter kit may state an IP68 rating specifically on its receiver splitter unit, the component actually exposed to weather near the camera, while the sender combiner unit that stays indoors near your switch has no such rating and shouldn't be installed outdoors. This matters because assuming an entire kit shares one uniform weatherproofing rating could lead you to install an indoor-only component outdoors by mistake. Check which specific component of a multi-part kit carries the outdoor rating before planning your installation locations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Passive PoE in a Budget Kit Requires You to Separately Match Your Device's Exact Voltage",
    "explanation": "A budget passive injector, like the PoE Texas Mode B pick, passes through whatever voltage you supply it rather than negotiating the correct voltage automatically, meaning you must separately purchase a power adapter matching your specific camera's voltage requirement, unlike a standard 802.3af/at injector that handles this automatically. This matters if you're not confident about matching voltage specifications correctly, where a standard negotiated injector removes that risk, and matters less if you already know your camera's exact voltage requirement and have a compatible adapter. Check whether a budget passive option requires a separately purchased, voltage-matched power adapter before assuming the low sticker price is the complete cost."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a brand-specific PoE injector for my security camera?", "a": "Not necessarily; most IP cameras work with any standard 802.3af/at PoE injector, but a first-party injector from your camera's manufacturer removes any small compatibility uncertainty a generic unit might introduce." },
  { "q": "When does a two-camera combiner kit make sense over two separate injectors?", "a": "Specifically when two cameras are installed near each other and you want to avoid running two separate long cables back to your switch or NVR, saving real cabling cost and installation time." },
  { "q": "Is a bulk passive injector kit good enough for a 4K security camera?", "a": "No, bulk passive kits are typically limited to 10Mbps speed, which will bottleneck a high-resolution 4K camera; use a Gigabit-rated injector for higher-resolution cameras instead." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake when installing a PoE injector for a camera?", "a": "Assuming a passive PoE injector's voltage automatically matches your camera's requirement, when in fact you must separately confirm and supply a compatible power adapter at the correct voltage for a passive setup." },
  { "q": "Can I use a two-camera combiner kit outdoors?", "a": "Check which specific component is IP-rated; typically only the receiver splitter unit near the cameras is weatherproof, while the sender combiner unit near your switch should stay indoors." },
  { "q": "How much does a bulk multi-camera injector kit typically save compared to individual injectors?", "a": "A 5-pair bulk kit can cost roughly $2 per pair compared to $10-25 for a single standard injector, a significant saving for an installer working on multiple standard-definition cameras at once." }
