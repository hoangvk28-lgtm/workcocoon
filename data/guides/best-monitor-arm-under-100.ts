  {
    q: "Do I need a monitor arm for a standing desk?",
    a: "Yes for meaningful use. When you raise a standing desk from sitting to standing height (typically 15-20 inches), a fixed monitor stand moves with the desk but the monitor position does not adjust to maintain eye-level ergonomics. A monitor arm with a 50+ degree tilt range lets you set the monitor angle correctly at both heights without readjusting.",
  },
  {
    q: "What VESA size do I need?",
    a: "Most monitors use 100x100mm VESA - check your monitor's spec sheet or the back panel. Ultrawide monitors occasionally use 200x100mm, which requires verifying arm compatibility. Standard budget arms in this guide support 75x75 and 100x100mm. The VIVO V101G1 for heavy ultrawides supports up to 100x100mm.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a monitor arm work on an IKEA desk?",
    a: "Yes. IKEA LINNMON tops are 1.5 inches thick - within the 0.4-3.9 inch range of standard C-clamps. For IKEA LACK or other hollow-core tops, use the grommet mount option (passes through a pre-drilled hole) to distribute weight more safely than a surface clamp.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Amazon Basics arm the same as the Ergotron LX?",
    a: "The OEM mechanism is widely reported to be identical - same smooth gas spring, same cable channel, same aluminum construction. The practical difference is warranty: Ergotron offers a 15-year warranty, Amazon Basics offers standard Amazon return policy. At $65-99 vs $140-180, the Amazon Basics is the value choice if warranty is not a priority.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a monitor arm work with an ultrawide?",
    a: 'Yes, with capacity matching. Standard budget arms (HUANUO, North Bayou, V001) support 29-inch ultrawides under 22 lbs. For 34-inch ultrawides, use the VIVO V001 (38", 22 lbs) or the VIVO V101G1 (49", 33 lbs). Always verify your monitor\'s weight and VESA pattern before ordering.',
