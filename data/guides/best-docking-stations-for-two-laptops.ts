The all-in-one route is simpler to cable up, while the dock-plus-switch route usually keeps the full spec sheet, 100W PD, 4K120Hz, faster Ethernet, that a combined KVM dock often trims to fit its switching logic into one box.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "What's the difference between an all-in-one KVM dock and a standard dock with a separate KVM switch?",
    a: "An all-in-one KVM dock, like the AV Access picks in this list, combines switching and docking in one box, simpler cabling but usually with trimmed PD, port count, or display bandwidth compared to a full single-host dock. A standard dock, like the Anker Prime 14-Port, paired with a separate KVM switch keeps the complete spec sheet on each laptop at the cost of an extra device and more cables.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my gaming keyboard work with a KVM switch's hotkey?",
    a: "Not reliably. KVM hotkey switching depends on standard HID keyboard behavior, and gaming keyboards with custom firmware or macro software layers can fail to trigger the hotkey silently. Keep a basic wired USB keyboard nearby as a fallback if your primary keyboard has custom firmware.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a KVM dock charge both laptops at full power at the same time?",
    a: "It depends on the model. Some KVM docks, like the AV Access Docking Station KVM Switch in this list, rate 100W PD to each laptop. Others split power unevenly, giving full charging speed only to the active host and a slower trickle charge to the idle one. Check the specific PD spec rather than assuming symmetric charging.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do all USB devices switch automatically with a KVM dock?",
    a: "Keyboard and mouse typically switch cleanly since that's the core KVM function, but USB storage devices, webcams, and audio interfaces may need a few seconds to reinitialize after a switch. If your workflow depends on an always-on webcam, test the specific dock's peripheral behavior before relying on it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a KVM dock between a Mac and a Windows laptop?",
    a: "Yes, but expect some manual display reconfiguration on the Mac side. macOS does not automatically restore display arrangement and input device settings after a KVM switch the way some Windows setups can. The Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Dock for M4/M5 MacBook in this list is built specifically for the Mac side of a mixed pairing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick in this list is best for a laptop-and-desktop combo instead of two laptops?",
    a: "The AV Access 8K KVM Switch 2 Monitors 2 Computers is built for exactly this scenario, switching between a laptop and a desktop tower sharing one monitor and one set of peripherals, rather than being limited to two laptops.",
