  "A Gigabit-rated PoE extender should deliver a full 1000Mbps rather than the 100Mbps Fast Ethernet speed found on cheaper extenders, but whether that full Gigabit speed actually holds at the extender's maximum rated distance, or only over a shorter range, is worth checking before assuming any 'Gigabit' label guarantees consistent top speed.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 'Gigabit' Label Doesn't Guarantee Full 1000Mbps Speed at Every Port or Distance",
    "explanation": "The picks in this comparison specifically document full 1000Mbps across their rated distance and port count, but not every extender marketed as 'Gigabit' maintains that speed consistently, since some drop to a lower speed at extended distance or on secondary ports even while carrying a Gigabit label on the packaging. This matters significantly if you're connecting bandwidth-sensitive devices like 4K cameras that genuinely benefit from full Gigabit throughput, and matters less for lower-bandwidth devices like basic IP phones. Check a listing's specific speed claims per port and per distance, not just its headline 'Gigabit' label, before assuming full 1000Mbps holds throughout your actual installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dedicated High-Wattage Port Can Maintain Full Gigabit Speed While Still Supporting a Higher-Power Device",
    "explanation": "The Davuaz pick specifically maintains full 1000Mbps across all four of its output ports while also providing a dedicated 60W port for higher-power devices, showing that Gigabit speed and high-wattage support aren't mutually exclusive features on a well-designed extender. This matters if you need both full bandwidth and higher power for at least one connected device, like a PTZ camera that also streams high-resolution video, and matters less if your devices have modest power and bandwidth needs across the board. Check whether a Gigabit extender's higher-wattage port specifically maintains the same Gigabit speed as its standard ports, rather than assuming a power boost necessarily comes with a speed tradeoff."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Warranty Length Difference of Several Years Reflects Real Manufacturer Confidence, Not Just Price Positioning",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet pick's specifically stated 3-year Manufacturer Protection meaningfully exceeds the roughly 1-year warranty typical of budget-oriented Gigabit extenders like the VIMIN or Davuaz picks, a real difference in how long you're covered for a device you may run continuously for years. This matters if you're installing a Gigabit extender as long-term infrastructure and want assurance beyond the first year, and matters less if you're comfortable replacing inexpensive hardware without pursuing a warranty claim. Compare warranty length specifically against your expected years of continuous use, not just the upfront price difference between extenders."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Powering Multiple Devices From One Gigabit Extender Delivers More Value Per Dollar Than Multiple Single-Port Units",
    "explanation": "The VIMIN pick specifically powers three separate devices at full Gigabit speed from a single input unit, meaningfully more cost-effective per device than using three separate single-port Gigabit extenders like the TRENDnet pick to achieve the same coverage. This matters if you have multiple nearby devices needing Gigabit-speed PoE extension, and matters less if you only have one device that needs extending, where a single-port extender's other features (like warranty or NDAA compliance) might matter more than raw device count. Count your actual number of devices needing Gigabit-speed extension before choosing between a multi-port extender and several single-port units."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A True Zero-Local-Power Design Draws Its Entire Power Budget From the Upstream PoE Source Even at Full Gigabit Speed",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit PoE Passthrough Switch pick specifically confirms it requires no AC power supply while still maintaining full Gigabit speed, meaning its entire power budget, for both its own operation and for powering connected devices, comes exclusively from the upstream PoE source through the incoming cable. This matters if you're installing in a location with no nearby electrical outlet and still need full Gigabit throughput, and matters less if a local power connection is readily available and speed at the absolute lowest cost is your priority. Check whether a Gigabit-rated passthrough extender specifically confirms zero local power requirement, rather than assuming any Gigabit-speed device draws only from PoE."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a Gigabit PoE extender always deliver full 1000Mbps at its maximum rated distance?", "a": "Generally yes for the picks in this comparison, but it's not universal across all Gigabit-labeled extenders, so checking a listing's specific speed claims at your actual planned distance is worth doing rather than assuming any 'Gigabit' label guarantees full speed throughout." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Gigabit PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming a 'Gigabit' label alone guarantees full 1000Mbps across every port and at every distance, when speed and port-specific capability can vary between extenders that both carry the same general Gigabit marketing label." },
  { "q": "Is the TRENDnet extender worth the higher price over the VIMIN pick?", "a": "If you specifically want the longest warranty coverage and NDAA compliance for institutional use, the TRENDnet's higher price is justified, but for a standard home installation needing to power multiple devices, the VIMIN pick's lower price and multi-device support likely offer better value." },
  { "q": "Can I power a PTZ camera at full Gigabit speed with any of these extenders?", "a": "The Davuaz pick specifically maintains full Gigabit speed on its dedicated 60W port, making it the strongest choice in this comparison for powering a higher-wattage PTZ camera without sacrificing bandwidth." },
  { "q": "Do I need a local power outlet for any of these Gigabit PoE extenders?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison draw their power directly from the upstream PoE source, though the Gigabit PoE Passthrough Switch specifically emphasizes this zero-local-power design as a key feature." },
  { "q": "How many devices can I power from a single Gigabit PoE extender?", "a": "It varies by pick; the VIMIN and Gigabit PoE Passthrough Switch both power up to three devices from one unit at full Gigabit speed, while the TRENDnet extender is a single-port design intended for one device per unit." }
