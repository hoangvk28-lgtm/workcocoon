export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In PCIe Expansion Can Support More Than Just Storage, Adding Real Future Flexibility for a Creator's Toolkit",
    "explanation": "The HyperDrive Next pick specifically states its M.2 PCIe Gen 4x4 and Gen 3 slot supports both high-capacity NVMe SSDs and compatible PCIe-based modules like AI accelerators, a genuinely more flexible expansion path than a storage-only NVMe bay that can only ever hold a drive. This matters if you anticipate wanting to add specialized PCIe hardware like an AI accelerator for upscaling or generative tools down the line, and matters less if you only ever plan to use the slot for standard storage. Check whether a dock's expansion slot is described as storage-only or as a more flexible PCIe slot supporting other module types, if future hardware flexibility matters to your creative workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual Independent USB Controllers Prevent Bottlenecks When Offloading From Multiple Storage Devices Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The CalDigit TS5 Plus pick's Dual USB Controllers give front and rear ports their own dedicated 10Gb/s bandwidth, meaning connecting multiple high-speed drives to different ports doesn't force them to compete for the same shared bandwidth pool the way a single-controller dock would. This matters significantly if you regularly offload footage from multiple cards or drives at once, a common creator workflow after a shoot, and matters less if you typically connect only one storage device at a time. Check whether a dock specifically names independent or dual USB controllers if you plan to run multiple simultaneous high-speed transfers rather than one at a time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In UHS-II Card Readers Save Real Time Over a Separate USB Card Reader During Footage Offload",
    "explanation": "Both the CalDigit TS5 Plus and Cable Matters picks specifically include built-in SD and microSD readers rated for UHS-II speeds, letting you offload footage directly from a camera's memory card without needing a separate card reader accessory taking up another port. This matters if you regularly shoot with SD or microSD-based cameras and want a streamlined single-dock workflow, and matters less if your cameras primarily use CFexpress or another card format not covered by a UHS-II SD reader. Check whether a dock's built-in card reader specifically matches your camera's actual memory card format and speed class before assuming it covers your footage offload needs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thunderbolt Share Enables Direct PC-to-PC Collaboration Without Setting Up a Network Share",
    "explanation": "The HyperDrive Next and Cable Matters picks both specifically include Thunderbolt Share, letting two computers share files, storage, and control directly over the Thunderbolt connection without configuring a network share or transferring files through cloud storage first. This matters if you regularly collaborate with a co-editor or hand off project files between two workstations in the same room, and matters less if you work independently or already have an established network-based file sharing workflow. Check whether a dock specifically names Thunderbolt Share support if direct two-computer collaboration is part of your actual production process."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless Cooling Trades a Small Amount of Sustained Thermal Headroom for Genuinely Silent Operation",
    "explanation": "The Keychron pick's fanless all-aluminum design with an internal heat spreader keeps operation completely silent, a real benefit for a creator recording audio or working in a quiet studio environment where any fan noise could be picked up by a microphone or simply become distracting. This matters significantly if you record audio alongside video or work in a sound-sensitive environment, and matters less if you're doing silent editing work where ambient dock noise wouldn't be captured or noticed. Weigh a fanless design's silent operation against a larger actively-cooled dock's potentially greater sustained performance headroom based on whether your actual workflow involves audio capture."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a dock with built-in storage expansion as a creator, or can I use external drives instead?", "a": "Either approach works; built-in NVMe expansion like on the HyperDrive Next pick saves a port and reduces cable clutter, while external drives connected to a dock with more total ports, like the CalDigit TS5 Plus, offer more flexibility to swap storage as needed." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake creators make when choosing a Thunderbolt 5 dock?", "a": "Assuming any dock's headline bandwidth figure holds up when running simultaneous display output and file transfer, when actual sustained performance under real combined creative workloads can vary meaningfully between docks." },
  { "q": "Is the CalDigit TS5 Plus worth the price over the Cable Matters pick for a beginner creator?", "a": "If you're just starting out and don't need maximum port count or dual USB controllers, the Cable Matters pick's lower price and included UHS-II card readers likely cover your needs well, with the CalDigit's higher price better justified once your workflow grows more demanding." },
  { "q": "Will Thunderbolt Share work between a Mac and a Windows PC?", "a": "The Cable Matters listing specifically states Thunderbolt Share works on Windows 11, so a Mac-to-Windows Thunderbolt Share collaboration setup may not be supported the same way; checking each dock's specific platform requirements for this feature is worth doing before relying on it." },
  { "q": "Does a fanless dock like the Keychron overheat during long editing sessions?", "a": "The Keychron listing specifically describes elevated side panels, a through-vent grille, and an internal heat spreader engineered to maintain stability during continuous Thunderbolt 5 transfers and high-speed storage access, though as with any fanless design, extremely sustained maximum load has somewhat less thermal headroom than active cooling." },
  { "q": "Can I add an AI accelerator module to any of these docks for AI-assisted editing tools?", "a": "Only the HyperDrive Next in this comparison specifically supports PCIe-based modules like AI accelerators in its expansion slot, alongside standard NVMe storage, making it the strongest choice if you specifically want that future expansion path." }
