export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What 'Portable' Actually Means for This Machine",
    "explanation": "Portable engravers in this category range from genuinely handheld units that engrave objects in place, to lightweight fixed-bed machines under 2kg, to larger enclosed machines that are portable only in the sense of being movable between rooms. Check the actual weight, folded dimensions, and whether the object goes inside the machine or the machine works on the object, since these are very different use cases sharing the same marketing term."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Setup Time Each Time It's Relocated",
    "explanation": "A machine that needs re-leveling, refocusing, or recalibration every time it's set up in a new location adds real friction to genuinely portable use, even if its resting weight is low. Preassembled or plug-and-play designs, and machines with auto-focus, save meaningfully more time over repeated relocations than a machine that's light but fiddly to recalibrate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Power Source: Wall Outlet vs Battery",
    "explanation": "Nearly all machines in this category still require a constant wall outlet despite being called portable; only a genuinely battery-powered unit can run away from a fixed power source, which matters specifically for field or job-site marking work. Confirm this explicitly rather than assuming a lightweight machine is also cordless."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bed Size vs Handheld Flexibility",
    "explanation": "A fixed bed constrains the object to the machine's working area, while a handheld or rotary-equipped design can reach objects too large or irregularly shaped to fit inside any bed. Decide which limitation matters more for actual planned projects, since handheld capability adds real cost over an equivalent fixed-bed machine."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Safety Hardware for Repeated Moves",
    "explanation": "A machine used in different rooms, workshops, or job sites benefits from tilt detection and enclosure sensors that a permanently fixed machine may not need as urgently, since setup surfaces and surrounding conditions vary each time it's moved. Password locks also matter more for machines used in shared or semi-public spaces than for one fixed permanently in a private home shop."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What makes a laser engraver actually portable versus just small?",
    "a": "Genuine portability combines low weight (under roughly 2-3kg), minimal or no setup each time it's relocated, and ideally a phone app or touchscreen that removes the need for a connected laptop; a small machine that still needs recalibration and a laptop every time isn't meaningfully more portable than a larger fixed one."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a portable laser engraver run without a wall outlet?",
    "a": "Most cannot; the majority of portable and mini laser engravers still require a constant AC power connection despite their small size. Only battery-powered units, a smaller subset built specifically for field use, can run away from an outlet."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a handheld laser engraver as accurate as a fixed-bed machine?",
    "a": "A quality handheld galvo-based unit can match or exceed fixed-bed diode accuracy on flat surfaces, since galvo scanning doesn't rely on a moving gantry, but handheld use adds more operator-dependent variables like steady positioning that a fixed bed removes entirely."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do portable laser engravers need the same ventilation as full-size machines?",
    "a": "Yes. Portable size doesn't change the smoke and particulate produced during cutting or heavy engraving; any portable machine still needs to be run in a ventilated space or with an external air purifier, regardless of its enclosure."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much bed size do I lose by choosing a portable engraver?",
    "a": "Most portable and mini engravers in this category have beds between 80mm and 200mm per side, noticeably smaller than the 300-400mm beds common on full-size open-frame machines, so portable models generally suit small crafts, coasters, and jewelry rather than large sign blanks."
