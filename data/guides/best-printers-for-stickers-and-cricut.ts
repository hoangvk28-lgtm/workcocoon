  "We need to be upfront about what this list actually is before you buy: every printer here is a direct thermal 4x6 label printer, the same category used for shipping labels, not a printer marketed specifically for Cricut print-then-cut projects or full-color craft stickers. Direct thermal printers print in black only, using heat on treated label paper, with no ink or toner and no color capability at all.",
  "That means these picks fit a specific slice of the sticker and craft world well: plain black-and-white or single-color adhesive labels, organizational stickers, and simple die-cut shapes that Cricut can cut around, printed fast and cheaply. If your Cricut project needs a full-color printed image before cutting, which is what most people mean by Cricut's print-then-cut feature, you'll want a color inkjet printer and sticker paper instead, not any of the 8 printers below. We call out which picks handle registration accuracy and label stock best for the plain-sticker use case these printers actually support.",

    "explanation": "Listings for a printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "Has registration mark accuracy for Cricut print-then-cut been tested on these printers?",
    a: "No, we have not independently verified print-then-cut registration accuracy on any of these picks, since they're not built or marketed for that specific Cricut workflow. If precise alignment matters for your project, a standard color inkjet is the better-supported route.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the actual use case for these printers in a craft workflow?",
    a: "They're best suited to plain black text, barcode, or outline stickers, organizational labels, and simple die-cut shapes that Cricut can cut around. The MUNBYN 941BP's higher 300 DPI resolution is a genuine advantage for crisper black line art among these picks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get colored stickers without a color printer?",
    a: "Partially. The Phomemo 241BT is compatible with pre-colored thermal label stock, like pink labels, which gives you a colored background without the printer itself doing any color printing. The printed text or design is still black only.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need waterproof ink for outdoor stickers with these printers?",
    a: "That question doesn't apply here, these are direct thermal printers with no ink at all. For waterproof, sun-resistant color stickers you'd need a color inkjet with pigment ink and dedicated outdoor sticker paper, a separate purchase from anything in this list.",
