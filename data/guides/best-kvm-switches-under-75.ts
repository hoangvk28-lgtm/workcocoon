  "We compared this lineup on whether USB-C support actually includes laptop charging or just video and data, brand reliability and stated compatibility testing, and how many USB 3.0 ports each switch provides, since these details separate a switch that fits a modern two-laptop desk from one built only for older HDMI-only desktops."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C Support on a KVM Switch Doesn't Automatically Mean Laptop Charging",
    "explanation": "A KVM switch can accept a USB-C laptop input purely for video and data transfer without providing any power back to the laptop, meaning your laptop's battery still depends entirely on its own separate charger. Only switches that explicitly state Power Delivery wattage, like the MT-VIKI pick's 65W support in this comparison, actually charge the connected laptop through the same cable, so check for this specific claim rather than assuming any USB-C KVM switch handles charging."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "MacBooks Often Get Mirrored Displays Instead of Extended Ones on USB-C KVM Switches",
    "explanation": "Due to how macOS handles external displays through certain USB-C KVM switch configurations, several listings in this comparison explicitly note that MacBook users will see the same content mirrored across both monitors rather than being able to extend their desktop across two different screens, a limitation that doesn't affect compatible Windows or Linux laptops on the same hardware. If dual extended displays specifically matter to you and you use a MacBook, verify this limitation doesn't apply to your specific model before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Established Brand's Track Record Is Worth Something, Even at a Modest Price Premium",
    "explanation": "IOGEAR has produced KVM switches for years with a more established reputation than many of the newer generic brands that dominate budget listings in this category, and this history often translates to more predictable long-term reliability and support, even when the specific resolution or feature specs look more modest on paper. Weighing brand track record alongside raw specs is a reasonable approach specifically for a device like a KVM switch that you'll likely rely on daily for years."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Hybrid Input Design Solves a Specific, Common Setup Problem Better Than a Same-Connector-Only Switch",
    "explanation": "Many home offices actually combine one USB-C laptop (often a MacBook) with one traditional HDMI desktop PC, a mismatched pairing that a switch requiring the same connector type on both inputs, like the Cable Matters pick in this comparison, simply can't handle. If your own setup mixes connector types this way, a hybrid-input switch like the MT-VIKI pick is the more directly relevant solution, regardless of how impressive the other switch's specs look for a same-connector scenario."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Switch That Documents Its Own Limitations Clearly Is More Trustworthy Than One That Doesn't",
    "explanation": "The Cable Matters pick in this comparison explicitly lists what it doesn't do, no laptop charging, no EDID emulation, mirrored-only MacBook displays, directly in its own marketing rather than burying these details or omitting them entirely. A listing willing to clearly document its own limitations upfront is generally a stronger trust signal than one that only lists positive features and leaves buyers to discover constraints after purchase."

];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use the MT-VIKI hybrid switch with two HDMI desktops instead of a MacBook and desktop combo?", "a": "No, this specific model is designed for one USB-C input and one HDMI input simultaneously, so it wouldn't provide any advantage over a simpler HDMI-only switch if both your devices use HDMI; a dedicated 2-port HDMI switch would be a better and cheaper fit for that setup." },
  { "q": "Does the Cable Matters switch work with any USB-C laptop, or only specific brands?", "a": "It works with any laptop whose USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, commonly found on Thunderbolt 3, 4, or 5-compatible ports, rather than being limited to specific brands; check your laptop's own port specifications to confirm this support before buying." },
  { "q": "Is the IOGEAR switch's lower 1920x1200 resolution ceiling a real limitation for most users?", "a": "For general office work, web browsing, and document editing, 1920x1200 (close to standard 1080p) is perfectly sufficient, and this limitation mainly matters if you specifically need 4K resolution for detailed photo or video work." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my laptop's USB-C port actually supports the DisplayPort Alt Mode these switches require?", "a": "Check your laptop manufacturer's specification sheet for terms like \"DisplayPort Alt Mode,\" \"Thunderbolt 3/4/5,\" or explicit video-output support on the USB-C port; a USB-C port that only mentions charging and basic data transfer likely won't carry a video signal to these KVM switches." },
  { "q": "Will the 65W charging on the MT-VIKI switch fully charge a larger, power-hungry laptop?", "a": "65W is sufficient for most standard ultrabooks, but larger gaming or creator laptops that ship with a 90W or higher charger may charge more slowly or not keep pace with heavy usage when relying on this switch's 65W Power Delivery instead of their original charger." },
  { "q": "Can I mix and match the Hearvo switch's USB-A and USB-C ports for different peripherals at the same time?", "a": "Yes, its four USB 3.0 ports (3 USB-A, 1 USB-C) can be used simultaneously for different devices, like a USB-A keyboard, a USB-A mouse, and a USB-C flash drive, all connected and shared between the two computers at once." }
