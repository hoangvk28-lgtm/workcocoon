export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Independent Certification Programs Like Intel EVO Provide Real Third-Party Validation Beyond a Manufacturer's Own Claims",
    "explanation": "The WAVLINK pick's Intel EVO certification specifically requires passing Intel's own real-world performance, battery efficiency, and connectivity testing, a genuine independent validation process distinct from a manufacturer simply stating its own product performs well in marketing copy. This matters if you want objective assurance beyond a brand's self-reported specs, and matters less if you're already confident in a specific manufacturer's reputation from prior experience. Look for a named, verifiable certification program like Intel EVO rather than vague phrases like 'premium quality' or 'rigorously tested' with no independent body attached to the claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Platform-Specific Management Software Can Be a Genuine Differentiator for Business and IT-Managed Deployments",
    "explanation": "The Kensington pick's free DockWorks software is specifically built for Windows users to manage connection, performance, and security settings across deployed docks, a real business-IT feature that consumer-focused competitors in this comparison don't offer at all. This matters significantly if you're deploying docks across an organization and need centralized management or security configuration, and matters less for a single personal home office dock. Check whether a dock includes named management software specifically built for your deployment's operating system and scale, rather than assuming any dock will integrate equally well into an IT-managed environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Cheaper Alternative Isn't Automatically a Worse Choice if It Specifically Fits Your Actual Use Case",
    "explanation": "The WAVLINK pick's $199.99 price is meaningfully lower than the flagship docks it's positioned as an alternative to, yet it still delivers Intel EVO certification and 120Gbps Thunderbolt 5 speeds, showing that a lower price doesn't automatically mean a worse real-world fit for buyers who don't need a flagship's full port count or feature set. This matters if you're tempted to default to the most expensive, most-marketed option assuming it's always the safest choice, and matters less if your workflow genuinely requires a flagship's maximum port count and features. Match a dock's actual feature set to your real use case rather than assuming higher price always means better value for your specific situation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Sustainability Disclosures Are More Meaningful and Checkable Than General Eco-Marketing Claims",
    "explanation": "The Kensington pick's specifically named 100% post-consumer recycled aluminum casing and Forest Stewardship Council certified packaging are concrete, checkable claims, distinct from a vague 'eco-friendly' label that doesn't specify any particular material or certification standard. This matters if your purchase decision or corporate procurement process factors in sustainability credentials, and matters less if that isn't a consideration for your buying decision. Look for named materials, percentages, and recognized certification bodies in a product's sustainability claims, rather than accepting general environmental language with no specific, verifiable backing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Chip Apple Silicon Documentation Is a More Reliable Signal Than a Generic 'Mac Compatible' Claim",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick's specifically stated per-chip breakdown, dual 6K on Pro/Max models versus quad 4K only via daisy-chaining on M5 Max chips, reveals real, meaningful differences in display capability across Apple's current lineup that a generic 'Mac compatible' label on a competing alternative doesn't convey at all. This matters significantly if you're choosing a dock specifically to maximize your exact Mac chip's display potential, and matters less if any single external display comfortably meets your needs. Look for a dock listing that specifically names your exact Mac chip tier's display limits rather than accepting a generic Mac compatibility claim that doesn't specify which chip generation was actually tested."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a cheaper alternative to a flagship Thunderbolt 5 dock always a worse choice?", "a": "Not necessarily; the WAVLINK Intel EVO Certified pick in this comparison costs significantly less than flagship docks while still delivering genuine 120Gbps speeds and independent certification, making it a strong fit for buyers who don't need a flagship's maximum port count." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when looking for a Thunderbolt 5 dock alternative?", "a": "Assuming the most expensive, most heavily marketed dock is automatically the right choice for every use case, when a platform-specific or budget-conscious alternative often better matches an individual buyer's actual real-world needs." },
  { "q": "Is the Kensington SD5010T5's DockWorks software useful for a home office, or only for businesses?", "a": "While DockWorks is specifically built with business IT management in mind, a home office user on Windows can still benefit from its connection, performance, and security management features, though the business-fleet-management aspects won't be as relevant." },
  { "q": "Does Intel EVO certification really mean better real-world performance than an uncertified dock?", "a": "Intel EVO certification specifically requires passing independent real-world performance, battery efficiency, and connectivity testing, which is a genuine assurance signal, though an uncertified dock from a reputable manufacturer can still perform well without pursuing that specific certification." },
  { "q": "Which alternative is best if I switch between a Mac and a Windows laptop regularly?", "a": "The StarTech Thunderbolt 5 Universal Docking Station's driverless design specifically works consistently across both macOS and Windows, making it the strongest alternative in this comparison for a genuinely mixed-platform setup." },
  { "q": "Can I use the UGREEN budget alternative for a demanding multi-display professional workflow?", "a": "The UGREEN pick supports up to triple 4K@144Hz displays on a Windows Thunderbolt 5 host or Mac with an M5 Pro/Max chip, which handles many demanding workflows well, though its dynamically allocated 140W charging means very heavy simultaneous device use could reduce available laptop charging power compared to a flagship dock's sustained power delivery." }
