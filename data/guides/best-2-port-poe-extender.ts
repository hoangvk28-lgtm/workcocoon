export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Toggle Switch Between Distance Modes Trades Real Bandwidth for Real Extra Reach",
    "explanation": "The REVODATA pick's specifically documented toggle switch offers 100m at 100Mbps or 250m at a reduced 10Mbps, a genuine and substantial bandwidth tradeoff for doubling the transmission distance, rather than a marketing gimmick with no real performance cost. This matters significantly if you need the extra 150 meters of reach but are connecting a bandwidth-sensitive device, since 10Mbps may not support smooth video from a higher-resolution camera. Check whether an extended-distance mode's exact bandwidth reduction is documented, and confirm your specific device's actual bandwidth needs before choosing an extended mode over a shorter but faster standard connection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Port Wattage Limits Can Differ Between the Two Ports on the Same 2-Port Extender",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically documents an 8W limit on its camera port versus a 15W limit on its out port, a real asymmetry between the two ports on the identical physical device that a buyer might not expect if they assumed both ports shared the same power budget. This matters if you're connecting two different devices with meaningfully different power needs to the same 2-port extender, since assigning a higher-power device to the wrong port could result in insufficient power delivery. Check whether a 2-port extender's ports have identical or different wattage limits, and assign your specific devices to the appropriate port based on their actual power draw."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Extender Explicitly Limited to 48V PoE Devices May Not Work With Every PoE-Labeled Device You Own",
    "explanation": "The NICGIGA pick specifically states only 48V PoE devices are supported, an honest disclosure that helps you verify compatibility before assuming any device labeled 'PoE' will work, since some devices use a different voltage standard like 24V passive PoE that wouldn't be compatible. This matters significantly if you're not certain which PoE voltage standard your specific devices use, and matters less if you already know your devices use standard 48V or 53V active PoE. Verify your device's exact PoE voltage specification against an extender's explicitly stated compatibility, rather than assuming any 2-port PoE extender works with any PoE-branded device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Warranty and Documented Support Commitment Provide Real Recourse for a Low-Cost Device That's Easy to Overlook",
    "explanation": "The NICGIGA pick's specifically stated 1-year warranty, lifetime technical support, and unconditional 30-day return policy provide more comprehensive recourse than a bare-minimum warranty, which matters for a genuinely inexpensive device that's easy to write off as disposable if it fails, but where a failure could still mean a real device outage until replaced. This matters if you want assurance beyond just the purchase price for a device that, despite its low cost, plays a real role in your network's reliability, and matters less if you're comfortable simply replacing a failed unit without pursuing warranty support. Check a low-cost extender's specific warranty and support terms rather than assuming all similarly priced units offer the same level of backing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Unit Cascade Deployment Requires Connecting the Second Unit to the First Unit's Output Port Specifically",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's listing specifically notes that a second extender's PoE input must connect to the first extender's Out port, not its Camera port, a precise wiring detail that determines whether a cascade deployment actually reaches its documented maximum distance. This matters if you're planning a multi-unit cascade to reach the extender's full advertised total distance, since connecting units in the wrong order or to the wrong port could result in a non-functional or underperforming setup. Read a cascade deployment's specific port-to-port wiring instructions carefully before assuming any two ports on adjacent units can be connected interchangeably."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a 2-port PoE extender's extended distance mode still support smooth video from my camera?", "a": "It depends on the resolution; the REVODATA pick's extended 250m mode specifically drops to 10Mbps, which the listing itself recommends specifically for surveillance cameras rather than higher-bandwidth devices, so checking your camera's actual bitrate needs against that reduced speed is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 2-port PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming both ports on a 2-port extender share identical power limits, when some extenders, like the LINOVISION pick, specifically document different wattage limits on each individual port." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION pick worth the higher price over the VIMIN extender?", "a": "If you specifically need the longest total cascade distance with precise per-port wattage documentation, the LINOVISION's higher price is justified, but for a standard 100m two-device installation, the VIMIN's lower price and full Gigabit speed likely offer better value." },
  { "q": "Can I use these 2-port extenders with a 24V passive PoE camera?", "a": "The LINOVISION pick specifically states it does not support 24V PoE devices, and the NICGIGA pick specifically limits compatibility to 48V devices, so verifying your exact camera's PoE voltage standard against each listing's stated compatibility is important before buying." },
  { "q": "Do I need outdoor waterproofing if my 2-port extender will be installed in a garage or shed?", "a": "A garage or shed with some weather exposure but not full outdoor conditions may still benefit from an IP-rated extender like the VIMIN or REVODATA picks, since dust and humidity can affect unprotected electronics even in a partially sheltered space." },
  { "q": "How do I properly cascade two PoE extenders together to reach maximum distance?", "a": "The LINOVISION listing specifically instructs connecting the second extender's PoE input to the first extender's Out port rather than its Camera port, so following that exact wiring order is necessary to reach the documented maximum cascade distance." }
