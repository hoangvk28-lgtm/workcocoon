export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Measure your existing desk's height before ordering",
    "explanation": "A standing desk converter sits on top of your current desk and adds its own height on top of that, even at the converter's lowest seated setting, sometimes adding several inches before you've raised anything at all.\n\nThis matters because if your desk is already at a comfortable seated typing height, most gas-spring and electric converters can push your keyboard and monitor uncomfortably high the moment you set the converter down, forcing you into an awkward seated typing posture even when you never plan to stand.\n\nBefore ordering, check the listing for the converter's minimum or lowest platform height (not just its maximum standing height), measure your desk's current height, and add the two together to confirm the result still feels comfortable seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match platform size to your actual number of monitors",
    "explanation": "Platform size is usually listed in inches of width, and it directly determines how many monitors and how much keyboard and mouse space you'll realistically have once everything is set up.\n\nA platform in the mid-20s to high-20s of inches comfortably fits a single monitor or laptop, while dual monitors typically need at least 32 inches and three monitors usually need 42 inches or more with a dedicated multi-monitor mount, since monitors, a keyboard, and a mouse all need to coexist on the same riser surface without overhanging the edge.\n\nCheck the listing's stated platform width against the combined width of your actual monitors plus keyboard, not just the number of monitors the title claims to support."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh electric versus manual lift for how often you'll adjust it",
    "explanation": "A manual converter typically uses a gas-spring or counterbalance mechanism you push or pull to raise and lower, requiring no power and generally costing less, while an electric converter uses a motor and push-button control for smoother, more precise height changes at the cost of needing a nearby power outlet and a meaningfully higher price.\n\nIf you plan to switch between sitting and standing multiple times a day, the effortless one-touch adjustment of an electric lift genuinely reduces the friction that causes people to stop bothering with height changes altogether, while an occasional adjuster may not find that premium worth paying.\n\nCheck the listing for words like \"electric,\" \"motorized,\" or \"push-button\" versus \"gas spring\" or \"manual\" to confirm which mechanism you're buying, and if electric, confirm an outlet is within reach of where the desk sits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check your desk's depth against the converter's base footprint",
    "explanation": "A converter's base, the part that actually sits on your desk, is typically deeper front-to-back than the platform surface alone, since it needs room for the lifting mechanism and stability at full height, and larger platforms generally require a proportionally larger base.\n\nThis matters because a desk that's wide enough for the platform can still be too shallow for the base, leaving the converter's back edge hanging off the desk or blocking a monitor from sitting far enough back to be comfortable to view.\n\nCheck the listing's stated base or footprint dimensions, not just the platform width, and measure your desk's actual depth (front edge to back edge) before ordering rather than assuming platform width is the only number that matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating together, not separately",
    "explanation": "A star rating on its own only tells you the average sentiment, while the review count tells you how much data that average is actually built on, and a converter with a 4.8 rating from a few hundred reviews carries meaningfully less statistical confidence than one with a 4.6 rating built on tens of thousands of reviews.\n\nThis is a genuine buying trap: a newer or less popular converter can post a higher headline rating simply by chance or by early-adopter bias before enough reviews accumulate to reveal real long-term issues, while an older, heavily-reviewed model's slightly lower average often reflects a more complete picture of durability over time.\n\nWhen comparing two similarly priced converters, check both numbers side by side in the listing rather than sorting by star rating alone."
