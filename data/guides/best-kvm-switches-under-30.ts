  "Under $30, KVM switches share a common core design, an HDMI switch box that lets two computers share one monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but they differ in real ways: USB 2.0 versus USB 3.0 port speed, whether a wired remote lets you hide the switch away from your desk, and how reliably each one actually holds a stable 4K signal.",
  "We compared this lineup on stated USB transfer speeds, switching method flexibility, and specific compatibility notes each listing discloses, since a $30 KVM switch works fine for most desks, but the details that separate a good one from a frustrating one aren't always obvious from the headline spec."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB 2.0 vs USB 3.0 Isn't Just a Number, It's a Real Speed Difference for Storage Devices",
    "explanation": "USB 2.0 ports max out around 480Mbps of data transfer, while USB 3.0 ports reach up to 5Gbps, over ten times faster, a difference you'll genuinely notice if you regularly copy large files to or from a shared flash drive or external hard drive connected through the KVM switch. For a basic keyboard and mouse alone, this speed difference doesn't matter, but check the specific USB version stated in the listing if you plan to share storage devices between computers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Adaptive EDID Technology Solves a Common Flickering and Resolution Problem",
    "explanation": "EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is the information a monitor sends to a computer describing its supported resolutions and refresh rates, and when a KVM switch sits between the monitor and multiple computers, this data exchange can sometimes fail or produce a mismatch, causing flickering or a computer defaulting to a lower resolution than the monitor supports. A KVM switch with stated adaptive EDID technology handles this exchange more reliably, reducing these frustrating display issues compared to a switch without this feature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hotkey Switching Isn't Universal at This Price, Even When a Switch Has Other Convenient Features",
    "explanation": "Several listings in this comparison specifically state that keyboard hotkey switching (pressing a key combination to switch computers without touching the physical switch box) is not supported, even on picks with other conveniences like a wired remote or desktop controller. If keyboard-only switching without reaching for a separate button or remote matters to you, check this specific detail in the listing rather than assuming it's included just because other switching methods are."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A KVM Switch's HDMI Adapter Compatibility Warning Should Be Taken Seriously, Not as Generic Caution",
    "explanation": "Some listings, like one pick in this comparison, specifically warn that using HDMI adapters or conversion cables (for connecting devices with DisplayPort, USB-C, or other non-HDMI outputs) may cause unstable or flickering transmission, or the connection dropping out entirely. This is a specific, testable limitation rather than generic legal caution, so if your setup requires an adapter to reach HDMI, either choose a pick without this warning or budget for potential troubleshooting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included Cables Represent Real Cost Savings Worth Factoring Into Your Total Price Comparison",
    "explanation": "A KVM switch listed at a lower price but requiring you to separately buy two HDMI cables and USB cables can end up costing more in total than a slightly pricier pick that includes everything needed in the box. Before comparing listings by sticker price alone, check exactly what's included and factor in the cost of any cables you'd need to buy separately to get an honest total cost comparison."
  }

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use a USB-C to HDMI adapter with these KVM switches if my laptop doesn't have HDMI?", "a": "It depends on the specific switch; some listings in this comparison explicitly warn against using adapters or conversion cables, which can cause unstable transmission, while others don't mention this limitation. Check the specific listing's compatibility notes before assuming an adapter will work reliably." },
  { "q": "Do any of these budget KVM switches support keyboard hotkey switching?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison explicitly state they do not support keyboard hotkey switching, relying instead on a physical button, wired remote, or desktop controller to switch between computers." },
  { "q": "Is USB 3.0 necessary if I'm just sharing a keyboard and mouse between two computers?", "a": "No, a basic keyboard and mouse use minimal bandwidth well within USB 2.0 capability, so USB 3.0 mainly matters if you're also sharing storage devices, scanners, or other data-heavy USB peripherals between the two computers." },
  { "q": "Will these KVM switches work with gaming consoles like PS5 or Xbox in addition to computers?", "a": "Some picks in this comparison, like the 4K KVM Switch HDMI 2 Port Box, explicitly state compatibility with gaming consoles, TV boxes, and other HDMI source devices beyond just PCs, though always confirm this in the specific listing before assuming universal device compatibility." },
  { "q": "What does adaptive EDID technology actually fix in practice?", "a": "It reduces the chances of your monitor flickering, defaulting to a lower resolution than it supports, or failing to display properly when switching between the two connected computers, by more reliably communicating the monitor's actual capabilities to whichever computer is active." },
  { "q": "How do I know if a KVM switch at this price will support 4K resolution reliably?", "a": "All four picks in this comparison state support for 4K@60Hz, but check for any specific cable length or quality warnings in the listing, since some note that HDMI 2.0 standard cables under a certain length are required to maintain a stable 4K signal." }
