export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are budget cheap drawing tablets genuinely usable, or do they cut corners that matter?",
    "a": "It varies. Some budget tablets use simpler pen chips or fewer shortcut keys to hit a lower price while keeping comparable core hardware, so compare documented activation force and driver support rather than price alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "What should I check before buying the cheapest option available?",
    "a": "Verify included accessories, replacement nib availability, and current driver support, since these often separate genuinely comparable budget options from ones that cut real corners."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
