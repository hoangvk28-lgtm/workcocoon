// ─── Common mistakes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const mistakes = [
  {
    title: "Buying an arm for a non-VESA monitor",
    body: "Check the back of your monitor first. If there are no four-hole mounting points (75x75mm or 100x100mm), an arm won't attach without a separate VESA adapter ($10-$20). Budget monitors and all-in-ones like iMacs often need adapters.",
  },
  {
    title: "Clamping an arm to a weak desk",
    body: "Particle board desks (common IKEA models like LINNMON) can crack under arm clamp pressure with heavy monitors. If your desk feels flimsy, reinforce the clamp point with a steel plate ($5-$10) or use a stand instead.",
  },
  {
    title: "Forgetting cable length",
    body: "Monitor arms position the screen further from the desk edge. Your existing HDMI or DisplayPort cable may be too short. Budget for a 6-foot cable ($8-$12) when buying an arm.",
  },
  {
    title: "Over-spending on a stand",
    body: "The difference between a $20 stand and a $45 stand is usually storage drawers and USB ports - not monitor support quality. If you just need height, the $20 adjustable riser works fine.",
  },
  {
    title: "Ignoring monitor weight",
    body: "Every arm has a weight limit. A 27-inch monitor typically weighs 10-15 lbs. A 32-inch ultrawide can weigh 18-22 lbs. If your monitor exceeds the arm's limit, it will droop over time.",

];

// ─── FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const faq: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
  {
    q: "Is a monitor arm worth it?",
    a: "For most users spending 6+ hours daily at a desk, yes. The ergonomic benefits (proper height, depth, and tilt) reduce neck and eye strain that compounds over months. At $30-$45 for a budget arm, the cost is comparable to a decent keyboard - and the health impact is arguably larger. For casual users or those with large desks, a stand is perfectly fine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do monitor arms work with any monitor?",
    a: "Only monitors with VESA mounting holes (75x75mm or 100x100mm). Most monitors 24 inches and above have VESA holes, but check the back of your monitor or its spec sheet to confirm. Monitors without VESA holes need an adapter or are limited to stands.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are monitor arms worth it for gaming?",
    a: "Yes, particularly if you play competitive games where pulling the monitor closer helps reaction time, or if you use a secondary monitor in portrait mode for chat/streaming. The VIVO V001 ($32) is the most popular gaming arm under $50.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a monitor arm with a glass desk?",
    a: "Not with a standard clamp - the clamp pressure can crack glass. Use a freestanding monitor arm (sits on the desk with a weighted base) or a grommet mount (bolts through a hole in the desk). Both options cost $40-$60 and are less common at the budget end.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a monitor arm for a standing desk?",
    a: "Strongly recommended. A fixed stand can't adjust when you switch between sitting and standing - your monitor will be at the wrong height for one position. A gas spring arm ($35-$45) adjusts with one hand, making the transition seamless.",
  },
  {
    q: "Monitor arm vs monitor stand for dual monitors?",
    a: "Arms win decisively for dual setups. Two stands consume roughly 400 square inches of desk space. A dual arm uses one 9-square-inch clamp point. At $35-$45 for a budget dual arm, it's also cost-competitive with buying two separate stands.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the best monitor arm under $50?",
    a: "The VIVO V001 ($30-$38) is the most recommended budget arm across Reddit, YouTube, and buyer reviews. It supports monitors up to 32 inches (22 lbs), has full adjustment range, and includes cable management clips. For gas spring convenience, the HUANUO ($35-$45) is the upgrade pick.",
