  "A native HDMI port on a Thunderbolt 5 dock avoids the extra cost and potential bandwidth compromise of a separate USB-C to HDMI adapter, but whether a dock includes one HDMI port or two, and at what resolution ceiling, varies enough to matter for a real multi-monitor setup.",
  "We compared this lineup on exact HDMI port count and documented resolution ceiling per platform, since one listing specifically states its dual HDMI 2.1 ports reach 8K@60Hz on Thunderbolt 5 hosts but drop to 4K@120Hz on Thunderbolt 4 hosts using the identical hardware."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An HDMI Port's Real Resolution Ceiling Often Depends on Whether Your Host Is Thunderbolt 5 or Thunderbolt 4",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick specifically states its dual HDMI 2.1 ports reach up to 8K@60Hz or 4K@144Hz on a genuine Thunderbolt 5 host, but drop to dual 4K@120Hz on a Thunderbolt 4 host using the identical physical dock, a real and substantial difference tied entirely to your laptop's Thunderbolt generation rather than the dock itself changing. This matters significantly if you're specifically buying a dock to maximize HDMI resolution and own an older Thunderbolt 4 laptop, since the dock's best-case headline HDMI spec may simply not be achievable on your hardware. Check a dock's HDMI resolution specs broken down by exact host generation, not just its single best-case headline number, before assuming you'll get the top-tier resolution."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual Native HDMI Ports Let You Skip Adapters Entirely if Both Your Monitors Use HDMI",
    "explanation": "The Plugable and Kensington picks both specifically include two native HDMI ports, meaning two HDMI monitors can connect directly without needing any USB-C to HDMI adapter or DisplayPort-to-HDMI conversion, which can otherwise introduce a compatibility question or a mild bandwidth compromise. This matters significantly if your existing monitors are both HDMI-only, and matters less if one or more of your displays already uses DisplayPort or USB-C natively. Count your actual monitors' native input types before choosing a dock, and prioritize a dock with enough matching native ports for your exact setup instead of assuming any dock's total port count covers your specific monitor connection types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Included HDMI Cable Removes a Real, Easy-to-Overlook Additional Purchase",
    "explanation": "The Dell Pro Bundle specifically states its package includes a premium HDMI cable alongside USB-C and DisplayPort cables, an explicit inclusion that isn't guaranteed on every dock with HDMI output, since many listings confirm the port exists without confirming a compatible cable ships with it. This matters if you don't already own an HDMI cable rated for the resolution and refresh rate you actually need (a standard HDMI cable may not carry full 8K@60Hz bandwidth), since discovering this gap after purchase adds unplanned cost and delay. Check a dock's included-accessories list specifically for a named HDMI cable rated for your target resolution, rather than assuming a compatible cable is automatically included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Enterprise Fleet Management Features Add Real Value Only at Organizational Scale, Not for a Single Home Desk",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo pick's Accessories Fleet Manager, a cloud-based AWS-powered tool for remotely configuring, updating, and diagnosing docks, is a genuinely valuable feature for an IT department managing many HDMI-equipped desks across an organization, but delivers no practical benefit to a single home-office user with one dock. This matters if you're specifically deploying docks across a business or shared office, and matters much less for personal use, where the feature's added cost isn't offset by any real benefit. Weigh whether enterprise-oriented management features actually apply to your deployment scale before paying a premium for them."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Warranty on an HDMI Dock Provides Real Assurance Against a Failed Display Port Over Time",
    "explanation": "The Kensington pick's specifically stated 3-year limited warranty is the longest in this comparison, giving real recourse if an HDMI port or other component fails well after the typical 1-year warranty period many competing docks offer. This matters if you plan to keep a dock in daily use for several years and want protection against a hardware failure beyond the first year, and matters less if you tend to upgrade hardware more frequently. Compare warranty length specifically, not just price, when a dock will serve as permanent daily infrastructure for your HDMI-connected displays."

  { "q": "Is the Dell Pro Bundle worth the higher price if I already own an HDMI cable?", "a": "If you already have a compatible HDMI 2.1-rated cable, the Kensington or Plugable picks likely deliver better value at a lower price, but if you want a complete kit with no cable-shopping needed, the Dell bundle's inclusion justifies its higher price." },
  { "q": "Do I need a special HDMI cable to get full 8K@60Hz from these docks?", "a": "Yes, an HDMI cable specifically rated for HDMI 2.1 bandwidth is needed to carry a full 8K@60Hz signal; an older or lower-spec HDMI cable can bottleneck the signal even when connected to a compatible port." },
  { "q": "Can I use these HDMI-equipped docks for a business fleet deployment?", "a": "The Lenovo ThinkPad Thunderbolt 5 Smart Dock 7500 is specifically built with fleet-management features like remote configuration and diagnostics, making it the strongest choice in this comparison for a multi-desk business deployment." },
