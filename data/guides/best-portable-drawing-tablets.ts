Every purchase includes real creative software and access to Wacom's online training, a genuine value-add most budget tablets skip entirely.\n\nAs a screenless pen tablet, it maps to your existing monitor rather than adding a second display, keeping the setup simple and the price low. Wacom backs it with over 40 years in the category, which shows up in driver maturity and long-term software compatibility.",

The battery-free PN01 stylus needs no charging, and Chromebook support specifically covers Google Jamboard, Google Keep, and Google Canvas workflows.\n\nThis is a mouse-replacement tablet more than a professional illustration device, aimed at e-signatures, remote work, and light sketching rather than detailed digital art. It works across Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Zoom for annotation and note-taking use cases.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much smaller is the usable area on portable drawing tablets compared to full-size tablets?",
    "a": "Meaningfully smaller in most cases, so check the documented active area directly rather than assuming a compact chassis retains a full-size drawing surface."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a portable tablet worth it if I mostly draw at a fixed desk?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. If you don't need to travel with it, a larger fixed-desk tablet often gives more active area and features for a similar price."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
