export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Don't Assume the Priciest Pick Automatically Has the Best Specs",
    "explanation": "In this comparison, the S12 Triple Portable Monitor at $249.98 actually has higher stated brightness (350 nits) than the pricier $259.99 P7 pick (300 nits), because the S12's premium comes from its 1200P resolution and CNC aluminum build, not from brightness. Before assuming a higher price means better specs across the board, compare each individual figure, brightness, resolution, weight, separately rather than treating price as a single ranking signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Slightly Heavier Triple-Screen Setup Isn't Always the More Feature-Rich One",
    "explanation": "Weight differences between triple-screen extenders in this range come from panel size, frame material, and internal battery reserve, not necessarily from added features. A 3.9 lb setup and a 4 lb setup in this comparison offer essentially the same triple-screen capability, so weight alone shouldn't be read as a proxy for build quality or feature richness. Check the specific listed weight number and weigh it against your own portability needs rather than assuming lighter or heavier correlates with better."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Decide Between Brightness and Resolution Based on Your Actual Environment, Not Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "Higher brightness (measured in nits) matters more if you work near windows or in well-lit rooms where screen glare is a real problem, while higher resolution and a taller aspect ratio matter more for detail-dense work like coding or spreadsheets regardless of lighting. Both marketing terms sound like unconditional upgrades, but each solves a genuinely different problem, so identify which constraint actually affects your daily work before picking based on whichever number sounds bigger."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "At This Price Point, Compare the Cost of Three Different Tiers, Not Just Two",
    "explanation": "With a $300 ceiling, you have genuine choices spanning from a $110 single detachable panel through two different triple-screen options in the $190-260 range, meaning the honest comparison isn't just \"triple-screen or not\" but which specific triple-screen configuration, or whether a single panel, actually fits your budget and workflow best. Map out what each tier specifically adds over the one below it rather than defaulting to the most expensive option because it's within budget."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Carrying Case Included in the Box Is a Real Added Value at This Price",
    "explanation": "Some triple-screen extenders in this range explicitly include a padded or premium carrying case for transport, while others require buying one separately if you plan to move the setup between locations regularly. Given that a triple-screen rig is bulkier and more fragile to transport than a single panel, a listing that includes a dedicated case is providing real added value worth factoring into a price comparison, not just an afterthought accessory."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Which triple-screen pick in this guide has the best overall specs?", "a": "The S12 Triple Portable Monitor 16\" 1200P at $249.98 has the edge, combining higher resolution, a taller 16:10 aspect ratio, and higher stated brightness (350 nits) than the pricier P7 pick, making it the strongest all-around choice in this comparison." },
  { "q": "Is it worth paying $70 more for the P7's 300 nit brightness over the ZUMWALT's 280 nits?", "a": "For most buyers, no, since a 20 nit difference is a modest, often barely noticeable improvement. The larger, more relevant differences in this guide are between 1080P and 1200P resolution or between triple-screen and single-panel setups, not small brightness increments within the same resolution tier." },
  { "q": "Do all the triple-screen extenders in this guide need the same MacBook M-series workaround?", "a": "Yes, every triple-screen pick in this comparison that requires two full-featured USB-C ports for its simplest setup will need the additional H5-T cable, HDMI, and USB-A workaround for MacBook M1/M2/M3 models lacking that port configuration, since this is a hardware limitation shared across this product category, not specific to one brand." },
  { "q": "How do I decide between the 1200P S12 and the 300 nit P7 if I do both coding and video work?", "a": "If you had to choose one factor, resolution and aspect ratio generally matter more for coding specifically, since more vertical lines visible at once directly speeds up reading and navigating code, while the brightness difference between these two picks is small enough to matter less across both use cases." },
  { "q": "Can I use just one of the two panels in a triple-screen extender if I don't need both?", "a": "Most triple-screen kits are designed to run both panels together as part of the mounting mechanism, and using only one panel typically isn't a supported configuration since the frame is built around the laptop sitting between both screens. If you only want one extra screen, a dedicated single-panel detachable extender is the better purchase from the start." },
  { "q": "Does the included carrying case affect the overall weight I'll be carrying?", "a": "The case itself adds some weight beyond the extender's own stated figure, but it's generally a modest addition relative to the panels themselves, and the protection it provides during transport is usually worth the small extra weight if you move the setup between locations often." }
