  {
    "criterion": "DisplayLink Technology Explicitly Cannot Support Gaming or Protected Content Playback",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick's listing specifically and explicitly states it does not support gaming or protected content playback such as Netflix or Hulu, a real technical limitation of DisplayLink's software-based video compression approach, not a minor caveat buried in fine print. This matters significantly if you plan to game or stream video services through your external monitors connected to the dock, where a DisplayLink-based dock simply won't work for those use cases regardless of its other strengths, and matters less if you only use the dock for office productivity, web browsing, and document work. Check whether a dock's DisplayPort or HDMI output is powered by native GPU video or DisplayLink technology before assuming any dock with the right connector will support your intended gaming or streaming use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Not Every Dock Charges the Connected Host Laptop, Even When It Handles Display and Data Duties Well",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick's listing specifically discloses that this docking station does NOT charge the host computer, meaning you'll still need your laptop's original charger connected separately even while using the dock for displays and peripherals. This matters if you were hoping to consolidate to a single cable for both charging and display connectivity, where this dock's lack of charging capability would be a real limitation, and matters less if you're comfortable keeping your laptop's original charger plugged in alongside the dock. Check whether a dock specifically states host laptop charging capability rather than assuming any dock with a USB-C connection also charges your laptop."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Integrated, Non-Detachable Cable Trades Replaceability for a Guaranteed Cable Quality Match",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo pick's integrated USB4 cable is built directly into the dock, ensuring the cable is always matched to the dock's exact bandwidth and power specifications without risk of a lower-quality substitute cable degrading performance, but this also means the cable cannot be replaced if it becomes damaged, requiring replacement of the entire dock instead. This matters if cable damage from wear, pets, or accidents is a realistic concern in your environment, where a detachable cable design lets you simply replace just the cable, and matters less if the dock will sit in a low-traffic, protected location where cable damage is unlikely. Consider whether an integrated or detachable cable design better suits your specific environment and risk of physical cable damage over the dock's lifetime."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BYOD-Specific Engineering Addresses Real Deployment Challenges That a Standard Home Dock Doesn't Solve",
    "explanation": "The StarTech BYOD-focused pick specifically includes built-in lock slots and Surface/VESA mounting compatibility, features engineered for scalable, zero-touch rollouts across shared workspaces and corporate environments where multiple different devices connect to the same dock over time and physical security matters. This matters if you're deploying docks across a shared office, coworking space, or hot-desking environment, and matters less for a single dedicated home office desk where physical security and multi-device rollout aren't practical concerns. Consider whether your specific deployment context (shared workspace versus single dedicated desk) benefits from BYOD-specific security and mounting features before choosing based on core display specs alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Chip Mac Compatibility Details Matter Even for Docks That Broadly Claim macOS Support",
    "explanation": "The StarTech mini dock's listing specifically documents that dual display support works on M1, M2, M3 Max/Pro, and M4 Pro/Max MacBooks, while base M-series MacBooks and iPad Pro M1 and later are limited to a single external display, a granular compatibility breakdown that matters directly if you're on a base-tier Mac chip. This matters significantly if you own a base M-series Mac and are expecting dual-display support from any Mac-compatible dock, and matters less if you already own a Pro, Max, or Ultra-tier Mac chip. Check a dock's specific per-chip Mac compatibility documentation rather than assuming a general 'macOS compatible' claim guarantees the same display capability across every Mac chip generation."

  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a USB4 dock with DisplayPort?", "a": "Assuming any dock with DisplayPort output supports the same gaming and streaming capabilities, without checking whether the dock uses native GPU video output or DisplayLink compression technology, which have fundamentally different capabilities for gaming and protected content." },
  { "q": "Is the Lenovo USB4 Smart Dock 5500 worth the price premium over the StarTech mini dock for basic office use?", "a": "If you specifically want both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort outputs with an integrated cable in one dock, the Lenovo's premium is justified, but for basic dual-DisplayPort display needs, the StarTech mini dock delivers the same native video quality at a dramatically lower price." },
  { "q": "Does the StarTech BYOD dock work with my MacBook?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states this specific dock is not compatible with macOS or ChromeOS, designed specifically for Windows-based BYOD and shared workspace deployments, so Mac users should choose the StarTech mini dock or Lenovo pick instead." },
  { "q": "Do I need to keep my laptop's original charger plugged in if I use the Plugable dock?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically states this docking station does not charge the host computer, so you'll need to keep your laptop's own charger connected separately even while using the dock for displays and peripherals." },
  { "q": "Can I mount these docks to the back of a monitor or under a desk?", "a": "The StarTech BYOD dock specifically supports Surface or VESA mounting with separately sold mounting accessories, while checking each other specific listing's stated mounting compatibility is worth doing if a mounted, out-of-sight setup is a priority for your desk." }
