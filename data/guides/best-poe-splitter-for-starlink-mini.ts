export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The Starlink Mini Uses Non-Standard PoE Power Delivery, Requiring a Kit Specifically Engineered for Its Exact Specifications",
    "explanation": "Every pick in this comparison is specifically engineered for the Starlink Mini's exact non-standard PoE voltage and connector requirements, rather than being a generic IEEE 802.3af/at splitter that would work with standard cameras and access points but not necessarily with Starlink's proprietary power scheme. This matters significantly since a generic PoE splitter not specifically designed for Starlink Mini could fail to deliver correct power or damage the dish. Verify that any PoE splitter kit you're considering is specifically marketed and engineered for Starlink Mini compatibility, rather than assuming a generic PoE splitter will work with Starlink's non-standard power delivery."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP68 Waterproof Certification Represents a Meaningfully Higher Standard Than a General 'Heavy-Duty' or 'Weatherproof' Housing Claim",
    "explanation": "The IP68 pick specifically states certification for prolonged immersion in water, a concrete, testable standard distinct from the other picks' general heavy-duty ABS housing claims that don't cite a specific IP rating number. This matters significantly if your Starlink Mini installation faces genuine water exposure risk, like a boat deck, RV roof in heavy rain, or an exposed marine environment, and matters less for a covered or minimally exposed installation. Look for a specifically cited IP rating number rather than general 'weatherproof' or 'heavy-duty' language if genuine water submersion risk is a real factor in your installation location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Surge Protection Voltage Ratings Provide Real, Checkable Assurance Against Lightning and Electrical Damage",
    "explanation": "The EDUP LOVE and SURVADV picks both specifically state surge protection ratings (+/-8KV) and ESD discharge protection (+/-15KV air), concrete figures that quantify the actual protection level, distinct from the IP68 and XLTTYWL picks that don't specify an equivalent surge protection voltage. This matters significantly if your Starlink Mini installation is in a location with genuine lightning strike risk, like an elevated rooftop or open field, and matters less for a more sheltered installation with lower surge exposure. Check for specifically named surge protection voltage ratings if lightning or electrical surge risk is a real concern for your installation location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Integration With Your Existing Starlink Mini Cable Avoids Cutting or Splicing the Original Proprietary Cable",
    "explanation": "The XLTTYWL pick specifically states its design utilizes your original Starlink Mini cable for setup, avoiding the need to cut or splice the proprietary cable, which matters since damaging the original Starlink cable could void warranty coverage or create a point of failure. This matters if you want to preserve your original Starlink cable's integrity and potential warranty status, and matters less if you're comfortable with a full replacement setup or your warranty period has already passed. Check whether a splitter kit specifically integrates with your existing cable or requires cutting/splicing before choosing based on preserving your original equipment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Total Power Delivery Between the Injector and Splitter Components May Differ, With the Splitter Often Rated Lower",
    "explanation": "The EDUP LOVE and SURVADV picks both specifically state a 150W injector paired with a lower-rated 100W isolated splitter, meaning the actual power reaching your Starlink Mini through the splitter component is lower than the injector's headline wattage figure alone suggests. This matters if you're evaluating a kit's real power delivery capability, since the splitter's lower rating, not just the injector's, determines what actually reaches your dish. Check both the injector and splitter's individually stated wattage ratings in a kit, not just the higher injector figure, to understand the real power delivery to your Starlink Mini."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use a generic PoE splitter with my Starlink Mini instead of a Starlink-specific kit?", "a": "No, the Starlink Mini uses non-standard PoE power delivery specific to its own design, so a generic IEEE 802.3af/at splitter built for standard cameras and access points may not deliver correct power or could risk damaging the dish, making a Starlink-specific kit necessary." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a PoE splitter for Starlink Mini?", "a": "Assuming a kit's headline injector wattage figure reflects the actual power reaching the dish, when the paired splitter component is often rated at a meaningfully lower wattage than the injector, as seen in both the EDUP LOVE and SURVADV picks." },
  { "q": "Is the IP68 waterproof pick worth it if I'm only using Starlink Mini in a fixed home installation?", "a": "For a sheltered home installation without genuine water exposure, the IP68 rating provides less practical benefit, and the EDUP LOVE pick's stronger surge protection specifications may be more relevant if lightning risk is a concern instead." },
  { "q": "Do I need a separate voltage step-up converter for these Starlink Mini PoE kits?", "a": "The SURVADV and XLTTYWL listings both specifically note that a voltage step-up converter is not included and required separately, so checking each kit's exact requirements before purchase is important to avoid an incomplete setup." },
  { "q": "Will cutting my original Starlink Mini cable void my warranty?", "a": "Modifying the original Starlink cable could affect warranty coverage, which is why the XLTTYWL pick's design specifically avoids cutting or splicing by integrating with your existing cable instead." },
  { "q": "How much power do these kits actually deliver to the Starlink Mini dish?", "a": "It varies by kit; the EDUP LOVE and SURVADV kits specifically state a 100W isolated splitter output despite a 150W injector rating, so checking the specific splitter wattage, not just the injector figure, tells you the real power delivered to the dish." }
