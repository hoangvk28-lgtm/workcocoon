  "An under-desk printer stand only works if the combined height of your desk clearance, the stand, and the printer itself actually fits together. A standard desk clears about 24 inches underneath, a standing desk at its lowest setting clears 27 inches or more, and an adjustable desk can reach 28 to 30 inches. A roughly 14-inch stand plus a printer that stands 10 to 15 inches tall can total 24 to 29 inches on its own, which is close enough to the edge that it is worth measuring before buying rather than after.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify real weight capacity against your printer's actual weight, not the display model",
    "explanation": "A printer stand's listed weight capacity is often demonstrated with a small inkjet in marketing photos, which understates the load a genuinely heavy all-in-one laser printer or multifunction unit with a large paper tray actually places on the platform.\n\nThis matters because a stand rated below your specific printer's real weight can flex, wobble, or fail over time even if it looks sturdy when empty, and this category overlaps heavily with CPU tower stands and monitor risers that were never marketed for printer weight specifically.\n\nCheck your printer's actual listed weight in its own spec sheet, and compare it directly against the stand's stated capacity with real margin, not just enough to technically clear the number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for genuine vibration stability, not just static weight capacity",
    "explanation": "A printer generates real vibration during operation, especially a laser printer's internal mechanisms or an inkjet's print head carriage moving back and forth, and a stand that holds static weight fine can still wobble or transmit noise during active printing if its construction isn't rigid enough.\n\nThis matters more for a printer used frequently throughout the day, where vibration and noise become a real recurring annoyance, less for one used only occasionally.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of stability or wobble during actual printing, not just whether the stand holds the printer's weight while sitting idle."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider ventilation clearance for a printer's exhaust and paper path",
    "explanation": "Many printers vent heat from internal components and need clearance around the paper output tray for pages to eject without jamming, and a stand or enclosure that boxes the printer in too tightly can interfere with both, and this becomes a real issue with fully enclosed cabinet-style stands versus open shelf designs.\n\nThis matters more for a printer under regular heavy use generating real internal heat, and for any stand style that partially encloses the unit rather than a simple open platform.\n\nCheck the stand's design for open sides or back clearance around where your printer vents and ejects paper, not just its front-facing dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match storage features to what you'll actually use them for",
    "explanation": "Many printer stands include drawers or shelves for paper and supplies, and while this consolidates printer supplies in one spot, an oversized storage-heavy stand can eat significantly more floor or desk space than a simple platform-only riser, without adding proportional benefit if you don't actually keep much paper or supplies nearby.\n\nThis matters directly if floor or desk space is genuinely tight, where a simpler platform-only design maximizes the space savings that's likely the whole point of buying a stand in the first place.\n\nCheck the stand's actual footprint including any drawers or shelves against your available space, not just the platform surface dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh honest labeling: a CPU stand or monitor riser can work just as well as a dedicated printer stand",
    "explanation": "This product category overlaps heavily with CPU tower stands and monitor risers, since a low, stable platform rated for real weight works just as well under a compact printer as under a computer tower, even when it was never marketed specifically as a printer stand, and this often means more design and price options than searching \"printer stand\" alone would surface.\n\nThis matters because limiting your search strictly to products labeled \"printer stand\" can mean missing a better-built, better-priced option marketed for a different but functionally identical use case.\n\nCheck listed dimensions and real weight capacity rather than the product category label alone, since a well-built CPU stand or monitor riser with adequate capacity is a legitimate substitute."

    q: "How do I know if a printer stand will actually fit under my desk?",
    a: "Add your desk's clearance (about 24 inches for a standard desk, 27 inches or more for a standing desk at its lowest setting, 28 to 30 inches for an adjustable desk) and compare it against the stand's height plus your printer's height, typically 10 to 15 inches. A 14-inch stand plus a 12-inch printer already totals 26 inches, which will not clear a standard desk even though each piece looks compact separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it harder to use a printer once it's placed under a desk?",
    a: "Yes, and it is worth being upfront about it: loading paper, checking status lights, and grabbing printed pages all become harder when the printer sits below desk level rather than at eye level. Stands with rolling casters, like the HUANUO, meaningfully offset this by letting you slide the whole unit out for use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can an enclosed under-desk space make a printer louder?",
    a: "It can. Sound reflecting off the underside of a desk can make a printer's fan or paper feed noticeably louder than the same printer sitting in the open. Open-frame stands like the HOOBRO avoid compounding this effect compared to a fully boxed-in cabinet.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I avoid putting a printer under my desk at all?",
    a: "Skip under-desk placement for an all-in-one with a top-opening scanner lid, since it needs 12 to 15 inches of overhead clearance a desk blocks entirely, and for top-load paper tray printers generally. A desktop riser like the WALI is the more honest fit for those cases.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do CPU stands or monitor risers actually work as printer stands under a desk?",
    a: "They can, and we frame them honestly in this list rather than calling them printer furniture. The Liitrton and Hovadova CPU stands sit low and roll easily, which solves the same height-stacking problem a dedicated under-desk printer stand solves, though they lack dedicated cable management and are rated for lighter loads.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a laser printer need special consideration for under-desk placement?",
    a: "Yes. Laser printers generate real heat and need airflow to dissipate it during longer print jobs, and a fully enclosed under-desk cabinet with no ventilation can trap that heat. An open-frame or ventilated stand, like the Hovadova CPU stand, is the safer choice for a laser printer than a solid-sided cabinet.",
