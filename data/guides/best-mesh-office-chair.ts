  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is a mesh office chair better than a leather chair?", a: "Mesh is better for breathability and all-day temperature comfort. Leather is better for traditional executive aesthetics and durability of the surface material. For users in warm offices or who sit 6-plus hours daily, mesh significantly reduces back and seat heat buildup. For users in consistently cool air-conditioned offices who value traditional aesthetics, leather is equally comfortable. Ergonomic adjustability is the same issue in both - it depends on the specific chair, not the material." },
  { q: "Does a mesh office chair last as long as a padded chair?", a: "Premium mesh chairs (Herman Miller, Steelcase) are warranted for 12 years specifically including the mesh component. Budget mesh chairs may sag within 2 to 3 years. The mesh itself is more likely to degrade than the frame. By contrast, padded leather chairs can have frames that outlast the foam (which compresses and flattens). Overall, the quality of the chair matters more than the material - a premium mesh chair lasts longer than a budget leather chair." },
  { q: "What is 8Z Pellicle mesh on the Herman Miller Aeron?", a: "8Z Pellicle refers to the eight zones of varying mesh tension in the Herman Miller Aeron seat and back. Zone mapping places firmer tension under the sit bones for support, softer tension under the thighs to reduce pressure on the back of the leg, and firmer tension at the back lumbar zone. The term 'pellicle' describes the material itself - a woven polymer mesh. This specific weave and zone pattern is what distinguishes Aeron mesh from standard chair mesh." },
  { q: "Are mesh chairs good in cold offices?", a: "In cold offices (below 68F), mesh chairs provide insufficient insulation and can feel cold against the back and legs, especially in winter. A mesh chair in a cold environment may require a seat cushion for thermal comfort. Leather or fabric chairs insulate better in cold conditions. If you work in a climate that varies seasonally between hot and cold, a hybrid chair with a mesh back but padded seat retains warmth while reducing back heat buildup." },
  { q: "How do I clean a mesh office chair?", a: "Most mesh chairs can be cleaned with a damp cloth and mild soap solution, then allowed to dry. For deeper cleaning, a brush with soft bristles loosens dust from mesh weave. Avoid soaking the mesh as it can affect tension. For spills, blot immediately and dry thoroughly. Do not use bleach or harsh chemical cleaners on mesh as they can weaken the polymer weave. Most Herman Miller mesh is officially rated for professional cleaning with standard office cleaners." },
