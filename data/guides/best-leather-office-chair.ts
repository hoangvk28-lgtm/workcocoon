  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How long does a PU leather office chair last?", a: "PU leather on office chairs typically shows cracking and peeling within 2 to 5 years of daily use, depending on exposure to sunlight, heat, and perspiration. The foam underneath may last longer, but the surface failure makes the chair look worn. Genuine leather chairs can last 10 to 20 years with occasional conditioning. If you want a leather chair to last more than 5 years, genuine leather is the only reliable option." },
  { q: "Is a leather office chair comfortable for long hours?", a: "Leather is initially firmer than mesh and may take a few weeks to break in. In cool environments, leather is comfortable for 6 to 8 hours with proper ergonomic adjustment. In warm environments above 75F without air conditioning, leather traps heat and becomes uncomfortable after 2 to 3 hours. If your office gets warm, a perforated leather option or a leather chair with mesh seat panel improves breathability significantly." },
  { q: "How do I clean a leather office chair?", a: "For PU leather: wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap solution, dry immediately. Avoid alcohol-based cleaners that accelerate cracking. For genuine leather: use a dedicated leather cleaner followed by a leather conditioner every 3 to 6 months. Condition genuine leather to prevent drying and cracking, especially in air-conditioned environments. Avoid direct sunlight exposure for both types." },
  { q: "What is bonded leather and should I avoid it?", a: "Bonded leather is a manufactured material made from scraps of genuine leather and fibers bonded with polyurethane. It looks like leather initially but begins to peel and flake within 1 to 2 years, with the peeling often occurring in patches across the most-used areas. Office chairs labeled as 'bonded leather' or 'reconstituted leather' will degrade significantly faster than PU leather and should be avoided for chairs you plan to keep over 2 years." },
  { q: "Can a leather office chair be ergonomic?", a: "Yes, but the most ergonomic leather chairs cost significantly more than equivalent mesh chairs. The Steelcase Gesture in leather is fully ergonomic with all adjustments available. At lower price points, leather chairs tend to sacrifice lumbar adjustability and arm adjustability for aesthetic simplicity. For chairs under $500 in leather, verify each adjustment (lumbar height and depth, arm height and pivot, seat depth) is actually present before purchasing." },
