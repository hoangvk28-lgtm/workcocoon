  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Will any docking station drive two 4K monitors at 60Hz at the same time?",
    a: "No. Many docks that list \"dual monitor support\" only guarantee full 4K@60Hz on both screens when checked carefully, otherwise one port can cap at 30Hz or drop to 1440p once both are active. Look for a listing that explicitly states simultaneous 4K+4K@60Hz, like the WAVLINK Pro or UGREEN 8-in-1 in this guide, rather than assuming from the phrase \"dual monitor\" alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between Thunderbolt and USB4 for a dual-monitor dock?",
    a: "Thunderbolt 4 and 5 carry Intel's certification, which guarantees compatibility and bandwidth performance. USB4 docks are generally expected to work with Thunderbolt devices but aren't held to the same certified standard, and some newer AMD laptop chips ship with USB4 instead of true Thunderbolt. If reliable simultaneous dual-4K output matters to you, prioritize certified Thunderbolt hardware like the UGREEN 8-in-1 or Plugable picks in this guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my dock keep disconnecting when I run two monitors plus a file transfer?",
    a: "This is usually USB bus saturation, not a defective dock. Running dual 4K displays, fast file transfer, and a USB drive at once can overload a dock's internal USB controller, causing intermittent drops. Spreading demanding tasks across fewer simultaneous operations, avoiding daisy-chained hubs, and checking for a firmware update usually resolves it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does MST or DisplayLink matter for a multi-monitor dock?",
    a: "Yes. MST (Multi-Stream Transport) drives extra displays natively from the GPU with no compression lag, but requires GPU and driver MST support. DisplayLink uses a software driver and CPU-based compression to add displays, which works more broadly across hardware but introduces minor input lag, noticeable mainly in video editing or gaming rather than everyday office work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 100W-rated dock fully fast-charge my laptop while running dual monitors?",
    a: "Not always. A dock rated for 100W typically delivers about 10-15W less to the laptop after the dock's own circuitry draws power, so a 16-inch MacBook Pro or workstation laptop needing 100-210W under load may charge more slowly than expected. For high-power laptops, look for the highest-rated PD dock in this guide, like the Plugable 16-in-1 or Anker Prime TB5.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which dock in this guide supports the most simultaneous displays?",
    a: "The Anker Nano 13-in-1 supports 3 displays at once through its detachable hub, 2 HDMI plus 1 DisplayPort, more than most docks at its price and size. For buyers who only need 2 displays, the certified Thunderbolt UGREEN 8-in-1 and Plugable picks confirm true simultaneous dual-4K@60Hz.",
