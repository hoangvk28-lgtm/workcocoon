export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best standing desk often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best standing desk holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best standing desk over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best standing desk you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best standing desk that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Can you game standing at a standing desk?", a: "Yes. Standing gaming works well for casual and competitive play. For first-person shooters and RTS games where mouse precision matters, start at 1.5 to 2 mph below your normal standing work pace to allow more arm stability. Console gaming with a controller is comfortable standing for most users. Extended standing gaming sessions (2+ hours) benefit from an anti-fatigue mat." },
  { q: "What desk size do I need for a triple-monitor gaming setup?", a: "A triple-monitor setup with three 24-inch monitors side by side needs at least 60 inches of desk width. Three 27-inch monitors need 72 inches or more, or an L-shaped or wing-shaped desk where the side monitors sit at an angle. Measure your monitor widths including bezels, add 2 to 3 inches between each for airflow, and choose a desk at least 4 inches wider than the total." },
  { q: "Are wing-shaped gaming desks worth the extra cost?", a: "Wing-shaped desks are worth it specifically for triple-monitor setups. The curved ends angle the side monitors toward your eyes instead of pointing forward, which reduces neck rotation during long sessions. For single or dual monitors, the wing shape adds cost without meaningful ergonomic benefit. The floor space requirement also increases because the desk extends further at the sides." },
  { q: "Do standing desk frames wobble when gaming?", a: "At sitting height, almost all dual-motor frames are stable. At maximum standing height, there is some degree of front-to-back wobble in all electric standing desks. The wobble worsens under horizontal pressure such as resting arms heavily on the edge. Desks with wider crossbars and heavier frames (FLEXISPOT E6G, Secretlab Magnus) wobble noticeably less than budget single-motor options." },
  { q: "What is the best standing desk height for PC gaming?", a: "For keyboard and mouse gaming standing, set the desk so your elbows are at roughly 90 degrees and your wrists rest flat on the surface without bending up or down. This is typically 2 to 4 inches lower than your standing elbow height. Your monitor top edge should be at or slightly below eye level when standing. Many gamers find their standing gaming height is 1 to 3 inches lower than their standing typing height." },
