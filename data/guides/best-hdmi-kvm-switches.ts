export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify EDID emulation is included, regardless of price",
    "explanation": "EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is the information a monitor sends to a connected computer describing its supported resolutions and refresh rates, and a KVM switch without EDID emulation can cause a real, recurring annoyance: when you switch away from a computer, that computer loses its connection to the monitor's EDID data, and some graphics drivers respond by dropping to a default low resolution or losing the display arrangement entirely until you manually reconfigure it after switching back.\n\nA switch with proper EDID emulation stores and continuously presents the monitor's display information to every connected computer regardless of which one is actively selected, so switching back and forth doesn't repeatedly trigger resolution resets or display rearrangement.\n\nThis feature isn't reliably tied to price, a budget switch can include it while a similarly priced competitor omits it, so check the listing or current buyer reviews specifically for EDID emulation rather than assuming it based on price alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match USB peripheral support to what you actually plug in, not just keyboard and mouse",
    "explanation": "Every KVM switch handles keyboard and mouse switching as the baseline function, but USB port count and speed generation (USB 2.0 versus USB 3.0 or higher) vary significantly beyond that baseline, and this matters concretely if you also want to switch a USB webcam, external drive, audio interface, or other peripheral along with the computer selection rather than leaving it permanently connected to one machine.\n\nA switch with only two USB 2.0 ports leaves no room for anything beyond keyboard and mouse, while a switch with three or four USB 3.0 ports can handle a webcam or external drive at full speed as part of the same switching action.\n\nCount your actual USB peripherals beyond keyboard and mouse, and check both the port count and the stated USB generation against what those specific peripherals need to function at full speed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check whether switching happens via hotkey, a physical button, or both, and whether that matches your workflow",
    "explanation": "KVM switches offer switching through a physical button on the device itself, a keyboard hotkey combination (commonly a specific key pressed a set number of times), or both, and this is a genuine day-to-day usability factor rather than a minor detail, since a physical button requires reaching across or behind your desk setup every time you switch, while hotkey switching lets you change computers without moving your hands from the keyboard at all.\n\nThis matters more the more frequently you actually switch between computers during a session, someone switching once or twice a day may not care, while someone switching dozens of times while referencing one machine and working on another benefits meaningfully from hotkey support.\n\nCheck whether hotkey switching is explicitly supported and confirm the specific key combination works with your operating system, since some hotkey implementations have compatibility quirks on certain OS versions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm audio switching is included if you need it, since many KVM switches handle video and USB but not audio",
    "explanation": "A significant number of KVM switches route video and USB peripherals between computers but do not switch audio output at all, meaning your speakers or headphones stay connected to whichever computer they were originally plugged into regardless of which computer is currently selected for video and keyboard control, a genuinely confusing experience if you're not expecting it.\n\nThis is a distinct, separately-implemented feature, not something that comes automatically bundled with video and USB switching, so a switch's audio support (or lack of it) needs to be checked explicitly rather than assumed.\n\nIf you regularly use audio output and want it to follow the same switching action as your monitor and keyboard, check the listing specifically for stated audio switching support rather than assuming any KVM switch handles this by default."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check physical port placement and cable routing, since a technically capable switch can still be annoying to use daily",
    "explanation": "Beyond core specs like resolution support and port count, the physical layout of a KVM switch's ports on its housing meaningfully affects how pleasant it is to actually live with on a desk: ports crammed close together can make thick HDMI or USB-C cables difficult to seat fully, and ports facing an awkward direction relative to how the switch sits on or under your desk can turn routine cable management into a recurring frustration that a spec sheet never reveals.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of detail that only shows up in real photos of the actual unit or in buyer reviews mentioning cable fit and port spacing, not in the resolution and port-count specs that dominate most listings.\n\nLook at actual product photos showing port placement and spacing before buying, and check reviews specifically for mentions of cable clearance issues if you're using thicker high-speed cables."
