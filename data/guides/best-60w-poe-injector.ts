export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "60W Sits Between 30W and 90W for a Reason, Matching Devices That Need More Than PoE+ But Not Full PoE++",
    "explanation": "The 802.3bt standard actually defines multiple power classes, and 60W (sometimes called Type 3) sits below the 90W (Type 4) ceiling while exceeding the 30W 802.3at (PoE+) standard, matching devices like standard PTZ cameras, Wi-Fi 6 access points, and PoE lighting fixtures that need meaningfully more power than PoE+ provides but don't require the full 90W tier. This matters because buying a 90W injector for a 60W-class device wastes money on unused capacity, while a 30W injector under-powers the same device. Check your specific device's stated power class or maximum wattage draw before choosing between the 30W, 60W, and 90W tiers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Real-Time Power Output Display Provides Genuinely Useful Diagnostic Information a Status LED Cannot",
    "explanation": "A simple status LED typically only confirms that power is flowing, while a digital display showing the actual wattage being delivered lets you verify a connected device is drawing the power it should, immediately flagging an underperforming or overdrawing connection during troubleshooting. This matters more for a permanent installation where periodic verification of power delivery health is valuable, and matters less for a one-time setup you plug in and never think about again. Check the listing specifically for a stated digital display feature rather than assuming any LED indicator provides the same diagnostic depth."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "2.5G Port Speed at the 60W Tier Is Wasted Without a Matching Network Backbone",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G-capable injector like the LINOVISION pick can move more than double the data of a Gigabit-capped unit, but that capability requires both the connected device (like a Wi-Fi 6E access point) and the upstream switch to also support 2.5G speeds, otherwise the connection negotiates down to the lowest common speed anyway. This matters if you're specifically deploying newer high-throughput access points on a 2.5G-capable network, and matters much less for a standard Gigabit office or home setup. Confirm both ends of the connection support the higher speed before paying a premium for 2.5G capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Interlocking or Rack-Friendly Design Becomes a Real Consideration Once You're Deploying More Than One Injector",
    "explanation": "A single injector's physical design rarely matters much, but once you're installing several units in the same equipment closet or rack, a design that lets units slide and lock together side by side, like the BV-Tech pick specifically states, keeps the installation organized and saves physical space compared to units designed only for standalone use. This matters significantly for a multi-camera or multi-access-point deployment, and matters not at all for a single-unit home installation. Consider a listing's stated multi-unit deployment features specifically if you're purchasing more than one or two injectors for the same location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UL Certification and Manufacturer Warranty Length Are Independent Signals Worth Checking Separately",
    "explanation": "UL certification verifies electrical safety through independent third-party testing, while a stated manufacturer warranty (like LINOVISION's 3-year coverage) is a separate commercial commitment about product longevity and support, and a listing can offer one without explicitly stating the other. This matters more for a permanent installation where both electrical safety and long-term support matter, and matters less for a short-term or easily replaceable setup. Check both factors independently in the listing rather than assuming a stated warranty implies safety certification or vice versa."

  { "q": "What devices actually need a 60W PoE++ injector instead of 30W or 90W?", "a": "Standard PTZ cameras, Wi-Fi 6 access points, and PoE lighting fixtures typically fall in the 60W range, drawing more than PoE+'s 30W ceiling but less than the full 90W top tier." },
  { "q": "Is 2.5G port speed worth paying extra for at the 60W tier?", "a": "Only if your access point or camera and your network switch both actually support 2.5G speeds; otherwise the connection negotiates down to Gigabit and the extra speed capability goes unused." },
  { "q": "Can I deploy multiple 60W injectors in the same equipment rack?", "a": "Yes, though a design specifically built for that, like an interlocking side-by-side mounting feature, makes a multi-unit deployment more organized than units designed only for standalone use." },
  { "q": "Does a real-time power display actually help with troubleshooting?", "a": "Yes, it lets you confirm the exact wattage a connected device is drawing at a glance, which helps identify an underperforming connection faster than a simple on/off status LED can." },
  { "q": "Is UL certification necessary for a 60W PoE injector?", "a": "It's not strictly necessary for basic operation, but it provides independent third-party safety verification that's worth the modest price premium for a permanent installation." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between 802.3bt and 802.3at at the 60W power level?", "a": "802.3at (PoE+) tops out at 30W, so any injector rated for 60W must comply with the newer 802.3bt standard, which uses all four wire pairs in the Ethernet cable to deliver higher power levels." }
