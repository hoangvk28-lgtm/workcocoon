export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Manufacturer's Hardware Revision Can Change a Camera's DC Connector Size Without Renaming the Product Line",
    "explanation": "The DSLRKIT pick specifically warns that Philips changed the DC socket on its Bridge product from 5.5x2.1mm (v1) to 5.5x2.5mm (v2), meaning a splitter that worked perfectly with an older unit of the identical product name may not physically fit a newer revision. This matters significantly if you're replacing a splitter or buying for a device you purchased more recently than your original research, since the specific hardware revision could have changed the required connector without any obvious external labeling difference. Check your exact device's current hardware revision and measure its actual DC connector size, rather than assuming a splitter that worked with an older unit of the same product name still fits a more recently purchased one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Splitter's Maximum Wattage May Require a Higher PoE Standard Than Your Existing Switch or Injector Provides",
    "explanation": "The REVODATA pick specifically states its full 36W output requires an IEEE 802.3bt power source, since standard 802.3at PoE+ tops out at 30W, meaning the splitter won't reach its advertised maximum wattage on older or lower-tier PoE infrastructure. This matters significantly if you're buying a high-wattage splitter specifically for a demanding camera but plan to use existing 802.3at equipment, since you'd be capped below the splitter's advertised maximum. Verify your specific PoE switch or injector's exact standard (802.3af, at, or bt) against a splitter's stated requirement for reaching its full advertised wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual Connector Size Compatibility Removes Real Guesswork When You're Not Certain of Your Camera's Exact Barrel Plug Size",
    "explanation": "The PoE Splitter 5V2.5A pick specifically states compatibility with both 5.5x2.5mm and 5.5x2.1mm DC connectors, a genuinely practical hedge against connector size uncertainty compared to a fixed-connector splitter that only works with one specific size. This matters if you haven't physically measured your exact camera's connector or are buying before the camera arrives, and matters less if you've already confirmed the precise connector size needed. Consider a dual-compatible splitter specifically if you're uncertain of your exact camera's connector size, rather than risking a mismatched purchase with a fixed-connector alternative."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Switchable Multi-Voltage Output Serves PTZ Cameras and Accessories With Genuinely Different Power Requirements Than a Basic Camera",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's switchable 5V/9V/12V/24V output specifically accommodates scenarios like a PTZ camera with an additional wiper or IR illuminator that may require a different voltage than the camera body itself, a real multi-device power need that a fixed-voltage splitter can't address. This matters if you're installing a PTZ camera with accessories drawing different voltages, and matters less for a basic single-voltage IP camera with no additional accessories. Consider a switchable multi-voltage splitter specifically if your installation involves multiple devices or accessories with different voltage requirements sharing the same PoE source."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "2.5Gbps or Gigabit Speed Support Matters More as Camera Resolution Increases Beyond Standard HD",
    "explanation": "The REVODATA pick specifically supports 2.5Gbps speed, genuinely useful for a high-resolution 4K camera that can exceed standard Gigabit bandwidth under demanding conditions, while the budget picks in this comparison cap out at 100Mbps, adequate for lower-resolution cameras but a real bottleneck for 4K footage. This matters if your specific camera records at 4K or higher resolution with high bitrate settings, and matters less for a standard 1080p or lower-resolution camera that doesn't approach even Gigabit bandwidth limits. Match a splitter's speed rating to your camera's actual resolution and bitrate requirements rather than assuming any speed rating is sufficient for your specific footage quality."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How do I know which DC connector size my IP camera needs for a PoE splitter?", "a": "Checking your camera's product documentation for its exact DC barrel plug specification, or physically measuring the connector, is the reliable way to confirm compatibility, though a dual-compatible splitter like the PoE Splitter 5V2.5A pick removes this guesswork if you're unsure." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a PoE splitter for a camera?", "a": "Assuming a splitter that worked with an older version of a device automatically works with a newer hardware revision of the same product, when manufacturers sometimes change connector sizes between revisions without renaming the product line." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION splitter worth the much higher price over the budget picks?", "a": "If you're specifically powering a PTZ camera with accessories like a wiper or IR illuminator needing different voltages, the LINOVISION's switchable multi-voltage design and higher price are justified, but for a basic single-voltage camera, the budget picks deliver adequate performance for much less." },
  { "q": "Will the REVODATA splitter's full 36W output work with my existing PoE switch?", "a": "Only if your switch or injector specifically supports the IEEE 802.3bt standard; on a standard 802.3at switch, the REVODATA splitter's output will be capped below its full 36W rating, so checking your PoE source's exact standard is important." },
  { "q": "Can I use a 5V PoE splitter with a camera that needs 12V power?", "a": "No, connecting a splitter with the wrong output voltage to your camera can cause it to malfunction or fail to power on, so verifying your camera's exact voltage requirement against the splitter's stated output before connecting is essential." },
  { "q": "Do I need 2.5Gbps speed for a standard 1080p security camera?", "a": "No, a standard 1080p camera's bandwidth needs fall well within 100Mbps or Gigabit speed, so the 2.5Gbps REVODATA pick's extra bandwidth is specifically worth the investment only for 4K or higher-resolution camera footage." }
