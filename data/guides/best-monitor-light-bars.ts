      "The Quntis Computer Monitor Lamp is a clip-on bar that mounts on the monitor top edge and directs illumination downward onto the desk surface rather than toward the screen.

The auto-dimming sensor adjusts brightness based on ambient room light, which removes the need to manually increase or decrease brightness when daylight or overhead lighting changes.

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is a monitor light bar and how is it different from a desk lamp?",
    a: "A monitor light bar mounts on top of the monitor bezel and directs light downward onto the desk surface rather than across the room. It reduces eye strain by minimizing the contrast between the bright screen and the darker desk area. Unlike a desk lamp, it does not create glare on the monitor screen and takes up no desk space.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are monitor light bars compatible with curved monitors?",
    a: "Compatibility depends on the curvature radius. Most standard bars (BenQ ScreenBar Classic, Quntis standard) work with monitors curved to 1500R or above. Monitors with a 1000R to 1800R curve require purpose-built curved designs like the BenQ ScreenBar Pro, ScreenBar Halo 2, or the Quntis Curved variants. Always check the product specifications before purchasing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does CRI mean for a monitor light bar?",
    a: "CRI stands for Color Rendering Index and measures how accurately a light source renders colors compared to natural sunlight. A CRI of 95 or higher means colors on your desk, documents, and objects appear close to their true colors. Most quality light bars in this roundup have CRI 95 or CRI 98. Lower CRI values can make skin tones and colored materials look slightly off.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need auto-dimming on a monitor light bar?",
    a: "Auto-dimming is useful if your room lighting changes throughout the day. The sensor detects ambient light levels and adjusts the bar brightness automatically, so you do not need to manually adjust when sunlight fades in the afternoon or when overhead lights turn on. Without auto-dimming, you adjust brightness manually each time conditions change.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between the BenQ ScreenBar Pro and the BenQ ScreenBar Halo 2?",
    a: "The ScreenBar Pro focuses on maximum front lighting with a motion sensor for auto-on and off at 1000 Lux output, priced at $139. The ScreenBar Halo 2 adds a back-facing ambient light that reduces the contrast between the screen glow and the wall behind the monitor, which is useful in dark rooms or for gaming setups. The Halo 2 is priced at $199 but does not have a motion sensor.",
