  {
    title: "Buying a hub expecting dual-monitor support",

  },
  {
    title: "Ignoring your laptop's USB-C controller",
    body: "Not all USB-C ports are equal. Some carry only data and charging — not video. DisplayPort Alt Mode or Thunderbolt is required for external monitor output. Check your laptop's spec sheet for the ports labeled 'Thunderbolt' or 'DP'.",
  },
  {
    title: "Over-buying a dock for a portable lifestyle",
    body: "A $120 dock requires a power adapter and a fixed desk spot. If you commute daily or work from different locations, a $35–$50 travel hub does 90% of the job and fits in your pocket.",
  },
  {
    title: "Assuming all hubs charge at the rated wattage",
    body: "A hub rated '100W PD' still shares the laptop's USB-C power budget. Under heavy GPU or CPU load, effective charging may drop to 60–70W. For MacBook Pro 16-inch or gaming laptops, verify the hub's active PD delivery with reviews.",

// ─── FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const faq: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a USB-C hub and a docking station?",
    a: "A USB-C hub is bus-powered (draws power from your laptop), portable, and handles 4–8 ports. A docking station has its own power adapter, sits permanently on a desk, and handles 10–13+ ports including dual monitor outputs. Hubs are for portability; docks are for permanent desk setups.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a USB-C hub support dual monitors?",
    a: "Most cannot. Standard USB-C hubs support one external display via HDMI or DisplayPort. Dual-display support requires a docking station (or a USB4/Thunderbolt hub with MST support, which costs dock prices anyway).",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a docking station worth it?",
    a: "Yes, if you have a fixed desk and want one-cable convenience — plug in a single USB-C and your monitor, keyboard, mouse, Ethernet, and audio all connect. The productivity gain is real once you cross 4+ daily peripherals. The $100–$150 cost is a one-time desk upgrade.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a USB-C hub work with any laptop?",
    a: "With any laptop that has a USB-C port, yes — for data and charging. For video output, your laptop needs a USB-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode or Thunderbolt 3/4. Most MacBooks and recent Windows laptops do; older budget laptops may not.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best USB-C hub for MacBook?",
    a: "The Anker 555 (8-in-1) is a top choice for MacBook Air and Pro users — it adds Ethernet, a 4K display, USB-A ports, and 100W PD charging. For MacBook Pro 16-inch, consider a dock if you use dual monitors, since MacBook Pro supports up to three external displays with Thunderbolt.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a USB-C hub with a gaming laptop?",
    a: "Yes for data, charging, and display. However, gaming laptops with high TDP may require 100W+ to charge under gaming load — verify the hub's PD wattage. The Anker 555 or 575 dock handles most gaming laptops at idle to moderate load.",
