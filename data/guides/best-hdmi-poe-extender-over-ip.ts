export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Most 'PoE' HDMI-Over-IP Extenders Actually Use PoC, a Different Proprietary Power Scheme",
    "explanation": "Only the PWAY 400ft pick in this comparison specifically confirms compatibility with a genuine PoE switch, while the OREI, Steetek, and PWAY 500ft picks all use PoC (Power over Cable), a scheme that sends power from the transmitter to receiver over the same cable but does not draw from your network's actual PoE infrastructure. This matters significantly if you specifically want to power the extender from an existing PoE switch to avoid using a wall outlet at the receiver end, since a PoC-based extender still requires plugging its power adapter into an outlet, just at one end instead of two. Check whether a listing specifically confirms compatibility with a genuine PoE switch (drawing power from network infrastructure) versus PoC (single-cable power between transmitter and receiver only) before assuming both terms mean the same thing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "4K Resolution Support Comes With Real Cabling and Distance Tradeoffs Compared to 1080p",
    "explanation": "The OREI KVM 4K pick specifically supports 4K@60Hz but requires high-quality Cat6/Cat7 cable and has a shorter 230ft range, compared to the 1080p-only PWAY and Steetek picks that reach 400-500ft over the same cable categories. This matters if your source content and displays are genuinely 4K and you want to preserve that resolution over the extension, and matters less if your content and displays are 1080p, where the extra 4K support provides no visible benefit. Match your extender's resolution support to your actual source and display capabilities, and factor in the typically shorter range and stricter cable requirements that come with 4K-capable models."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB KVM Extension Lets You Control a Remote Computer's Keyboard and Mouse From the Receiver End",
    "explanation": "The OREI KVM pick specifically includes USB KVM Extension, letting you control a PC located at the transmitter end using a keyboard and mouse connected at the receiver end, a genuinely distinct feature not present on the other picks in this comparison. This matters if you're extending a workstation or server to a remote location where you need full input control, not just video display, and matters less if you only need to display video output without remote input control. Check whether an HDMI-over-IP extender specifically includes KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) extension if you need to control the source computer remotely, not just view its output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "One-to-Many Distribution Requires a Compatible Network Switch, Not Just a Direct Cable Connection",
    "explanation": "The PWAY picks specifically state one-to-many output works through a network switch (standard, 100M/1000M, or gigabit depending on the model), meaning the multi-display broadcast capability depends on routing the signal through compatible network infrastructure rather than simply connecting multiple receivers directly. This matters if you're planning a genuine one-to-many deployment across several displays, since you'll need to budget for and configure a compatible switch alongside the extender units themselves. Check a one-to-many capable extender's specific switch requirements (switch type, port count, gigabit versus standard) before assuming any network switch will support the multi-display feature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "EDID Copy Functionality Helps Establish Correct Resolution Automatically Between Mismatched Source and Display Hardware",
    "explanation": "The Steetek pick's specifically named built-in EDID copy function reads and stores display information to help the transmitter and receiver establish the correct resolution automatically, reducing a common real-world HDMI extension problem where a source and display fail to negotiate a working resolution over a long cable run. This matters if you've had resolution negotiation issues with HDMI extensions in the past or are connecting mismatched source and display hardware, and matters less if you're using well-matched, modern equipment that reliably negotiates resolution on its own. Check for a specifically named EDID handling feature if you anticipate connecting hardware that might have resolution negotiation issues over an extended HDMI connection."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a PoC HDMI extender the same thing as a true PoE HDMI extender?", "a": "No, PoC (Power over Cable) sends power between the transmitter and receiver over the same cable but doesn't draw from your network's actual PoE switch, while true PoE compatibility, like the PWAY 400ft pick specifically offers, lets the extender draw power directly from an existing PoE switch on your network." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an HDMI extender labeled 'PoE'?", "a": "Assuming any HDMI extender labeled with PoE-related terms draws power from a genuine PoE switch, when most products in this category actually use PoC, a different proprietary single-cable power scheme that still requires a wall outlet at one end." },
  { "q": "Is the OREI KVM 4K extender worth the higher price over the Steetek pick?", "a": "If you specifically need 4K resolution and remote KVM control for a workstation setup, the OREI's higher price is justified, but for a simple 1080p point-to-point extension, the Steetek pick's much lower price delivers adequate performance." },
  { "q": "Can I connect multiple displays to a single HDMI source using these extenders?", "a": "Yes, both PWAY picks in this comparison specifically support one-to-many distribution through a compatible network switch, letting one HDMI source feed multiple displays for signage or classroom use." },
  { "q": "Do I need a special network switch for a one-to-many HDMI extender setup?", "a": "Yes, the PWAY picks specifically require a compatible network switch (standard, 100M/1000M, or gigabit depending on the model) for one-to-many distribution to work, so budgeting for and configuring that switch is a necessary part of the deployment." },
  { "q": "Will these HDMI-over-IP extenders work over my regular home Wi-Fi network?", "a": "No, these extenders specifically require a wired Ethernet connection using Cat5e, Cat6, or Cat7 cable; they transmit HDMI signals over the physical network cable itself, not over Wi-Fi, and one listing specifically warns against using them on a regular shared home network." }
