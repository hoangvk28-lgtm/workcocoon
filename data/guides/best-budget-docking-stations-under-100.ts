Like most hub-style docks in this price range, it draws its power from the laptop itself rather than including its own power brick, so it adds convenience without adding real charging capacity.

    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Why does my budget dock only run my monitor at 4K@30Hz instead of 60Hz?",
    a: "Many budget docks advertise '4K support' without specifying the refresh rate, and a lot of them deliver 4K@30Hz over HDMI rather than the smoother 60Hz. Check if your dock has a DisplayPort output as well, since that port often carries the full 60Hz signal even when the HDMI port is capped.

    q: "Why does my dock make my devices disconnect after an hour of use?",
    a: "Random disconnects after 30 to 60 minutes of use are the classic symptom of a dock overheating, especially common on compact, passively-cooled budget docks running multiple ports or displays at once. Favor a dock with a sturdier aluminum housing and better airflow, like the Anker 8-in-1 in this list, if you plan to keep it running for full workdays.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to buy a separate cable for a budget docking station?",
    a: "Check the listing carefully before buying, since some budget docks don't include a compatible cable at all, which adds $10 to $20 to the real cost once you buy one separately. Others include a cable so short the dock has to sit right next to the laptop, which defeats the point of a clean desk setup. All 7 picks in this list are evaluated with their included cable length and connection type in mind.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a budget dock under $100 fully charge my laptop?",
    a: "Most docks under $100 are bus-powered hubs, meaning they draw all their power from the laptop's own battery or charger rather than supplying independent power, so they won't add charging capacity on top of what your laptop already provides. The HP Dock G5 is the exception in this list, since it ships with its own dedicated power adapter and can genuinely contribute to charging rather than just passing through what the laptop already has.",
