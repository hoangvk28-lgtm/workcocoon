  "Approaching $800, quad-band routers enter this budget-tier series for the first time, adding a second 5GHz or 6GHz radio specifically dedicated to mesh backhaul traffic, so device speeds don't drop when a mesh system talks to itself in the background.",
  "We compared this lineup on genuine quad-band versus tri-band architecture, whether backhaul traffic gets its own dedicated radio or competes with regular device traffic, and combined speed figures at the very top of what WiFi 7 currently offers, since at this price the differences are architectural, not just incremental spec bumps."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Quad-Band Architecture Solves a Real Bandwidth Contention Problem in Mesh Systems",
    "explanation": "In a standard tri-band mesh system, the units often need to share the same radio bands for both communicating with your devices and communicating with each other (backhaul traffic), which can create contention when both types of traffic compete for the same limited bandwidth, especially under heavy simultaneous use. Genuine quad-band routers, like the ASUS picks in this comparison, add a fourth dedicated radio specifically to separate this backhaul traffic from device traffic, meaningfully reducing this contention in demanding, high-device-count households."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Single Powerful Router's Coverage Claim Doesn't Scale the Same Way a Mesh System's Does",
    "explanation": "The ASUS ROG Rapture GT-BE98 Pro in this comparison doesn't state a specific coverage square footage figure, which is common for very high-end single routers since their effective range depends heavily on your home's specific construction and layout rather than a standardized lab test figure. If coverage predictability matters more to you than raw peak speed, a mesh system with an explicitly stated square footage claim, like the Orbi 770 or Deco 7 Pro, gives you a more concrete expectation to plan around."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Buying a Single Expandable Unit Costs More Per-Unit Than a Bundled Multi-Pack",
    "explanation": "The ASUS ZenWiFi BQ16 Pro in this comparison is sold as a single unit specifically so buyers can expand gradually, but purchasing additional individual units later to build out a 2 or 3-unit system will generally cost more in total than buying an equivalent multi-unit pack upfront, similar to how the Deco 7 Pro's 2-pack and 3-pack are priced. This tradeoff is worth accepting only if you genuinely aren't sure how much coverage you'll need yet, or want to spread the cost out over time rather than committing to a full system immediately."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Triple-Level Game Acceleration and Similar Multi-Hop Optimization Address Latency, Not Just Bandwidth",
    "explanation": "A high combined speed figure like 30 Gbps mainly reflects how much data can move at once, but competitive gaming performance depends more heavily on latency, the delay between an action and its effect reaching the game server. Technology like the ASUS ROG Rapture's Triple-Level Game Acceleration specifically targets this delay at multiple points in the network path, a genuinely different engineering focus than simply having the highest raw bandwidth number, worth prioritizing specifically if competitive gaming performance is your main reason for buying at this price tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "At This Price Point, Confirm You Actually Need the Coverage or Speed Before Buying the Most Expensive Option",
    "explanation": "Every router in this comparison delivers substantially more speed and coverage than a typical household needs, so before choosing the priciest quad-band pick simply because it has the highest numbers, honestly assess your home's actual size, your household's device count, and whether you have an internet plan or use case that could genuinely use speeds in the 11-30 Gbps range. For many buyers, the tri-band Deco 7 Pro 3-pack at $399.98 already exceeds what their home and internet plan can practically use."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a quad-band router if I only have a moderate number of connected devices?", "a": "Probably not. Quad-band architecture, like on the ASUS picks in this comparison, mainly benefits households with many simultaneously connected devices or larger mesh setups where backhaul traffic contention becomes noticeable. A tri-band system like the NETGEAR Orbi 770 or TP-Link Deco 7 Pro handles moderate device counts very well." },
  { "q": "Can I actually use 30 Gbps of bandwidth from the ASUS ROG Rapture GT-BE98 Pro with a typical home internet plan?", "a": "No, this combined figure represents the router's total theoretical wireless capacity across all bands and connected devices, not your internet connection speed, which is limited by whatever plan you subscribe to from your internet service provider, almost certainly far below 30 Gbps for residential service." },
  { "q": "Is it cheaper to buy the ASUS ZenWiFi BQ16 Pro as a single unit now and add more later, or should I look for a multi-pack?", "a": "Generally, buying a bundled multi-pack version of a comparable system upfront, if available, tends to be more cost-effective per unit than purchasing individual units over time, so only choose the gradual single-unit expansion approach if you're genuinely uncertain about your total coverage needs." },
  { "q": "What's the practical benefit of the NETGEAR Orbi 770's Enhanced Backhaul versus a standard mesh backhaul connection?", "a": "Enhanced Backhaul on the Orbi 770 helps ensure that communication between mesh units doesn't slow down device speeds as much during high simultaneous usage, similar in goal to quad-band dedicated backhaul, though NETGEAR implements this within its tri-band architecture rather than adding a full fourth radio band." },
  { "q": "Does the ASUS ROG Rapture GT-BE98 Pro's gaming focus mean it's worse for general non-gaming use?", "a": "No, its gaming-specific features like Triple-Level Game Acceleration work alongside its general high-speed WiFi 7 performance rather than replacing it, so it functions as a genuinely fast all-purpose router for the whole household, with additional optimization specifically benefiting gaming traffic." },
  { "q": "Should I choose the TP-Link Deco 7 Pro 3-Pack over the pricier quad-band options if I'm not sure I need the extra speed?", "a": "If you're uncertain whether you need quad-band architecture or speeds above what a strong tri-band mesh system delivers, starting with the more affordable Deco 7 Pro 3-Pack is a reasonable choice, since it still delivers strong coverage and device capacity for meaningfully less money than the quad-band picks in this comparison." }
