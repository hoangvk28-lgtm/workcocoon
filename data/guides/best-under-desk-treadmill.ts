    "explanation": "An under-desk treadmill needs to physically slide into the same clearance a chair would otherwise occupy, and this clearance varies by desk, both the standing desk's lowest sit height and any crossbar or cable tray underneath can limit how tall a treadmill fits.\n\nThis matters because a treadmill that looks compact in photos can still be too tall for your specific desk's clearance, a mismatch that's only discovered after the treadmill arrives.\n\nMeasure the actual clear height under your desk at its lowest working position, and compare that against the treadmill's listed height, leaving real margin rather than an exact match."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match motor power and speed range to walking, not running, since that's what these are built for",
    "explanation": "Most under-desk treadmills are built for a slow 1-4 mph walking pace during work, not a running pace, and their motors are sized accordingly, a lighter-duty motor rated for walking speeds will struggle or wear out faster if pushed toward running speeds it wasn't designed for.\n\nThis matters directly if you're specifically hoping to run rather than walk while working, a genuine running-capable treadmill needs a meaningfully more powerful motor and a different category of product than most under-desk walking pads.\n\nCheck the listed max speed and motor horsepower rating against your actual intended pace, and don't assume any \"treadmill\" labeled product supports running speeds."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check noise level specifically for video calls and shared office spaces",
    "explanation": "A treadmill's motor and belt generate continuous noise while walking, and that noise level matters far more for this category than a typical treadmill, since you'll likely be on video calls or in a shared workspace while using it, a treadmill quiet enough for a private home gym can still be distracting on a work call in an open office.\n\nThis matters more the more of your work involves calls or a shared space, less if you work in a private office with the door closed.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for noise mentions during video calls or in shared spaces, not just a general decibel rating that may be measured under different conditions."

    "explanation": "An auto-stop safety cord (clipped to your clothing, stopping the belt if you step off unexpectedly) and a remote or app-based start/stop control matter more for this category than a typical gym treadmill, since you'll be dividing attention between the treadmill and actual work rather than fully focused on walking.\n\nThis matters because a moment of distraction while multitasking is exactly when an unexpected stumble is most likely, and having quick, reliable stop control reduces that risk.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a safety cord and remote control features, not just speed and incline specs."

    "criterion": "Consider incline if you want a genuine calorie-burn increase, not just flat walking",
    "explanation": "An incline feature meaningfully increases calorie burn and leg engagement compared to flat walking at the same speed, but it's a feature most under-desk treadmills skip entirely to keep the profile slim and the price down, and even among models that offer it, incline range varies from a token few degrees to a genuinely adjustable range.\n\nThis matters more if fitness intensity is a real goal beyond just light movement during work, less if you're primarily looking for gentle activity while working.\n\nCheck whether incline is offered at all and, if so, the specific adjustable range in degrees, not just the word \"incline\" in the listing."

    q: "How much clearance do I need under my desk for a treadmill?",
    a: "Most under-desk treadmills need about 9-12 inches of vertical clearance between the floor and the underside of the desk. Standard desks run 28-30 inches tall, but crossbars and drawers can reduce the usable gap, so measure your desk's actual opening rather than relying on its listed height.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can you go on an under-desk treadmill?",
    a: "Most picks in this guide top out around 3.75-5 mph, a walking pace rather than a running one, since the category is designed for light movement during work. The LifeSpan Fitness TX6 is the exception at up to 6 mph, built for heavier daily use beyond typical desk walking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are under-desk treadmills quiet enough for video calls?",
    a: "Magnetic and brushless motors, used across most of the picks in this guide, run quieter than older friction-driven designs. Aim for equipment rated under 15dB for near-silent operation, with up to 30dB still tolerable but noticeable, which is roughly where a rating like the Viamotion's around 45dB sits on the audible side.",
  },
  {
    q: "What safety features should I look for in a walking treadmill?",
    a: "Look for an auto-stop sensor that halts the belt if you step off, and ideally a safety clip or lanyard that clips to your clothing and pulls the stop cord if you trip or fall. A soft-start feature that begins at a very low speed, around 0.3-0.6 mph, also helps reduce the chance of being caught off guard when the belt starts moving.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where should the power cord go on an under-desk treadmill?",
    a: "Route the power cord away from your walking path, ideally along a wall or under a cord cover, rather than leaving it loose on the floor near the belt. This matters more on a treadmill than most desk gear because you're actively walking on or near the unit, and a snagged cord is a real trip hazard.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the LifeSpan Fitness TX6 worth the higher price?",
    a: "It has the most powerful motor, widest speed and incline range, and highest weight capacity in this guide, which suits heavy daily professional use. That said, this specific listing currently has only 2 reviews, so its real-world track record isn't yet proven despite the established brand name and premium spec sheet.",
