export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "VIA and QMK Programmability Provides Genuinely Deeper Customization Than a Manufacturer's Proprietary Software",
    "explanation": "VIA is an open-source configuration tool built on the QMK firmware standard, letting the Keychron K10 Pro's key remapping and macro data live in a widely supported, non-proprietary format rather than being locked into one company's specific software that could eventually stop receiving updates. This matters if you're the type of buyer who customizes key layouts extensively and wants confidence that your configuration approach remains supported long-term, less so if you plan to use the keyboard with its default layout indefinitely. Check whether a board's remapping software specifically mentions VIA or QMK support versus a closed proprietary driver before assuming all 'programmable' keyboards offer equivalent long-term customization flexibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated Battery Life Figures Depend Heavily on Backlight Usage and Should Be Compared Under the Same Conditions",
    "explanation": "The standard Keychron K10's stated 240-hour battery life is specifically measured with the backlight off, while the K10 Pro's 100-hour figure is measured at its lowest brightness setting rather than off entirely, meaning a direct comparison between these two numbers isn't quite apples-to-apples unless you account for that difference in testing conditions. This matters if extended cordless use between charges is a priority, where the actual real-world battery life you experience depends heavily on how much backlight brightness you typically run. Check the specific backlight condition a stated battery life figure was measured under before directly comparing two different keyboards' battery claims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Transparent Chassis Trades Some Structural Rigidity for a Distinctive Visual Design, a Real Tradeoff to Consider",
    "explanation": "The GravaStar Mercury K1 Lite's transparent PC chassis, while durable, generally can't match the rigidity of a solid aluminum or reinforced plastic case since transparent polycarbonate construction has different structural properties, though the listing does specifically state it maintains structural stability for everyday competitive play. This matters if you prioritize maximum case rigidity above all else, where a solid-case design might feel marginally more solid under aggressive typing, though the practical difference is unlikely to be dramatic for most users. Consider whether a distinctive transparent aesthetic is worth accepting slightly different structural properties compared to a traditional solid-case keyboard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Silent Switches Reduce Bottom-Out Noise Specifically, Not the Physical Act of Typing Entirely",
    "explanation": "The Keychron K8's Silent K Pro Red switches use internal dampeners specifically to reduce the clacking sound when a key bottoms out at the end of its travel, but they don't eliminate typing sound entirely, since finger contact with the keycap and the overall mechanical action still produce some audible noise. This matters if your expectation is a completely silent typing experience, which no genuine mechanical switch fully achieves, versus a realistic expectation of meaningfully quieter operation than a standard clicky or even standard linear switch. Set realistic expectations for 'silent' switches as meaningfully quieter rather than completely noiseless before making a purchase decision based on noise concerns alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sound-Absorbing Foam and a Steel Plate Together Change Both the Sound and the Perceived Typing Quality",
    "explanation": "The Keychron K10 Pro's combination of sound-absorbing foam, a silicone dampening bottom pad, and a steel plate work together to both reduce hollow resonance and add a subtle weightiness to the typing feel that the standard K10 without these additions doesn't replicate, even though both boards use similar switch types. This matters if the overall typing experience, not just the switch feel alone, is important to you, since the surrounding case construction meaningfully shapes how any given switch actually sounds and feels in practice. Consider that two keyboards with the same stated switch type can still feel and sound noticeably different based on the surrounding case and dampening construction."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the K10 Pro's VIA programmability work if I only ever use the keyboard on wireless mode?", "a": "You need to connect via wired USB-C mode to initially configure your key remapping and macros, but once set, the resulting keymap works on both wireless and wired modes going forward without needing to reconnect the cable each time." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing battery life figures across wireless keyboards?", "a": "Comparing two stated battery life numbers without checking whether they were measured under the same backlight conditions, since a figure measured with the backlight off isn't directly comparable to one measured at a low brightness setting." },
  { "q": "Is the Keychron K10 Pro worth it over the cheaper standard K10?", "a": "If you specifically want VIA programmability and refined sound dampening, yes, but if maximum battery life matters more and you don't need advanced remapping, the standard K10 covers that for about $7 less with significantly longer battery life." },
  { "q": "How durable is the GravaStar's transparent chassis compared to a standard plastic case?", "a": "The listing specifically states the polycarbonate construction maintains structural stability for everyday competitive play, though a transparent chassis generally has somewhat different structural properties than a solid aluminum or reinforced case." },
  { "q": "Can the Keychron K8's silent switches still be heard at all, or are they completely quiet?", "a": "They're meaningfully quieter than standard clicky or linear switches due to internal dampeners reducing bottom-out noise, but no genuine mechanical switch eliminates typing sound entirely, so expect noticeably quieter rather than completely silent operation." },
  { "q": "Do any of these keyboards support connecting to a phone or tablet in addition to a computer?", "a": "Yes, the Keychron K10, K10 Pro, K8, and GravaStar picks all support Bluetooth connectivity to multiple device types including phones and tablets, in addition to their wired or 2.4GHz computer connections." }
