    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",

    q: "How far does a typical teacher stipend actually go toward a printer?",
    a: "A district supply stipend commonly runs $100 to $200 a year, which rarely covers a printer plus a full year of cartridge ink bought new. An ink-tank printer like the HP Smart Tank 5101, which includes 2 years of ink, or a laser printer with low per-page toner cost, stretches that stipend much further than repeatedly buying inkjet cartridges.",

    q: "Can teachers deduct a printer purchase on their taxes?",
    a: "US educators can generally deduct up to $300 in out-of-pocket classroom expenses through the educator expense deduction, which can cover some or all of a printer bought for classroom materials. Keep your receipt and confirm current specifics with a tax professional.",

  {
    q: "What's the difference between color accuracy and color contrast for worksheets?",
    a: "Full color accuracy matters for photo printing, but educational worksheets mainly need color contrast, diagrams, charts, and color-coded sections staying clearly legible on the page. A color laser like the Brother HL-L3220CDW holds contrast more consistently than a budget color inkjet, which matters more for teaching materials than perfect photo-realistic color.",

  {
    q: "Is an automatic document feeder worth it for a teacher?",
    a: "If you regularly scan stacks of student work, signed forms, or reading logs for digital grading or record-keeping, yes. The Epson Workforce WF-2930 and HP OfficeJet Pro 8139 both include one and scan multi-page stacks in a single pass instead of one page at a time, a real time saver during grading periods.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my classroom or home printer survive sitting unused over school breaks?",
    a: "Cartridge-based inkjets are the most vulnerable to ink drying out over a multi-week break, wasting ink on cleaning cycles when you resume. Laser toner and ink-tank refills, used in picks like the DCP-L2640DW and Smart Tank 5101, hold up much better through winter, spring, or summer breaks without that waste.",
