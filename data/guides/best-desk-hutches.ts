      "The Furinno Classic 5-Shelf Desktop Hutch is the most reviewed desk hutch on Amazon, with nearly 40,000 ratings. It sits at 37 inches wide and provides five open shelves that hold books, files, and desk accessories without overhanging a standard 24-inch monitor footprint. The FSC-certified engineered wood construction is lightweight, making it easy to position or reposition without clearing the full desk.\n\nThe open-shelf format means there is no concealed storage, which suits people who prefer visual access to frequently used items over a tidy, closed look. Five shelves is a strong amount of tiered storage for the price range, and the 37-inch span accommodates monitors up to 24 inches wide with room on either side for peripherals or reference materials.",

The lightweight build makes it easy to move between desks or rooms. Five shelves at this price is better shelf-count-per-dollar than any other hutch in this list, though the lightweight construction reflects the price point.

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between an open shelf desk hutch and one with drawers?",
    a: "Open shelf hutches give immediate visual access to stored items and are easier to load and unload. Drawer hutches conceal items for a tidier appearance and protect small supplies from being knocked off. The ChooChoo and REIBII picks in this roundup combine both formats. Open shelf models dominate this category because they are lighter and less expensive.",
  },
  {
    q: "How wide should a desk hutch be for a 27-inch monitor?",
    a: "A 27-inch monitor with its stand typically spans 24 to 26 inches wide. A hutch 36 inches or wider will clear the monitor stand and still provide shelf space on either side. All picks in this roundup from the ChooChoo onward accommodate 27-inch monitors. The Snughome at 38.6 inches accommodates up to 28-inch monitors.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a desk hutch hold a monitor on top of it?",
    a: "Some desk hutches are designed as monitor risers with hutch shelves on either side. The picks in this roundup are freestanding hutch shelves positioned next to or behind a monitor, not as monitor bases. Placing a monitor directly on top of any of these hutches is not recommended without confirming the weight rating of the top surface.",

    q: "What is the best desk hutch for a dorm room?",
    a: "The Furinno Classic 5-Shelf at $17.13 is the best-value option for dorm rooms where budget and lightweight portability matter. The Furinno 37-inch model is better for a slightly larger dorm desk where more shelf space is needed. Both are easy to assemble and light enough to move without help.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which desk hutch has built-in outlets and USB charging?",
    a: "The HOOBRO Desktop Bookcase includes 2 AC outlets, 2 USB ports, and a built-in LED light strip. At $49.99 it is the only pick in this roundup with integrated power access. This is a practical feature for desk setups where adding a separate power strip is inconvenient or where cable management is a priority.",
