export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Mobile Scanner's Power Source Determines How Genuinely Portable It Really Is",
    "explanation": "The Brother DS-640 powers entirely through its USB 3.0 cable with no separate wall adapter needed, meaning it works anywhere you have a laptop, while a scanner requiring its own power brick effectively ties you to an outlet regardless of how small the scanner body itself is. Check whether a listing specifies USB-only power or includes a separate AC adapter as a required accessory, since this detail matters more for real-world portability than the scanner's stated weight alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Optical Resolution Above 1200 DPI Mainly Matters for Photo Work, Not Text Documents",
    "explanation": "The Epson V39 II's 4800 dpi optical resolution is dramatically higher than the 1200 DPI ceiling on the sheet-fed picks in this comparison, but that extra resolution mainly benefits enlarging or restoring fine photographic detail, not scanning a typed business letter. Buying based on the highest DPI number alone can mean overpaying for photo-grade resolution you'll never use if your actual need is everyday document digitization. Match the resolution tier to your actual use case rather than assuming higher is always better value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Simplex Scanning at This Price Tier Still Requires a Manual Second Pass for Two-Sided Pages",
    "explanation": "Both the Brother DS-640 and HP HPPS100 scan only one side of a page per pass, meaning a double-sided document requires manually flipping the page and running it through again, an extra step genuine duplex scanners eliminate. If you regularly handle two-sided paperwork, budget the extra time this manual step adds, or consider that a duplex-capable scanner typically appears at a higher price tier than this comparison covers. Check specifically for the word \"duplex\" in a listing rather than assuming any sheet-fed scanner captures both sides automatically."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Photo Restoration Features Are a Distinct Capability From Basic Photo Scanning",
    "explanation": "The Epson V39 II's Easy Photo Fix technology actively corrects faded colors in a single click, a genuinely different capability from simply capturing a high-resolution image of a photo as-is. A flatbed scanner without dedicated restoration software will still capture a faded photo accurately, just without automatically correcting the fading, so if restoring old, discolored prints is your specific goal, look for a listing that names a restoration feature explicitly rather than assuming high resolution alone accomplishes the same thing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Broader Operating System Compatibility Reduces Future Compatibility Risk",
    "explanation": "The Brother DS-640's iPrint&Scan software explicitly supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, a broader compatibility range than scanners whose software only lists Windows and Mac. This matters if your household or workplace has mixed operating systems, or if you might switch platforms later, since a scanner tied to specific software can become unusable after an OS change. Check the listing's stated compatible operating systems directly rather than assuming universal support."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the Brother DS-640 or HP HPPS100 scan both sides of a document automatically?", "a": "No, both are simplex, one-sided scanners, so scanning a two-sided document requires manually flipping the page and running it through a second time." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a photo scanner like the Epson V39 II?", "a": "Assuming its high 4800 dpi resolution is necessary for everyday document scanning, when in reality that resolution level is built specifically for photo detail and restoration, not typed text." },
  { "q": "Is the Brother DS-640 worth it over the cheaper HP HPPS100 pick?", "a": "If genuine portability and broad OS compatibility including Linux matter to you, yes, the Brother's lighter weight and USB-only power make it the more travel-ready choice, though the HP scans a slightly wider range of paper sizes." },
  { "q": "How do I get the best results from the Epson V39 II's Easy Photo Fix feature?", "a": "Use it specifically on faded or discolored older prints rather than already vibrant photos, since the one-click correction is designed to restore lost color, not enhance images that don't need it." },
  { "q": "Can the Canon Canoscan Lide 300 handle photo scanning as well as documents?", "a": "Yes, its Auto Scan Mode detects photos as well as documents, though its resolution and lack of dedicated restoration software mean it won't match the Epson V39 II's results on faded or damaged prints." },
  { "q": "Do any of these scanners work without installing dedicated software?", "a": "The Canon and Epson flatbeds both include their own scanning software for full functionality, and while basic scanning may work through generic drivers, using each product's bundled software is necessary to access features like Auto Scan Mode or Easy Photo Fix." }
