That single-pass capability matters directly for wood work: fewer passes means less char buildup along the cut edge and a cleaner finish without extra sanding.\n\nThe 17\" x 16\" open bed handles full cutting-board and sign-blank sizes without tiling smaller pieces together, and the all-aluminum frame with steel shaft rails keeps the beam tracking straight at speed, holding 0.004in accuracy.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rated Wood Cutting Depth, Not Just Wattage",
    "explanation": "Wattage alone doesn't predict how deep a machine cuts wood in one pass; look specifically for a stated cutting depth figure like 5mm, 12mm, or 20mm, since two 10W-rated machines in this lineup quote different maximum wood thicknesses. A machine that only lists general power without a cutting-depth figure is harder to plan a project around, since the buyer has to test rather than trust the spec sheet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Smoke, Char, and Fire Containment",
    "explanation": "Wood cutting produces more visible smoke and char buildup than acrylic or leather work on the same machine, and carries a real fire risk during longer cuts. A flame sensor that halts the job automatically, or a fully enclosed housing that contains sparks, is worth prioritizing for wood specifically even if it costs more or reduces available bed size, since retrofitting containment after a fire incident isn't an option."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bed Size Matched to Real Wood Projects",
    "explanation": "Match the working area to actual planned wood projects rather than the largest available bed: cutting boards and sign blanks need 16in-plus, small coasters and keychains fit an 8in bed comfortably, and cylindrical items like mugs or rolling pins need a rotary attachment regardless of flat-bed size. Buying a larger bed than projects require mostly adds footprint and cost without practical benefit for wood work specifically."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multiple Passes vs Single-Pass Cutting",
    "explanation": "Lower-power machines can still cut wood, but require two or more passes at the same settings, which adds real project time and can leave more visible char along the edge than a single deeper pass. Check whether the listed cutting depth assumes one pass or several before comparing two machines at similar prices, since a 5mm single-pass rating and a 5mm multi-pass rating are not equivalent in practice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Software and Offline Batch Operation",
    "explanation": "Wood sign and craft work often means running the same design repeatedly across multiple blanks, so offline SD/TF card operation or a saved-job touchscreen workflow matters more here than for one-off engraving. A phone app with AI design generation from a photo also removes the need to learn vector design software just to start a first wood project."

];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What laser power do I need to cut wood?",
    "a": "A 5-10W diode laser cuts thin basswood (3-5mm) in a single pass and thicker plywood (up to 12-20mm) in multiple passes or on higher-rated machines; below 5W, most diode lasers can engrave wood surfaces but struggle to cut through even thin stock."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a laser engraver leave burn marks on wood?",
    "a": "Yes, some char along the cut edge is normal with diode laser cutting; the depth of char depends on power, speed, and number of passes. Lower speed and higher power in a single pass generally leaves less visible char than multiple slow passes."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I engrave curved or cylindrical wood pieces like mugs?",
    "a": "Only with a rotary roller attachment, which rotates the cylindrical piece in sync with the laser head; a flat-bed-only machine cannot evenly engrave a curved wood surface without one, regardless of bed size."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need ventilation even with an enclosed laser engraver?",
    "a": "Yes. An enclosure contains smoke and sparks during the cutting process, but the machine still needs to vent that smoke outside or through a filter; enclosure alone does not eliminate the need for ventilation on wood specifically, which produces more particulate than acrylic or leather."
  },
  {
    "q": "What wood types work best with a diode laser engraver?",
    "a": "Basswood, birch plywood, and MDF cut and engrave most predictably due to consistent density; hardwoods like oak or walnut engrave well but cut more slowly and may need multiple passes even on a 10W machine, and resinous woods like pine can produce more visible char."
