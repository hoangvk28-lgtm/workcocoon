We ranked the picks below by real writing space rather than price or brand, since a board too small for your task list defeats the purpose regardless of how nice it looks.",
  "None of the listings in our research pool explicitly mention a pre-printed grid, column layout, or task template, so we're not claiming any of these boards ship with one. If a pre-templated task board (with printed columns like \"To Do / Doing / Done\") is specifically what you want, verify that via the product listing's images before buying rather than assuming a blank whiteboard includes one.",
