export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Newer Processing Chip Genuinely Changes Device Responsiveness, Not Just Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "The newest Echo Show 8's AZ3 Pro chip specifically enables Omnisense technology, personalizing routines based on temperature, presence, or visual ID detection, capabilities the previous-generation chip in the Like-New Echo Show 8 doesn't support regardless of the screen looking otherwise identical. This matters if you specifically want automated routines that respond to who's in the room or environmental conditions, features that depend on genuine processing power, not just software updates alone. Check whether a listing names a specific chip generation and what features that chip specifically unlocks before assuming any two similarly sized displays perform identically."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certified Refurbished Previous-Generation Devices Offer Real Savings Without Sacrificing Core Functionality",
    "explanation": "The Like-New Echo Show 8 still includes the same 8-inch screen size, spatial audio, and built-in smart home hub as the newest model, missing only the newest chip's advanced automation features, at roughly a third less than the current-generation price. This represents genuine value if the newest chip's specific capabilities, like Omnisense presence detection, aren't essential to your actual use case. Compare what specific features you'd actually lose by choosing a certified refurbished previous generation against the price difference, rather than assuming newest is always worth the premium."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Support Eliminates a Separate Smart Home Hub Purchase",
    "explanation": "Both Echo Show 8 picks in this comparison include a built-in smart home hub supporting these three common smart home protocols, meaning compatible devices, smart locks, sensors, and lights, connect directly without needing a separate standalone hub device that would otherwise add cost and complexity to your setup. The Echo Show 5 and Google Nest Hub picks in this comparison don't include this built-in hub capability, which matters specifically if you're building out a smart home system using devices that require Zigbee, Matter, or Thread connectivity. Check whether your planned smart home devices need one of these protocols specifically before assuming any smart display provides equivalent hub functionality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Adjustable Stand Bundle Solves a Real Positioning Problem a Fixed-Base Display Can't",
    "explanation": "The Echo Show 5 bundle's adjustable stand lets you angle the display for optimal viewing whether it's sitting on a nightstand, propped on a kitchen counter, or positioned on a desk, a genuine flexibility advantage over a fixed flat base that only offers one viewing angle. This matters more if you plan to move the device between locations or use it in a spot where the display's natural resting angle doesn't align well with your typical eye level. Consider your actual placement plans before assuming any smart display's fixed base will provide a comfortable viewing angle in every location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bulk Packaging on an Otherwise Identical Product Typically Reflects Genuine Cost Savings Without Functional Compromise",
    "explanation": "The bulk-packaged Google Nest Hub offers the identical hardware and software experience as a standard retail-boxed unit, with the packaging difference reflecting reduced retail presentation costs passed on as savings rather than any change to the device itself. This is a different situation from buying a used or refurbished unit, since bulk packaging simply means a plainer box, not a previously owned or repaired device. Check specifically whether a lower price reflects packaging differences alone versus a genuine used or refurbished condition, since these carry different practical implications for what you're actually receiving."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What does Omnisense technology actually do on the newest Echo Show 8?", "a": "It personalizes routines and responses based on detecting temperature, presence, or visual identification of who's in the room, a capability specifically enabled by the device's newer AZ3 Pro chip that the previous generation doesn't support." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing the newest and certified refurbished Echo Show 8?", "a": "Assuming the certified refurbished previous generation is a meaningfully worse device, when it actually retains the same screen size, spatial audio, and built-in smart home hub, losing only the newest chip's specific advanced automation features." },
  { "q": "Is the newest Echo Show 8 worth the price premium over the Like-New previous generation?", "a": "If Omnisense presence-based automation and the fastest available performance matter to you, yes, but if you want the same core screen size and smart home hub functionality for meaningfully less, the certified refurbished previous generation delivers that well." },
  { "q": "Does bulk packaging on the Google Nest Hub mean it's a different or lower-quality product?", "a": "No, it's the identical hardware and software experience as the standard retail-boxed version; bulk packaging simply reflects reduced retail presentation costs, not a functional or quality difference." },
  { "q": "Can the Echo Show 5's adjustable stand be purchased separately if I already own the display?", "a": "Yes, the adjustable stand with USB-C charging is also sold as a standalone accessory, though buying it bundled with the Echo Show 5 as shown in this comparison typically offers a combined savings over purchasing both separately." },
  { "q": "Do I need a smart home hub if I only plan to use basic Alexa voice commands without Zigbee or Matter devices?", "a": "No, if your smart home devices connect over standard WiFi and are Alexa-compatible without requiring Zigbee, Matter, or Thread specifically, a display without a built-in hub, like the Echo Show 5, handles that use case just as well as the hub-equipped Echo Show 8." }
