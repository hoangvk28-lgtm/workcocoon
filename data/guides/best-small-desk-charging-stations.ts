    whyItWins: "The Anker Nano 6-in-1 has the smallest footprint of any multi-function charging station we tested: 9.9 x 9.4 cm at the base. That is slightly smaller than a Post-it note. Despite that size, it delivers two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and two AC outlets -- making it the most capable charger per square centimeter in this roundup.",

  {
    question: "What is the smallest charging station that works for a small desk?",
    answer: "The Anker PowerPort 5 has one of the smallest footprints in this roundup. For multi-port with AC outlets included, the Anker Nano at 9.9 x 9.4 cm is the smallest option. Both fit in the charging zone of an 80 cm desk.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a small charging station charge a laptop?",
    answer: "Yes, if it has a USB-C port with Power Delivery (PD) at 65W or more. The Anker Nano 6-in-1 (67W), Anker 615 (65W), and Anker 525 (65W) all support laptop charging via USB-C PD. The Anker PowerPort 5 does not -- it maxes out at standard USB-A speeds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it better to have a flat or vertical charger on a small desk?",
    answer: "For desks under a shelf, flat (Anker Nano, Anker 615). For standard open desks, vertical (Anker 525) -- they feel less intrusive even at similar base dimensions because they grow upward rather than across. See the full comparison in the guide above.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I keep cables tidy with a small desk charging station?",
    answer: "Use short 30 cm cables, route them along the desk's back edge with adhesive clips, and place the charger in a back corner rather than beside your keyboard. See the setup tips section above for the full approach.",
  },
  {
    question: "What charging station fits on a 60 cm desk?",
    answer: "A 60 cm desk leaves roughly 10 cm of charging zone beside the keyboard. The Anker PowerPort 5 and Anker Nano 6-in-1 (9.9 cm base) are the best options. Alternatively, mount a charger under the desk or on the desk's side edge to free up the surface entirely.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a wireless charging pad for a small desk?",
    answer: "Only if you're in an Apple ecosystem and want to eliminate phone, watch, and AirPods cables. The Anker MagSafe 3-in-1 Qi2 removes three cables in exchange for one clean stand. For mixed ecosystems or laptop-inclusive setups, a compact wired charger with short cables is usually the cleaner solution.",
