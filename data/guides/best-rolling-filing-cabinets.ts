    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best rolling filing cabinets in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Do all filing cabinets marketed for home offices actually roll?", a: "No. Not every cabinet that shows up in a rolling filing cabinet search ships with casters. Check the specific listing for the words 'mobile,' 'rolling,' or 'casters' rather than assuming. In this guide, several strong picks are stationary and included as honest alternatives, not substitutes for a genuinely rolling cabinet." },
  { q: "What caster material is best for hardwood floors?", a: "Rubber or polyurethane casters are generally safer for hardwood since they roll quietly and are less likely to scratch the finish. Hard nylon casters can mark hardwood and tend to be noisier on hard flooring, though they hold up well under load on carpet or tile." },
  { q: "Is a 5-caster base actually more stable than 4 casters?", a: "Generally yes. A 5-caster layout, with one wheel centered underneath the cabinet, resists tipping better on uneven floors or rug edges than a standard 4-caster arrangement. Most budget rolling cabinets use 4 casters, so a 5-caster design is worth prioritizing if the cabinet will be moved often." },
  { q: "Can a filing cabinet's casters fail before the cabinet itself wears out?", a: "Yes. A cabinet's stated overall weight capacity doesn't guarantee each individual caster is rated to match. Casters bear only a fraction of the total load each, and on a heavily loaded cabinet they're often the first component to fail, especially under-rated budget hardware." },
  { q: "Does a lock on a rolling filing cabinet make it more secure than a stationary one?", a: "No. Lock security is unrelated to whether a cabinet has casters. A basic cam lock included on either a rolling or stationary cabinet functions the same way and mainly deters casual access rather than providing real security. Don't factor rolling ability into your security expectations." },
