    q: "What is the difference between a vintage desk and a mid-century modern desk?",
    a: "Vintage broadly refers to furniture with an older aesthetic (1920s-1980s). Mid-century modern is a specific design movement from approximately 1945-1969, characterized by clean lines, tapered legs, organic materials, and Scandinavian-influenced minimalism. On Amazon, both terms are used loosely to describe any desk with a retro aesthetic. True vintage pieces from the MCM era are not sold on Amazon - they are found at estate sales, auction houses, and specialty vintage dealers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is walnut in an Amazon desk listing actually walnut wood?",
    a: "Almost never at prices under $600. Walnut in most Amazon furniture listings describes a color finish - walnut-toned laminate, veneer, or stain applied to a different wood species or MDF. Genuine solid walnut desks start at $800+ from quality woodworkers. If a listing at $200 says walnut desk, it means walnut-colored, not walnut-species.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes tapered legs mid-century modern?",
    a: "Tapered legs are a defining element of MCM furniture. The taper (wider at top, narrowing toward the floor) creates a visual lightness - the desk appears to float rather than sit heavily on the floor. This was a deliberate design move in post-war furniture to contrast with the heavy ornate Victorian and Edwardian furniture that preceded it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do MCM desks suit apartments and small rooms?",
    a: "MCM desks have low visual weight - tapered legs create floor clearance, the horizontal profile reduces visual bulk, and the lack of overhead hutches keeps the ceiling line clear. In a small room, this makes the desk recede visually rather than dominate. Compared to a traditional executive desk with skirting panels and a hutch, an MCM desk in the same room makes the space feel significantly more open.",
