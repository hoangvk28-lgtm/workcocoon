export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Can any USB-C dock give my Chromebook a second monitor?",
    a: "No. Most Chromebooks support only one external display natively through USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode. Adding a second monitor reliably requires a dock built around a DisplayLink chipset, like the Plugable 12-in-1 Chromebook Certified pick, plus installing the DisplayLink for ChromeOS extension from the Chrome Web Store.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do Chromebooks need a 100W or higher power delivery dock?",
    a: "No. Most Chromebooks charge at 45-65W maximum, so a 60-65W dock like the Plugable 12-in-1 or the Plugable UD-MSTH2 already covers real charging needs. Higher-wattage docks aren't harmful, but that extra capacity mainly benefits a household also docking a higher-power Windows or Mac laptop on the same unit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do Android apps look wrong on my external monitor when docked?",
    a: "This is a known Chrome OS behavior, not a dock issue. When a Chromebook in tablet or tent mode connects to an external display, Android apps running through the Play Store layer can fail to resize correctly for the larger screen. Switching the Chromebook to standard clamshell mode before docking usually fixes it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a Thunderbolt-rated dock work better on any Chromebook?",
    a: "Only on Chromebooks that actually have a Thunderbolt 4 port, a small but growing category of premium models. On a standard USB-C Alt Mode Chromebook, a Thunderbolt dock still works but is limited to Alt Mode speeds and display output, so its extra bandwidth goes unused.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my webcam cut out during a video call on a docked Chromebook?",
    a: "Chrome OS allocates USB bandwidth for webcams and microphones differently than Windows does, and running a webcam through the same hub layer that's driving an external display via DisplayLink can create bandwidth contention. Plugging the webcam into a direct USB-A port on the dock rather than a shared USB-C hub port typically resolves the dropout.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a Chromebook-certified dock worth paying more for?",
    a: "If dual external displays or classroom-scale reliability matter, yes. The Plugable 12-in-1 is the only pick in this list explicitly Chromebook certified, meaning its DisplayLink implementation and charging behavior have been verified against Chrome OS specifically rather than assumed compatible because it lists ChromeOS support generically.",
