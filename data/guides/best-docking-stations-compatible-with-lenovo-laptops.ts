  "Finding a docking station compatible with Lenovo laptops means sorting through more variety than most buyers expect, since Lenovo has shipped multiple physically distinct ThinkPad dock generations that aren't interchangeable, older slide-in mechanical docks, then the ThinkPad USB-C Dock Gen 2 era, and now the current ThinkPad Universal USB-C Dock and Universal Thunderbolt 4 Dock. Matching the dock generation to your specific ThinkPad model year matters more than just looking for the Lenovo name.\n\nBelow are 8 docking stations we evaluated on official Lenovo compatibility, third-party alternative value, port count, and power delivery, ranging from a renewed official Lenovo dock at $59.99 to a 14-port third-party Thunderbolt option built for buyers who want more flexibility than Lenovo's own docks offer.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Will any Lenovo docking station work with any ThinkPad laptop?",
    a: "No. Lenovo has shipped multiple physically distinct, non-interchangeable dock generations, the older mechanical slide-in ThinkPad Dock, the USB-C Dock Gen 2 era, and the current Universal USB-C Dock and Universal Thunderbolt 4 Dock. Always check your specific ThinkPad model year against Lenovo's compatibility list rather than assuming any Lenovo-branded dock fits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a third-party dock as good as an official Lenovo dock for a ThinkPad?",
    a: "For display and data, generally yes. But official Lenovo docks are validated specifically against Lenovo's own power management firmware, deeper sleep/wake handling and battery threshold settings, which third-party docks don't always replicate exactly. If precise wake-from-sleep or lid-close docking behavior matters to you, an official dock like the ThinkPad Universal USB-C Dock is the safer choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it safe to buy a renewed Lenovo docking station?",
    a: "Renewed official Lenovo docks are a legitimate way to get official hardware at a lower price. The main thing to confirm before buying is whether the listing includes the original power brick, since a third-party replacement power brick is the most common complaint with used official docks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a Thunderbolt dock for my ThinkPad, or is USB-C enough?",
    a: "It depends on your ThinkPad's actual port. If it has a genuine Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 port, a certified Thunderbolt dock like the Plugable TBT-UDM guarantees compatibility through Intel's certification process. USB4 docks are broadly compatible but aren't held to that same certified standard, so a certified pick removes some guesswork if your ThinkPad supports it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why isn't my ThinkPad charging at full speed through the dock?",
    a: "A dock rated for a given wattage typically delivers about 10-15W less to the laptop once its own circuitry draws its share. This matters most on ThinkPad P-series workstation laptops that need 100-170W under load, which may not charge at full speed from a dock rated lower than that real requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "My ThinkPad's external display keeps flickering or dropping the USB connection through the dock. What should I check first?",
    a: "Check for a dock firmware update first, Lenovo regularly releases fixes for exactly these display flicker and USB dropout issues. Also check whether you're running dual displays plus a fast file transfer plus a USB drive simultaneously, which can saturate the dock's USB bus and cause disconnects that look like a hardware fault but are really a bandwidth issue.",
