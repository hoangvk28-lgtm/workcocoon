    "criterion": "Understand that response time (GtG) affects visible motion clarity as much as refresh rate does",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate (how many times per second the image updates) and response time (how quickly individual pixels can change color, commonly measured in milliseconds as gray-to-gray or GtG) are two separate specs that both affect how smooth and clear fast motion looks, and a high refresh rate paired with a slow response time still produces visible ghosting or blur trailing behind fast-moving objects, since the panel can't physically change pixel colors fast enough to keep up with the higher refresh rate's demands.\n\nThis matters because response time is disclosed far less consistently than refresh rate across portable monitor listings, many simply omit it entirely, making direct comparison difficult even when two panels share the same headline refresh number.\n\nCheck specifically for a stated GtG response time in milliseconds, and treat a genuinely high refresh rate spec with some skepticism if the listing doesn't also disclose response time, since the refresh number alone doesn't guarantee smooth-looking motion."

    "criterion": "Check power delivery and cable requirements, since a portable monitor's convenience depends on how it's actually powered",
    "explanation": "Portable monitors typically draw power either through the same USB-C cable carrying the video signal (single-cable operation, the more convenient setup) or through a separate dedicated power input, and some models support pass-through charging that lets your laptop's own charger power both the laptop and the monitor simultaneously through one connection.\n\nThis matters concretely for actual portability: a monitor requiring two separate cables (one for video, one for power) is meaningfully less convenient to set up and pack away than genuine single-cable operation, undermining part of the appeal of a \"portable\" monitor in the first place.\n\nCheck specifically whether the monitor supports single-cable USB-C operation with your source device, and confirm pass-through charging wattage if you want your laptop's charger to power both devices without needing two outlets."

  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since this category includes both established models and many newer, similar-looking entrants",
    "explanation": "Portable monitors from well-established sellers with years of accumulated sales carry review counts in the thousands, giving genuine statistical confidence in panel quality and long-term reliability, while newer listings, sometimes from the same manufacturer under a different model number or from less established brands entirely, can carry only a handful of reviews despite looking similarly specified and priced.\n\nThis is a real practical concern for a portable monitor specifically because panel defects (dead pixels, backlight bleed, uneven brightness) are a documented failure mode across this category, and a thin review base provides much less confidence that a specific listing's panel quality is consistent across units.\n\nWhen comparing two similarly specified and priced portable monitors, check both the star rating and the review count together, and treat a very small review count as a reason for extra caution even if the rating itself looks strong."

  { q: "Can I get 165Hz over HDMI on a portable monitor?", a: "Generally no. HDMI 2.0's bandwidth ceiling typically supports around 1080p144 but falls short of 165Hz at most resolutions. You'll need USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode to reach 165Hz on the panels in this guide." },
  { q: "Is 165Hz noticeably smoother than 144Hz?", a: "Only if your source device (laptop GPU, gaming rig) can sustain frame rates well above 144fps. Many thin-and-light gaming laptops and handheld PCs can't get there, making the extra 21Hz imperceptible in practice." },
  { q: "What's the difference between a native 165Hz panel and an overclocked one?", a: "A native 165Hz panel is designed to run at that rate from the factory. An overclocked panel reaches 165Hz through a manufacturer firmware push beyond its native 144Hz rating, which can introduce flicker or instability a native panel wouldn't show." },
  { q: "Why did my 165Hz monitor drop to a lower refresh rate with no warning?", a: "Most likely a cable issue. A USB-C cable that's DP Alt Mode-certified but low-bandwidth can silently bottleneck the connection. Use the cable included with the monitor or one explicitly certified for your resolution and refresh rate." },
