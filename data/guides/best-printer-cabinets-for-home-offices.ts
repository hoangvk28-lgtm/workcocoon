    "explanation": "Listings for a printer cabinet often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer cabinet holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer cabinet over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer cabinet you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A printer cabinet that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "Do these printer cabinets have doors to hide the printer?",
    a: "No. All 8 picks in this list are open-top file cabinets or printer stands with a flat surface for the printer, not fully enclosed cabinets with doors. If a hidden printer behind doors is a hard requirement, look for a dedicated enclosed cabinet and confirm it has a vent slot or rear grommet hole before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does ventilation matter for a printer cabinet?",
    a: "Laser printers generate heat and trace amounts of ozone during operation, and even inkjets need some air circulation to avoid trapping moisture. A fully sealed cabinet without any airflow path can shorten a printer's working life over time. Every pick in this list avoids the issue by being open-top rather than enclosed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I close a cabinet door while the printer is actively printing?",
    a: "It's not recommended with most enclosed cabinets, since closing the door during a print job can cause paper jams or block access to the output tray. A cabinet with a paper passthrough slot solves this, but it's a specific feature worth checking for, most enclosed cabinets on the market don't include one.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much interior height do I need for an all-in-one printer with a scanner lid?",
    a: "Budget roughly 12-15 extra inches of clearance above the printer's closed height to account for the scanner lid opening upward. Measure your printer with the lid open, not just its resting footprint, especially if you're considering pairing it with a fully enclosed cabinet down the line.",

    q: "How much noise reduction does an enclosed printer cabinet actually provide?",
    a: "Realistically, an estimated 5-10 dB reduction for a printer in the 40-55 dB range, enough to notice but not enough to make a loud laser printer silent. Treat noise reduction as a secondary benefit of an enclosed cabinet, not the main reason to buy one.",

    q: "What's the difference between a file cabinet and a true printer cabinet?",
    a: "A file cabinet, like most picks in this list, has an open top with drawers underneath, so the printer sits visible on top while documents stay stored below. A true printer cabinet encloses the printer behind doors. Both give you a stable, printer-ready surface, but only the enclosed version actually hides the printer from view.",
