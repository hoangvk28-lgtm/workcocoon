export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Genuine Duplex Scanning Requires Simultaneous Two-Sided Capture, Not Just Two-Sided Paper Handling",
    "explanation": "The Canon imageFORMULA R10 captures both sides of a page in a single feed pass using two internal sensors, a real time-saver over a simplex scanner where you manually flip the page and run it through twice. Some listings use ambiguous language like \"two-sided\" without clarifying whether that means true simultaneous duplex capture or simply that the scanner can physically accept a page in either orientation. Look specifically for the word \"duplex\" alongside a stated scan speed for both sides, since that combination confirms genuine simultaneous capture rather than a manual workaround."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Document Feeder Capacity Determines How Much Manual Babysitting a Multi-Page Scan Job Needs",
    "explanation": "The Canon R10's 20-sheet automatic feeder lets you load a stack and walk away, while a scanner without an ADF, like the Epson ES-50 in this comparison, requires you to feed each page individually even though it scans that single page quickly. If you regularly scan multi-page documents rather than one-off single sheets, the feeder capacity number matters more than the per-page scan speed alone. Check the specific sheet count stated for the automatic feeder, not just whether a feeder exists at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum Supported Page Length Varies Far More Than Most Buyers Expect",
    "explanation": "The Epson ES-50 explicitly supports pages up to 72 inches long, useful for scanning long receipts or oversized documents, while the other picks in this comparison cap out around 14 inches, standard for typical office paperwork. If your actual use case includes unusually long, narrow items like register receipts or architectural strip drawings, this spec matters more than any other in the entire comparison. Check the maximum page length explicitly stated in a listing rather than assuming any mobile scanner handles extra-long paper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Manufacturer-Stated Daily Scan Volume Signals the Duty Cycle a Scanner Is Actually Built For",
    "explanation": "The Canon R10 lists a suggested daily volume of 500 scans, a figure aimed at light personal or small-office use rather than a high-volume commercial operation running thousands of scans daily. Exceeding a manufacturer's suggested duty cycle regularly can shorten a scanner's working lifespan even if it doesn't fail immediately. Check whether a listing states a suggested or maximum daily volume, and compare that figure honestly against your actual expected usage before assuming any mobile scanner can handle heavy daily throughput."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wide Paper Size Acceptance Ranges Matter More If You Scan Cards or Receipts Alongside Standard Documents",
    "explanation": "The HP HPPS100 explicitly accepts paper from 2 by 2.9 inches up to 8.5 by 14 inches, a wider range than scanners built primarily around standard letter-sized documents. This matters if your scanning needs mix small items like business cards or receipts with standard paperwork, since a scanner not rated for small formats can jam or produce a poor scan on undersized paper. Check the specific minimum and maximum paper dimensions stated in a listing rather than assuming any document scanner handles small-format items equally well."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the Canon imageFORMULA R10 require driver installation to work?", "a": "No, its scanning software is built in and requires no separate installation, so it's ready to use as soon as you connect it via USB." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing duplex and simplex mobile scanners?", "a": "Assuming a higher per-page scan speed on a simplex scanner outweighs duplex capability, when in reality a duplex scanner often finishes a stack of two-sided documents faster overall since it eliminates the need for a manual second pass." },
  { "q": "Is the Canon imageFORMULA R10 worth the price jump over the Brother DS-640?", "a": "If you regularly scan two-sided documents, yes, the genuine duplex feeder and 20-sheet capacity save real time, but if you mostly scan single-sided pages occasionally, the Brother DS-640 covers that need at a lower price." },
  { "q": "How do I scan an unusually long document like a register receipt with these scanners?", "a": "The Epson ES-50 is specifically rated for pages up to 72 inches long, making it the only pick in this comparison suited to that task, since the other scanners cap out around standard letter or legal length." },
  { "q": "Can the HP HPPS100 handle small items like business cards without jamming?", "a": "Yes, its stated minimum paper size of 2 by 2.9 inches specifically covers small-format items like business cards and receipts, a wider range than a scanner built only for standard letter-sized paper." },
  { "q": "Is the Canon R10 suitable for high-volume daily scanning in a busy office?", "a": "Its manufacturer-suggested daily volume of 500 scans is aimed at light office or personal use, so a much higher-volume commercial operation should look toward a desktop-class scanner built for heavier duty cycles instead." }
