export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Genuine Pure Sine Wave Output Prevents Subtle, Long-Term Damage That Simulated Sine Wave Can Cause",
    "explanation": "The APC BR1500MS2 specifically delivers pure sine wave power, a smooth, continuous waveform matching what utility power grids actually provide, while simulated sine wave technology approximates this using a stepped voltage pattern that can cause certain sensitive electronics, particularly modern power supplies and precision equipment, to run less efficiently, generate more heat, or experience accelerated wear over years of use on battery power. This distinction matters most for genuinely sensitive or expensive equipment you plan to protect long-term, since the difference may not cause immediate visible problems but can contribute to shortened component lifespan over time. Check specifically for pure sine wave language, not just PFC compatibility, when protecting your most sensitive or valuable electronics."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PFC Compatibility and Pure Sine Wave Output Are Related But Distinct Technical Considerations",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD's PFC sinewave output specifically ensures compatibility with active PFC power supplies without necessarily delivering the same pure, unstepped waveform as genuine pure sine wave technology, meaning it solves the PFC compatibility problem without providing every benefit pure sine wave output offers for other sensitive components. This distinction matters because a listing emphasizing PFC compatibility addresses one specific concern, avoiding shutdown or buzzing issues with active PFC power supplies, while a listing emphasizing pure sine wave addresses a broader waveform quality concern affecting multiple types of sensitive electronics. Understand which specific problem you're solving for, PFC power supply compatibility or overall waveform quality, before assuming these terms are interchangeable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Explicitly Stated Connected Equipment Warranty Dollar Amount Is More Verifiable Than a Listing Without One",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD and CP1500AVRLCD3 both explicitly state a $500,000 Connected Equipment Guarantee, while the APC BR1500MS2's listing doesn't specify a dollar amount for its equipment protection despite likely offering some form of coverage, making direct comparison harder without that explicit figure. This doesn't necessarily mean the APC pick offers less protection, but it does mean you have less documented information to evaluate that specific aspect before purchase. Check for an explicitly stated dollar amount when comparing connected equipment warranties, and consider contacting the manufacturer directly if a listing doesn't specify this figure but you want that information before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Near-Identical Runtime and Capacity at a Meaningfully Lower Price Represents Genuine Value, Not a Compromise",
    "explanation": "The APC BX1500M's 68-minute runtime at 100W load comes remarkably close to the pure sine wave APC BR1500MS2's 73 minutes, while costing roughly $110 less, demonstrating that the premium for pure sine wave output specifically, not overall capacity, accounts for most of that price difference. If pure sine wave output isn't a specific requirement for your equipment, the BX1500M delivers nearly equivalent practical runtime and capacity at meaningfully better value. Compare runtime and capacity figures directly across your shortlist rather than assuming the most expensive option always delivers proportionally better core performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Coax and Ethernet Protection Appears on Two of Four Picks in This Comparison, Making It a Genuine Differentiator Worth Checking",
    "explanation": "Both APC picks in this comparison, the BR1500MS2 and BX1500M, include built-in coaxial and Ethernet surge protection, while neither CyberPower pick in this comparison specifically states this feature, meaning your choice between the APC and CyberPower options genuinely depends on whether you need this specific data line coverage. This isn't simply a matter of one brand being generally more feature-rich, since the CyberPower picks compensate with other advantages like explicitly stated higher-dollar warranties and USB charging ports. Weigh this specific feature against your actual wired connection types rather than assuming either brand is comprehensively superior across every dimension."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is pure sine wave output necessary for a typical home office computer setup?", "a": "For most standard computer setups, PFC sinewave or simulated sine wave output works perfectly well, and pure sine wave output specifically benefits sensitive modern electronics or equipment where the manufacturer explicitly recommends clean power, so it's not a strict necessity for every buyer." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing PFC compatibility and pure sine wave output?", "a": "Assuming these terms mean the same thing, when PFC compatibility specifically addresses active PFC power supply support while pure sine wave addresses broader waveform quality, and a UPS can offer one without necessarily providing the other." },
  { "q": "Is the APC BR1500MS2 worth the price premium over the APC BX1500M given their similar runtime?", "a": "If genuine pure sine wave output specifically matters for your sensitive electronics, yes, but if you just need strong capacity and built-in coax/Ethernet protection without that specific waveform quality, the BX1500M delivers nearly identical practical performance for about $110 less." },
  { "q": "Does a UPS without built-in coax and Ethernet protection leave my internet connection completely unprotected?", "a": "It leaves that specific connection type unprotected by the UPS itself, though you could add a separate coax or Ethernet surge protector alongside a UPS lacking this built-in feature if that protection matters for your setup." },
  { "q": "How much does the $500,000 connected equipment guarantee on the CyberPower picks actually matter for a typical home office?", "a": "For most home office setups, this level of coverage exceeds what's likely needed, but it does provide substantial documented financial assurance if you're protecting genuinely expensive or business-critical equipment where potential damage costs would be significant." },
  { "q": "Can I run a home theater or gaming PC setup on any of these UPS units without issues?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison offer 1500VA capacity suitable for a gaming PC or home theater setup, though if your power supply specifically uses active PFC, the CP1500PFCLCD or either APC pick would provide the safest compatibility match." }
