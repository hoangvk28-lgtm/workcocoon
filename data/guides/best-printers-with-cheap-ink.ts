    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer with cheap ink holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer with cheap ink over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Why does my printer's real ink cost feel higher than advertised?",
    a: "Manufacturer cost-per-page figures use an ISO test standard of roughly 5 percent page coverage, essentially plain text with wide margins. Real home printing, forms, graphs, and colorful worksheets often runs 10 to 20 percent coverage, so actual cost per page can run 2 to 4 times higher than the number on the box.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is HP Instant Ink worth it for cheap ink?",
    a: "It depends on how predictable your volume is. Instant Ink can lower cost per page for steady, matched usage, but canceling the subscription can remotely disable your cartridges, and printing beyond your plan's allowance triggers overage fees. For variable or unpredictable printing habits, an outright ink-tank printer avoids these risks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I safely use third-party ink to save even more?",
    a: "It depends on the brand. HP has a documented history of blocking non-HP ink through firmware updates, while Brother and Canon tend to be more tolerant. For the ink-tank printers in this list, most of the savings already come from the tank system itself, so third-party ink matters less here than for a standard cartridge printer.",

    q: "Should I buy standard or high-yield XL cartridges?",
    a: "High-yield XL cartridges cost more upfront but meaningfully less per page than standard cartridges, so they typically pay back the price difference within a few refill cycles for anyone printing regularly. For the printers in this guide specifically, ink-tank refills already undercut both options.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast do ink-tank printers pay back their higher upfront price?",
    a: "It depends on volume and coverage. At light use (under 100 pages a month), payback against a comparable cartridge printer typically takes 6 to 12 months. At 400 or more pages a month with heavier ink coverage, payback often happens in under 3 months.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Epson EcoTank and Canon MegaTank ink bottles interchangeable?",
    a: "No. Each brand uses its own bottle design and tank layout, so you can't substitute one brand's ink bottles for the other's printer. Factor local retail availability of your specific brand's ink into your decision if convenient restocking matters to you.",
  },
