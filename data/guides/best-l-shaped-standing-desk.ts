      "The Casaottima is a straightforward electric L-shaped standing desk at 63 inches, priced under $200, which undercuts most of the electric L-shaped picks in this guide by a meaningful margin. For buyers who want a sit-stand corner desk without paying for drawers, monitor shelves, or premium finishes, this is the leanest path to that 63-inch electric footprint. The black finish is neutral enough to fit most home office setups without a strong aesthetic commitment either way.\n\nBecause it skips built-in storage and extra features, it is best evaluated on the core mechanics: electric height adjustment and a 63-inch main run, matched against a real budget rather than a feature checklist.",

    a: "Type A is a full electric L where both sides rise together when you press the button. Type B has a motorized main section but a fixed-height return that stays at sitting height when you stand. All seven picks on this list are Type A. Many listings labeled L-shaped standing desk on Amazon are actually Type B - the listing photos do not always make this clear. Verify before purchasing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does an L-shaped standing desk need a corner space?",
    a: "Yes. An L-shaped desk requires two perpendicular walls in a corner configuration. The desk occupies a corner rectangle equal to its two leg measurements. For a VIVO 63x55\" desk, you need at least 63\" of clear wall on one side and 55\" on the adjacent wall, plus aisle clearance in front of the chair on each open side.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the corner dead zone on an L-shaped desk?",
    a: "The corner section of any L-shaped desk - approximately 12 to 18 inches from the corner joint in each direction - is awkward to use as primary workspace. Items placed there require a reach that creates shoulder and neck strain over time. The corner section is best used for a monitor arm base, a printer, a cable routing hub, or reference materials that require only occasional access.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are L-shaped standing desks less stable than straight standing desks?",
    a: "More surface mass distributed farther from the motor column creates more torque when the desk is at maximum height. The corner joint is also a mechanical connection point - if it flexes, movement amplifies at the ends of both sections. Dual-motor L-shaped frames handle this better than single-motor alternatives. All picks on this list include steel frame construction and anti-collision detection to minimize stress on the corner joint.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use an L-shaped standing desk in a room without a corner?",
    a: "Technically yes - you can place an L-shaped desk against a single straight wall with one leg extending into the room. In practice, this wastes the main advantage of the L-shape, takes up more floor space than a straight desk of equivalent primary work surface width, and the perpendicular leg becomes a space obstacle. If you do not have a corner, a straight 55\" or 60\" desk is almost always the better layout.",
