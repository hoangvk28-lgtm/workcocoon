The drawer pulls out from the front center and holds notebooks, chargers, or office supplies. USB-A and USB-C charging ports are embedded in the drawer panel. It is the most feature-complete glass standing desk at this price. The pedestal base takes only 15 minutes to assemble compared to 4-leg frame assembly. The glass top is 10mm thick and rated for 110 lbs. FLEXISPOT's 2-year warranty covers the motor and the frame. For a home office or executive desk with a clean visual presence, the Comhar is the default recommendation. Pedestal base assembles in 15 minutes.

    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best glass standing desks in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best glass standing desks in 2026 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Are glass standing desks safe?", a: "Yes. All glass standing desks sold through major retailers use tempered safety glass, which is 4 to 5 times stronger than standard glass and rated for the stated weight capacity. When tempered glass fails, it breaks into small rounded pieces rather than sharp shards. Glass desk failures are rare when used within the stated weight limits. Avoid placing objects that concentrate impact force (such as a heavy monitor stand with a small base) on the center of the glass without a support bracket." },
  { q: "Do glass desks wobble more than wood desks?", a: "Glass desks wobble in the same ways as any standing desk at their price range, driven by the frame quality rather than the glass itself. A glass desk on a dual-motor frame will be more stable than a glass desk on a single-motor frame. The glass top adds weight that can slightly reduce high-frequency vibration. Pedestal-base glass desks (single column) are generally less stable under side load than 4-leg frame glass desks." },
  { q: "Can I write on a glass standing desk?", a: "On white glass or frosted dry-erase glass desks (Marsail, YDN), yes. Standard dry-erase markers write and erase cleanly. On clear glass, dry-erase markers also technically work and erase, but the writing is only clearly visible from certain angles due to the transparent surface behind it. For a functional whiteboard desk, choose a white or frosted glass surface specifically labeled as dry-erase." },
  { q: "How do I reduce fingerprints on a glass desk?", a: "A few drops of glass cleaner (or white vinegar diluted with water) on a microfiber cloth removes fingerprints completely. For daily maintenance, a quick dry microfiber wipe takes 20 seconds. Avoid paper towels which can leave lint. For a lower-maintenance option, switch to a frosted glass model, which diffuses fingerprints and shows them much less under overhead lighting." },
  { q: "What weight can I put on a glass standing desk?", a: "Most glass standing desks are rated between 110 and 176 lbs. This capacity covers the entire surface, not per-item. A common dual-monitor setup (two 27-inch monitors at 15 lbs each, plus a laptop at 5 lbs, keyboard, and mouse pad) totals roughly 40 to 50 lbs, well within any model here. Avoid placing a full desktop PC tower directly on the glass unless the total load remains under the rated capacity with margin." },
