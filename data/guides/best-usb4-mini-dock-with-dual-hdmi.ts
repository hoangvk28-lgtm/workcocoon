  "We compared this lineup on MST support and its platform limitations, total data transfer speed, and included charging capability, since one listing specifically warns that without MST support, connected monitors will show identical mirrored content rather than extending your workspace."

  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Stream Transport Only Delivers Independent Dual Displays on Windows, Not macOS or Chrome OS",
    "explanation": "The j5create pick's MST technology specifically enables two independent 4K displays at 60Hz, but its own listing discloses that MST is not currently supported by macOS or Chrome OS, meaning Mac and Chromebook users connecting through this dock will see identical mirrored content on both monitors rather than an extended workspace. This matters significantly if you're a Mac or Chrome OS user expecting independent extended displays from any dual-HDMI mini dock, and matters less if you're exclusively on Windows where MST works as intended. Check whether a mini dock's dual-display technology specifically relies on MST before assuming it will deliver independently extended (not just mirrored) displays on your specific operating system."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Native GPU Video Output Avoids the Platform-Specific Limitations That MST-Based Solutions Carry",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick specifically uses direct GPU performance with no software or compression dependency, a fundamentally different technical approach from MST-based splitting that results in more consistent dual-display behavior across both Windows and Mac platforms, as evidenced by its detailed per-chip Mac compatibility documentation. This matters if cross-platform consistency matters to you, particularly if you switch between Mac and Windows devices with the same dock, and matters less if you exclusively use one platform where either approach would work equally well. Check whether a dock's dual-display technology is described as native GPU output versus MST-based splitting if you need consistent behavior across different operating systems."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Mini Dock's Actual Wall Charger May Not Be Included Despite a Stated High Charging Wattage",
    "explanation": "The Anker pick specifically states 100W input and 85W output charging capability but explicitly notes the wall charger itself is not included in the package, meaning you need to already own or separately purchase a compatible high-wattage USB-C charger to actually achieve that stated charging performance. This matters when comparing total cost across mini docks, where a cheaper dock lacking an included charger might require an additional purchase to match a pricier dock's complete out-of-box charging capability, and matters less if you already own a suitable high-wattage charger. Check whether a listing's stated charging wattage requires a separately purchased charger before assuming the dock alone delivers that full charging capability out of the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Genuinely Extra-Long Cable Reduces Physical Port Strain on Specific Laptop Form Factors",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick specifically includes an 11-inch attached cable designed to provide long reach and prevent the dock from dangling directly off the host laptop's port, a detail specifically called out as beneficial for 2-in-1 convertible laptops or laptops mounted on riser stands where a short, rigid dock connection could stress the port over time. This matters if you use a convertible laptop or a laptop riser stand where cable slack genuinely matters for physical stability, and matters less if your laptop sits flat on a desk where a shorter, more compact dock connection poses no practical issue. Consider your specific laptop setup (convertible, riser-mounted, or flat desk use) before assuming any mini dock's cable length is equally suitable for your physical arrangement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "1080p Resolution Caps Are a Real Limitation Worth Comparing Against 4K-Capable Picks at Similar Prices",
    "explanation": "The Anker pick specifically caps its dual-screen extension at 1080p@60Hz resolution, meaningfully lower than the 4K support offered by the UGREEN, StarTech, and j5create picks, a genuine tradeoff for its lowest price in this comparison. This matters if you specifically need 4K resolution for detailed work or a sharper visual experience, where the Anker's 1080p cap would be a real limitation, and matters less if standard 1080p resolution is sufficient for your typical use case like basic productivity or web browsing. Check a mini dock's specifically stated maximum resolution rather than assuming all dual-HDMI docks in a similar price range support the same display quality."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the j5create dock give me independent dual displays on my MacBook?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states MST is not currently supported by macOS, so on a MacBook both connected monitors would mirror identical content rather than extend your workspace independently." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a mini dual HDMI dock?", "a": "Assuming any dock with two HDMI ports delivers independent extended displays regardless of platform, when MST-based docks specifically don't support independent extension on macOS or Chrome OS, only mirroring." },
  { "q": "Is the StarTech pick worth the extra cost over the UGREEN 10-in-1 for a Mac user?", "a": "If you're on a Mac and want genuine dual-display support with detailed per-chip compatibility documentation, the StarTech's native GPU video output is the more reliable choice, while the UGREEN pick's lower price is better suited to Windows-only use." },
  { "q": "Does the Anker 7-in-1 hub include a power adapter for its 100W charging?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states the wall charger is not included, so you'll need a separately purchased or already-owned 100W-capable USB-C charger to achieve the stated charging performance." },
  { "q": "Can I use these mini docks with a gaming laptop for higher refresh rate gaming?", "a": "The j5create pick specifically supports Full HD at 144Hz and QHD at 120Hz for gaming-oriented refresh rates, while checking each other specific listing's stated refresh rate options is worth doing if high-refresh gaming is your priority." },
  { "q": "How compact are these mini docks compared to a full-size desk dock?", "a": "All four picks in this comparison are specifically marketed as compact mini docks designed to fit easily in a bag, though checking each listing's exact dimensions is worth doing if you have specific space constraints for your travel bag or desk setup." }
