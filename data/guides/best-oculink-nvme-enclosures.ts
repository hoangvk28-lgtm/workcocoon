export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C is a connector shape, not a speed, so check the actual protocol",
    "explanation": "The USB-C connector is used by multiple completely different speed tiers, including 10Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 2, 20Gbps Gen 2x2, and 40 or 80Gbps Thunderbolt/USB4, all of which physically plug into the exact same port shape on both the enclosure and your computer.\n\nThis matters because a listing photo or the word \"USB-C\" tells you nothing about which of these tiers you're actually getting, and plugging a 40Gbps enclosure into a 10Gbps port (or vice versa) simply caps your real transfer speed at whichever side is slower, wasting money if you bought the faster one for no benefit.\n\nCheck the listing's stated protocol name directly (USB 3.2 Gen 2, Gen 2x2, USB4, Thunderbolt 3/4/5) and confirm your own computer's exact port spec from its manufacturer documentation before assuming compatibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The bridge controller chip inside the enclosure affects real performance, not just the headline speed",
    "explanation": "Every external SSD enclosure contains a small bridge controller chip that translates between the M.2 NVMe SSD's native protocol and the external USB or Thunderbolt connection, and different controllers, such as the RTL9210, JMS583, or ASM2464PD, have measurably different real-world characteristics including sustained throughput, TRIM command support, and how gracefully they handle heat under long transfers.\n\nTwo enclosures can carry the identical headline speed rating while performing noticeably differently in practice because one uses a more capable or more recent controller chip than the other, and this is exactly the kind of difference that a spec sheet's top-line number won't reveal.\n\nWhere a listing names its specific bridge chip, treat that as a genuine signal of build quality worth researching, and be more cautious about unnamed or generic \"USB 3.2 controller\" language."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm NVMe-only versus NVMe-plus-SATA support against your specific SSD",
    "explanation": "M.2 SSDs come in two fundamentally different protocols, NVMe (which uses the PCIe interface for high speed) and SATA (an older, slower interface that happens to share the same M.2 physical connector), and an enclosure built for one protocol generally cannot read a drive using the other, regardless of how similar the slot looks.\n\nThis is a genuine compatibility trap because both drive types are called \"M.2 SSDs\" and look physically identical at a glance, so a buyer who already owns a SATA M.2 drive can easily purchase an NVMe-only enclosure and find the drive simply isn't recognized at all.\n\nCheck your specific SSD's protocol (printed on the drive itself or in its own listing) against the enclosure's stated support before buying, and if you're unsure which protocol you own, look specifically for NVMe-plus-SATA dual-protocol enclosures to avoid the issue entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Separate peak benchmark speed from real sustained transfer performance",
    "explanation": "A short benchmark test, the kind used in most marketing screenshots, can hit an enclosure's peak rated speed for a few seconds even on a design with genuinely poor sustained performance, because SSDs and enclosures both have cache and thermal buffers that mask throttling until a transfer runs long enough to exhaust them.\n\nThis matters most if your actual use case involves copying large video files, disk images, or backups that run for minutes rather than seconds, since that's exactly when a fanless, poorly-cooled enclosure will throttle and its real speed will drop well below the number advertised on the box.\n\nFavor listings that publish tested read and write numbers using a named SSD and host device over theoretical link-rate claims alone, and treat passive cooling as a real limitation for sustained large-file work specifically."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check your exact M.2 length and keying, since not every size fits every enclosure",
    "explanation": "M.2 SSDs come in several different physical lengths, commonly 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280 (the numbers refer to width and length in millimeters), and also use different pin \"keying\" notches, most commonly M-Key for NVMe drives or B+M Key for drives that also support SATA, and an enclosure's internal slot is generally built to accept only a specific subset of these combinations rather than all of them universally.\n\nA drive that's physically too long for a slot simply won't fit at all, while a keying mismatch can prevent the drive from making electrical contact even if it appears to slide in, so this isn't a minor compatibility footnote, it's a hard physical constraint.\n\nCheck your SSD's exact length and keying (usually printed on the drive or listed in its own product spec) against the enclosure's explicitly stated supported sizes, rather than trusting a generic \"M.2 compatible\" claim."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a faster enclosure automatically mean faster real-world transfers?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. Real throughput depends on the SSD's own generation and speed, the bridge controller inside the enclosure, cable quality, and whether the host port actually supports the claimed protocol. A 40Gbps enclosure with a slow SSD won't outperform a 10Gbps enclosure with a fast one by much."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use any M.2 NVMe SSD in any enclosure in this list?",
    "a": "No. Check the exact M.2 length (2230/2242/2260/2280) and keying (M-Key vs B+M Key) the enclosure supports against your specific SSD before buying, and confirm whether the enclosure supports NVMe only or also SATA M.2 drives."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my enclosure run slower than its advertised speed?",
    "a": "The most common causes are a host port that doesn't actually support the claimed protocol (many Macs cap USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 at 10Gbps, for example), an underrated USB-C cable, or sustained thermal throttling on a fanless design during a long transfer."
