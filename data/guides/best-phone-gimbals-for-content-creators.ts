  {
    q: "Do I need a gimbal or just a better tripod?",
    a: "A tripod is the right tool for static shots where the camera does not move. A gimbal is the right tool when you want smooth camera movement, handheld walking footage, or automatic subject tracking. For a fixed desk talking-head shot, a tripod is sufficient and costs less. For panning across products, following movement, or walking-and-talking content, a gimbal removes manual effort from those shots.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is native tracking and why does it matter?",
    a: "Native tracking means the gimbal has a sensor or AI chip that detects and follows subjects independently, regardless of which app the phone is running. App-only tracking means subject following only works inside the manufacturer's app. For creators who shoot to their native camera app for best quality, or directly to TikTok or Instagram, native tracking justifies stepping up from the $60 budget tier.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a phone gimbal for desk content creation?",
    a: "Yes. A gimbal on a desk works well for slow product pans, following movement when you lean in or reach forward, and adding cinematic motion to otherwise static shots. The built-in tripod mode on folding gimbals like the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P and Insta360 Flow 2 Pro makes them practical for desk use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P worth it over the older models?",
    a: "The 7P adds native tracking that works in any app, an improved built-in fill light with adjustable color temperature, and 7th-generation stabilization that handles faster movement with less overcorrection. For creators who want to record to their native camera app or third-party platforms with tracking active, the upgrade from older models is meaningful.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a phone gimbal work with any smartphone?",
    a: "Most gimbals on this list use a spring-loaded or magnetic clamp accommodating phones from about 60mm to 90mm wide. The Hohem iSteady M7 handles up to 500 grams payload, covering most flagship phones with heavy cases. Check the maximum payload spec before buying if you use a plus-size or foldable phone.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Apple DockKit and do I need it?",
    a: "Apple DockKit is a native iOS API that lets a compatible gimbal control tracking directly through the iPhone camera app without any third-party app open. It means you can shoot in ProRes and still have the gimbal track you automatically. It only works on iPhone. Android users on the Insta360 Flow 2 Pro get app-based tracking only.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get the gimbal bundle with the microphone or buy separately?",
    a: "If you do not already own a wireless microphone, the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P and Mic Mini TX bundle at $200 is a practical single purchase. If you already have a microphone solution, buying the standalone gimbal at $130 is better value. Microphone quality matters as much as video quality for most content types, particularly talking-head and tutorial formats.",
