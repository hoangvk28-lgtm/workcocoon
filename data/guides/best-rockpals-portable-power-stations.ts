    description: "1500W pure sine wave AC output effortlessly powers refrigerators, power tools, and medical equipment from a 960Wh capacity documented to run a small refrigerator for a full day. Ten output ports include four 1500W AC outlets, dual USB-C (33W and 100W), a DC 5525 port, a cigar port, and dual USB-A, plus a 5W LED light for camping nights.\n\n600W solar input reaches 80% charge in 1.4 hours, and the included AC charger achieves 1000W charging for a full charge in just 70 minutes. App control sets the unit to operate at a genuinely quiet 25dB, ideal for indoor office or bedroom use, and under-20ms UPS keeps computers, WiFi, and fish tanks running through blackouts. At just 23.9 lbs in a 15x8.5x8.4 inch frame, it's genuinely portable for RV or trunk storage.",

  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?",
    "a": "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a surge or peak wattage rating mean the station can run appliances at that power level?",
    "a": "No. Surge or peak ratings describe a brief burst the inverter can handle, typically for a compressor or motor startup, not a sustained output level. Always check the continuous or rated wattage figure for what the station can actually run for extended periods."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety."
