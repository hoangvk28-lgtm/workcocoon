export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Low-Profile Switches Reduce Both Typing Height and Noise Compared to Standard Mechanical Switches",
    "explanation": "The Logitech MX Mechanical's low-profile switches have a shorter total travel distance than the standard-height switches on the other three picks in this comparison, which reduces both the physical height of the keyboard and the resulting noise level, since less total keystroke distance generally means less bottom-out impact sound. This matters directly if you're using the keyboard in an open office or during video calls where typing noise could be distracting to others, less so in a private space where noise isn't a concern. Check the listing specifically for 'low-profile' switch language if reducing both keyboard height and typing noise matters for your specific work environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An 8kHz Report Rate Requires Compatible Software to Actually Unlock, Not Just the Hardware Alone",
    "explanation": "The Logitech G316 X's 8kHz report rate capability specifically requires Logitech's G HUB software to enable, meaning simply plugging in the keyboard without installing the companion software leaves you at a lower default report rate rather than automatically getting the full advertised performance. This matters if you're specifically buying for the stated 8kHz performance figure, where skipping the software setup step means you won't actually experience that benefit. Check whether a keyboard's top-tier performance specification requires a specific companion software installation, and factor that setup step into your expectations before purchase."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual-Layer Foam Acoustic Design Represents a More Sophisticated Approach Than Single-Layer Foam Dampening",
    "explanation": "The Keychron K10 Max's combination of IXPE acoustic foam for comfort and separate EPDM foam specifically for switch support represents a more engineered, multi-material approach to sound dampening than the single foam layer used in many gasket-mounted keyboards at lower price tiers, since each foam type is chosen for a distinct acoustic or structural purpose rather than one material serving both roles. This matters if typing sound quality and consistency across the entire board is a priority, where a more sophisticated foam approach tends to produce more even acoustic results across different key positions. Look for a listing that names multiple distinct foam types serving different purposes, rather than a single generic 'sound-absorbing foam' mention, if acoustic sophistication is a priority."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An On-Board LED Display and Dial Provide Control Without Alt-Tabbing Out of a Game or Application",
    "explanation": "The Logitech G316 X's physical LED dot-matrix display and dial let you adjust report rate, volume, and brightness directly on the keyboard itself without needing to alt-tab to a software window, a genuine convenience during an active game or focused work session where interrupting your current task to adjust settings is disruptive. This matters more for gaming or any workflow requiring uninterrupted focus, less so for general office use where occasionally opening a settings app isn't a meaningful inconvenience. Consider how disruptive it would be to your specific workflow to alt-tab for settings adjustments before treating an on-board display as a must-have feature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cross-Computer Control Software Like Flow Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than Standard Multi-Device Bluetooth Pairing",
    "explanation": "The Logitech MX Mechanical's Flow feature lets one keyboard and mouse combination seamlessly control multiple computers as if they were one continuous workspace, including moving your cursor and even copying text between machines, a meaningfully more integrated experience than simply pairing a keyboard to 3 separate Bluetooth devices and manually switching between them like the Keychron picks in this tier support. This matters specifically for a hybrid work setup involving both a personal and work computer used side by side regularly, less so if you only ever use the keyboard with one device at a time. Assess whether your actual workflow involves genuinely simultaneous multi-computer use before treating Flow-style integration as a meaningful differentiator over standard Bluetooth device switching."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need to install Logitech's G HUB software to use the G316 X's basic features?", "a": "No, basic typing and standard functionality work without it, but the full 8kHz report rate, custom RGB lighting, and macro programming specifically require G HUB to be installed and configured." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between the Keychron K10 Max and V5 Max?", "a": "Assuming the pricier K10 Max is automatically the better choice, when the V5 Max's 96% layout and gasket design deliver very similar day-to-day typing comfort and full QMK support for about $15 less, making the K10 Max worth it mainly if the dual-layer acoustic foam specifically matters to you." },
  { "q": "Is the Logitech MX Mechanical worth it over the cheaper Keychron K10 Max?", "a": "If you specifically want quiet low-profile switches with smart illumination and cross-computer Flow support, yes, but if you want full QMK programmability with a full-size layout, the Keychron K10 Max covers that for about $40 less." },
  { "q": "How does the Logitech MX Mechanical's Flow feature actually work between two computers?", "a": "Once set up through Logi Options+ on both computers, moving your cursor to the edge of one screen automatically transitions keyboard and mouse control to the second computer, and copied text can also transfer between the two machines seamlessly." },
  { "q": "Can I hot-swap the switches on the Logitech MX Mechanical like the other three picks in this tier?", "a": "No, the MX Mechanical does not support hot-swappable switches, so if switch customization is a priority alongside quiet low-profile typing, that's a tradeoff to consider against the other picks in this comparison." },
  { "q": "Do the Keychron picks in this tier require any software installation for basic QMK remapping?", "a": "No installation is required since QMK remapping is done through the web-based Keychron Launcher app, which works directly in a browser rather than requiring a downloaded and installed program." }
