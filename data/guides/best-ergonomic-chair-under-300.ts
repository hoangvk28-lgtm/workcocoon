  {
    q: "Is a $200 ergonomic chair worth it vs a $50 chair?",
    a: "Yes for anyone sitting 4+ hours daily. A $50 chair typically has no lumbar adjustment, fixed armrests, and foam that compresses within 6 months. A $150-$200 chair with adjustable lumbar and flip-up arms is meaningfully better. A $200-$300 chair with 3D armrests and a 2D lumbar system approaches genuine ergonomic support.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the most important feature in an ergonomic chair under $300?",
    a: "Adjustable lumbar depth (not just height). Height adjustment positions the pad at the right vertebral level. Depth adjustment matches the pad's protrusion to your natural lumbar curve - too little and it does not contact your back, too much and it pushes you forward uncomfortably.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can ergonomic chairs under $300 help with back pain?",
    a: "They can reduce back pain caused by poor seated posture and inadequate lumbar support. They cannot address pain caused by structural conditions, disc issues, or injuries. For existing back pain, a physical therapist's recommendation is more appropriate than a chair selection guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do ergonomic chairs under $300 last?",
    a: "With 6-8 hours of daily use, budget ergonomic chairs typically last 2-4 years before foam compression, mesh stretching, or mechanical wear becomes noticeable. HON Ignition 2.0 (BIFMA certified) is designed for 5-7 years. CASASIO's 5-year and TRALT's lifetime warranty provide the most coverage.",
  },
  {
    q: "What chair height do I need?",
    a: "Feet flat on the floor, thighs parallel to the ground, knees at 90 degrees. Most chairs adjust from 17-21 inches seat height, fitting users roughly 5'2\" to 6'2\". For users under 5'2\", a footrest ($15-$25) fills the gap.",
