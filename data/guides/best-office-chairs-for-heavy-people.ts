  "Buying a chair for a heavier body means paying closer attention to stated weight capacity than most listings encourage. A marketed capacity number is typically a static or best-case rating, and the actual dynamic load on a chair frame, cylinder, and casters rises when you sit down, shift, lean, or stand up repeatedly through the day. The safest approach is to buy at least 50 pounds above your actual body weight, not right up to the marketed limit.",

    "explanation": "Listings for a office chair often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the office chair holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this office chair over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any office chair you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

  {
    q: "Why should I buy a chair rated well above my actual body weight?",
    a: "Sitting down, shifting position, and standing up repeatedly creates dynamic impact that can add 30 to 50 percent more stress on a chair frame than your static body weight alone. Buying at least 50 pounds above your actual weight builds in a real safety margin instead of running a chair right at its marketed limit every day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which chairs in this list have the highest stated capacity?",
    a: "The 500lbs Extra Wide Executive and the Indulgear both state a 500 pound capacity, the highest in this list. Applying the 50 pound buffer rule, that puts a comfortable safety margin around 450 pounds of actual body weight for either pick.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a thickened steel frame actually tell me?",
    a: "A listing that explicitly states a thickened or reinforced steel frame, like the LEMBERI, is a genuine durability signal, since heavier gauge steel tends to correlate with a heavier empty chair weight, often in the 40 to 55 pound range. It's not the same as an exact gauge specification, but it's more informative than generic heavy-duty marketing language alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is cylinder class and why does it matter for heavier users?",
    a: "Gas cylinders are rated in classes, and Class 4 cylinders are built specifically for heavier users around 250 pounds and above, while a standard Class 3 cylinder is more likely to fail sooner under sustained heavier loads. None of the chairs in this guide state their cylinder class explicitly, so ask the seller directly if this is a priority for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is thick padding the same as durable foam?",
    a: "No. Thick padding is a comfort claim about how much cushioning you feel initially, while foam density, ideally 2.5 pounds per cubic foot or higher, is what actually determines how well a seat holds its support over years of daily heavier use. None of the listings in this guide state an exact foam density figure.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if a chair doesn't list a specific weight capacity?",
    a: "Two chairs in this list, the GABRYLLY and the second TRALT model, are marketed toward bigger users or general home office use without stating an exact numeric capacity. Don't assume big and tall marketing alone guarantees a specific safe weight, contact the seller to confirm an actual rating before ordering.",
