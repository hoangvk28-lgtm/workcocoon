export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best tv stand often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best tv stand holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best tv stand over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best tv stand you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best tv stand that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How low should a TV stand be for a bedroom?", a: "Aim for under 20 inches tall if you typically watch lying down or reclined against pillows, since the viewing angle from a mattress is lower than from a sofa. The WLIVE 58-inch pick in this guide sits at 18 inches and the Furinno Econ at 15 inches. A taller 30-plus inch dresser-combo stand can work if your bed sits higher or you usually watch propped upright." },
  { q: "Can a TV stand also serve as a dresser in a small bedroom?", a: "Yes. Combo pieces like the EnHomee in this guide are built as a full dresser with fabric drawers and a wood top rated for a TV up to 65 inches. This is a genuine space saver in a small bedroom that cannot fit both a separate dresser and a media console, though the depth is usually shallower than a dedicated TV stand." },
  { q: "Do I need a wall mount if I buy a TV stand for my bedroom?", a: "No, all the picks in this guide are freestanding consoles designed to hold the TV directly on the top surface, not wall mounts. If you prefer to wall mount the TV and use a lower console only for media storage, check the stand's listed depth and height to make sure it does not block the mount's swivel range." },
  { q: "Is a dresser-combo TV stand as sturdy as a regular TV stand?", a: "It depends on the specific model's frame and leg design rather than the drawer count. The EnHomee pick uses a metal frame with anti-tipping hardware and 4 plus 2 table legs rated for the combined weight of clothing storage and a mounted TV. Check the stated top weight capacity separately from the drawer capacity before loading a large TV onto a combo piece." },
  { q: "What size TV stand fits a typical bedroom wall?", a: "Bedroom walls with a TV are often narrower than a living room's main wall, especially once you account for a dresser, closet door, or nightstand sharing the same space. The compact 31.7-inch WLIVE pick in this guide fits a narrow wall or corner for a 32 to 40 inch TV, while the 58-inch picks need a fuller wall run for TVs up to 65 inches." },
  { q: "Does a built-in power outlet on a TV stand replace my wall outlet?", a: "No, a built-in outlet like the one on the Yaheetech pick still needs to be plugged into your bedroom's own wall outlet through its power cord. What it does replace is a separate power strip or extension cord running across the floor, since the outlet on the stand becomes the shared point for the TV, streaming box, and any nearby lamp or charger." },
