export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Single-Port Extender's Wattage Output Varies Meaningfully Despite the Simple 1-in-1-out Design",
    "explanation": "The picks in this comparison range from 15.4W to 30W of power output, a real difference even though every single-port extender looks similarly simple, since a higher-wattage device like a PTZ camera with a heater could fail to receive adequate power from a lower-wattage extender. This matters significantly if your connected device has a specific minimum wattage requirement, and matters less for a basic low-power device like a standard IP phone. Check your specific device's power requirement against an extender's stated maximum wattage output before assuming any 1-port extender covers your needs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Switchable DIP-Switch Mode Lets You Trade Speed for Distance on the Same Physical Unit",
    "explanation": "The Cudy pick specifically includes a DIP switch letting you choose between 100m at Gigabit speed or 250m at a reduced 10Mbps, giving genuine flexibility to prioritize either bandwidth or reach depending on your specific installation without buying a different product. This matters if your distance need varies between installations or you're not certain in advance which tradeoff you'll need, and matters less if you have a fixed, known distance requirement. Check whether an extender offers a switchable mode if you want that flexibility, rather than committing to a single fixed speed-versus-distance tradeoff."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cascade Distance Figures Require Purchasing and Chaining Multiple Units, Not Just One Extender",
    "explanation": "The Revotech pick's specifically stated 700m maximum distance requires cascading 6 separate units together, not a single extender's individual range, a distinction that matters when budgeting for a genuinely long-distance installation. This matters if you're comparing extenders based on their headline maximum distance figure, since the per-unit cost multiplies when multiple units are needed to reach that distance. Check whether a stated maximum distance is achievable from a single unit or requires purchasing and cascading several units before budgeting for your specific installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shielded RJ45 Connectors Reduce Electromagnetic Interference in Electrically Noisy Installations",
    "explanation": "The Intellinet pick specifically states shielded RJ45 connectors that help reduce electromagnetic interference, a real benefit in installations near heavy machinery, industrial equipment, or other sources of electrical noise that could otherwise degrade signal quality on unshielded connections. This matters if you're installing in a genuinely electrically noisy environment like a factory floor or near industrial equipment, and matters less in a typical home or office setting with minimal interference sources. Check whether an extender specifically states shielded connector construction if your installation environment has real electromagnetic interference concerns."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Metal Housing Provides Different Durability and Interference Characteristics Than a Plastic Enclosure",
    "explanation": "The Intellinet pick's metal housing, compared to the plastic casings on the Cudy and other picks in this comparison, offers both greater physical durability and can help with electromagnetic shielding, but typically comes at a higher price point reflecting the more expensive manufacturing material. This matters if physical durability and interference resistance are priorities for your specific installation, and matters less for a straightforward indoor installation where a plastic casing performs adequately at a lower cost. Weigh a metal housing's durability and shielding benefits against its typically higher price if your installation doesn't specifically require those characteristics."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need Gigabit speed for a single security camera connected through a 1-port extender?", "a": "Modern 4K or high-resolution cameras benefit from Gigabit speed, while a basic or older lower-resolution camera works fine with the Revotech pick's 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet speed at a lower price." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 1-port PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming any single-port extender delivers the same wattage, when power output specifically ranges from 15.4W to 30W across the picks in this comparison, which matters if your device has a higher power requirement." },
  { "q": "Is the Intellinet extender worth the much higher price over the budget picks?", "a": "If you're installing in an electrically noisy industrial environment and specifically need a metal housing with shielded connectors, the Intellinet's higher price is justified, but for a typical home or office installation, the lower-priced picks perform adequately." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Cudy extender's Long-Range mode and still get decent speed?", "a": "The Cudy's Long-Range mode specifically drops speed to 10Mbps in exchange for reaching 250m per unit or 750m when cascading three units, a real tradeoff worth considering only if your connected device doesn't need higher bandwidth." },
  { "q": "How many units can I cascade together to reach a very long distance?", "a": "It varies by product; the Revotech pick supports up to 6 units for 700m total, while the Intellinet pick supports 4 additional units for 1640ft, so checking each product's specific maximum cascade count is worth doing before planning a long-distance installation." },
  { "q": "Will these 1-port extenders work with a 24V passive PoE camera?", "a": "The Gigabit PoE Extender Outdoor Waterproof pick specifically states it does not support 24V passive PoE, only standard 48V-57V, so verifying your camera's exact PoE voltage standard against each extender's stated compatibility is important before buying." }
