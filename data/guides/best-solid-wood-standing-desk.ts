      "The FlexiSpot E6 with butcher block rubberwood top is the strongest recommendation on this list: a 3-stage dual-motor frame with a genuine solid wood desktop in the most practical size (71x30\"). The 3-stage legs give a full 23.6\"-49.2\" height range, covering users from 5'0\" to 6'4\" with good stability at maximum extension. Rubberwood (parawood) is a solid hardwood at ~980 lbf Janka. The butcher block construction means the full desktop is solid hardwood - not a veneer over MDF. At 71\" wide, dual monitors, monitor arms, a laptop stand, and full keyboard setup all fit without competing for surface space.",

    q: "Is bamboo a solid wood desktop?",
    a: "Botanically, no - bamboo is a grass, not a tree. For desk use, bamboo behaves similarly to hardwood: it is harder than most wood species (1,300-1,800 lbf Janka), more moisture-resistant, and can be manufactured into a solid desktop surface without veneer. If you are buying a desk marketed as solid wood with a bamboo top, understand that it is not wood in the traditional sense, but the surface performance is comparable or better.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a dual motor for a solid wood standing desk?",
    a: "Yes, for most solid wood tops. Solid wood desktops weigh 22-55 lbs depending on species and size - significantly more than the 12-18 lb laminate tops that single-motor frames are designed for. A dual motor distributes the load between both legs, runs cooler, levels automatically, and lasts longer under heavy top weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between 2-stage and 3-stage standing desk frames?",
    a: "2-stage frames have two telescoping segments and reach approximately 27\"-46\". 3-stage frames have three segments and reach approximately 23\"-50\". For users under 5'8\", 2-stage usually reaches their standing height comfortably. For users 6'0\"+, 3-stage is necessary to reach standing height without pushing the frame to its mechanical limit (which causes wobble).",
  },
  {
    q: "Which solid wood is best for a standing desk top?",
    a: "Acacia (1,750 lbf) for maximum hardness and visual drama. Hard maple (1,450 lbf) for a clean professional appearance. Rubberwood/parawood (980 lbf) for the best balance of durability and price. Walnut (1,010 lbf) for premium aesthetics. Bamboo (1,300-1,800 lbf) for sustainability and hardness at a mid-range price.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long should I stand at my standing desk each day?",
    a: "Research consistently suggests alternating 30 minutes standing per hour of sitting, rather than standing all day. Continuous standing creates its own strain. A standing desk is most valuable when you switch positions regularly, not when you convert to full-time standing.",
