export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Budget Splitter's Real Value Depends on Price Per Device Served, Not Just the Sticker Price Alone",
    "explanation": "The 2Pack Gigabit PoE Splitter USB C works out to roughly $9.50 per unit when you need two devices, a lower true cost per device than the DSLRKIT pick's $10.50 single-unit price if you actually need to convert two devices rather than one. This matters significantly if you need to convert multiple devices, since comparing splitters by device count divided by price reveals which option actually delivers better value for your specific need. Calculate the effective price per device converted, not just the sticker price, before assuming the cheapest single-listed price is automatically the best value for a multi-device need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Adjustable Voltage via DIP Switch Provides Real Flexibility to Serve Different Devices With One Splitter Model",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet and ANVISION picks both specifically offer adjustable output between 5V, 9V, and 12V, letting the identical physical splitter serve devices with different voltage requirements rather than needing a separate fixed-voltage splitter for each device type. This matters if you're not certain of your exact device's voltage requirement, or if you have multiple devices with different voltage needs and want one splitter model to serve all of them, and matters less if you've already confirmed one specific device's fixed voltage requirement. Consider an adjustable-voltage splitter if you want flexibility across multiple device types, rather than committing to a single fixed-voltage model."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Splitter's Explicit Compatibility Limitations Prevent a Real Mismatch Between Your Device and the Splitter's Actual Capability",
    "explanation": "The USB-C 2-Pack pick specifically states it is not for 9V/12V devices, 24V passive PoE, or other power negotiation methods, an honest and specific limitation disclosure that helps you confirm compatibility before purchase rather than discovering a mismatch after installation. This matters significantly if your device has an unusual power requirement outside the splitter's stated compatibility, since connecting an incompatible device could result in it simply not powering on or, in worse cases, damage. Read a budget splitter's specific compatibility limitations carefully, not just its headline voltage or connector type, before assuming it works with your exact device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA Compliance and Extended Manufacturer Warranties Signal Real Institutional Trust Even at a Budget Price Point",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet pick specifically combines NDAA compliance with 3 years of manufacturer protection at a genuinely budget-friendly price, showing that institutional-grade trust signals don't have to come only with premium industrial pricing. This matters if you're purchasing for an organization with procurement requirements or simply want a longer warranty for peace of mind, and matters less if you're comfortable with a shorter warranty period for a lower price. Check for named compliance certifications and specific warranty lengths even among budget-tier splitters, since these features aren't always exclusive to expensive industrial products."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Size Connector Tips Let One Splitter Physically Fit a Broader Range of Devices Than a Single Fixed Connector",
    "explanation": "The ANVISION pick specifically includes multi-size tips for its adjustable voltage output, letting the same splitter physically connect to devices with different DC barrel connector sizes, a genuinely more versatile design than a splitter with a single fixed connector size. This matters if you're converting devices with different connector sizes, or aren't certain of your exact device's connector dimensions, and matters less if you've already confirmed a single specific connector size matches your one device. Check whether a budget splitter includes multiple connector size options if physical connector compatibility across different devices is a real consideration for your purchase."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the cheapest single-unit PoE splitter always the best value?", "a": "Not necessarily; if you need to convert two devices, a 2-pack like the USB-C splitter's roughly $9.50 per unit can deliver better true value than a slightly cheaper single-unit splitter, so calculating price per device is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a budget PoE splitter?", "a": "Assuming a fixed-voltage splitter works with any non-PoE device regardless of voltage, when devices require specific voltages and a mismatched splitter simply won't power an incompatible device correctly." },
  { "q": "Is the ANVISION 2-pack worth the higher price over the TRENDnet single unit?", "a": "If you need to convert two devices with potentially different connector sizes, the ANVISION's 2-pack and multi-size tips deliver real value, but for a single device, the TRENDnet's lower price and 3-year warranty may be the better choice." },
  { "q": "Can I use the USB-C 2-pack splitter for a 12V device?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states it's not for 9V/12V devices, delivering only fixed 5V power, so a 12V device would need the adjustable TRENDnet or ANVISION picks instead." },
  { "q": "Does a budget PoE splitter need Gigabit speed for a basic security camera?", "a": "Most basic security cameras work fine with either Gigabit or standard 100Mbps splitters like the DSLRKIT pick, so Gigabit speed is specifically worth the investment for higher-resolution 4K cameras needing more bandwidth." },
  { "q": "How do I know which voltage my non-PoE device actually needs?", "a": "Checking your device's power specification label or documentation for its exact DC voltage requirement is the reliable way to confirm compatibility before choosing between a fixed-voltage or adjustable-voltage budget splitter." }
