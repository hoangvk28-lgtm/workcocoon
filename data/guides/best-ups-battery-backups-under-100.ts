export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Detailed, Device-Specific Runtime Figures Provide More Actionable Information Than a Single Generic Runtime Number",
    "explanation": "The Eaton Tripp Lite INTERNET550U specifically breaks down expected runtime by device type, 67 minutes for a 20W router, 9.2 minutes for a 100W TV, and 2.9 minutes for a 200W PC, letting you directly estimate how long your actual equipment will run rather than extrapolating from a single reference wattage figure most competitors use. This matters because most buyers don't know their exact device wattage off the top of their head, and having pre-calculated examples across common device types makes planning genuinely easier. Look for a listing that provides runtime examples across multiple realistic device types rather than just a single generic runtime-at-100W figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB Ports That Continue Working During an Actual Power Outage Are a Genuinely Different Feature Than USB Ports for Normal Charging Only",
    "explanation": "The APC BE600M1 specifically states its built-in 1.5A USB port works during outages, meaning it draws from the battery backup to keep charging a phone even when wall power is completely gone, a capability distinct from a USB port that only functions when connected to normal AC power. This matters directly during an actual outage scenario, where being able to keep a phone charged for communication or emergency use is often more immediately valuable than keeping a router running. Check specifically whether a listing states USB charging continues during outages, since not every UPS with USB ports necessarily backs those ports with battery power."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "User-Replaceable Battery Design Determines Whether a UPS Becomes Disposable or Serviceable Once Its Battery Wears Out",
    "explanation": "The APC BE600M1 specifically supports swapping the internal battery using a separately sold replacement model (APCRBC154) when the original battery ages out after a few years of use, letting you continue using the same UPS unit rather than replacing the entire device. A UPS without this documented replaceable battery design effectively has a fixed lifespan tied to its non-replaceable battery's degradation, even if the rest of the electronics remain fully functional. Check for a specific stated replacement battery model number, not just general language about battery replaceability, before assuming any UPS supports easy long-term battery swaps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "More Total Outlets Doesn't Automatically Mean More Battery-Backed Outlets for Your Critical Devices",
    "explanation": "The Eaton Tripp Lite INTERNET550U's 10 total outlets split evenly into 5 battery-backup and 5 surge-only outlets, the same 5 battery-backup count as the CyberPower SL700U despite having fewer total outlets overall, meaning the extra outlets on the INTERNET550U are additional surge-only connections rather than additional outage protection. This distinction matters if your priority is maximizing how many devices actually stay powered during an outage rather than simply having more total outlets available for surge protection alone. Compare the specific battery-backup outlet count, not just the total outlet count, when your priority is outage protection for multiple devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Slim Profile Design on a Higher-VA UPS Represents a Genuine Space-Efficiency Achievement",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower SL700U packs its 700VA capacity, the highest in this comparison, into a slim profile design specifically suited to tighter spaces like a home office desk or entertainment center shelf, a harder engineering balance to achieve than a bulkier tower-style UPS with the same capacity. This matters if your available installation space is genuinely limited, since a higher-capacity UPS in a bulky form factor may simply not fit where you need it. Check whether a listing specifically addresses both capacity and physical footprint together if space constraints are a real factor in your decision."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the APC BE600M1's USB port really keep charging my phone during a power outage?", "a": "Yes, its listing specifically states the built-in 1.5A USB port works during outages, drawing from the battery backup to continue charging connected devices even when wall power is completely gone." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing outlet counts across these UPS units?", "a": "Assuming more total outlets always means more outage protection, when a pick like the Eaton Tripp Lite INTERNET550U splits its extra outlets between battery-backup and surge-only types, so the actual number of outlets that stay powered during an outage may be the same as a competitor with fewer total outlets." },
  { "q": "Is the CyberPower SL700U worth the price premium over the ST625U?", "a": "If you specifically need the highest available capacity at this tier along with slightly faster USB charging, yes, but if you want a matching $100,000 warranty and nearly identical USB charging at a lower price, the ST625U offers strong value instead." },
  { "q": "How do I know how long my specific devices will run on one of these UPS units?", "a": "Check your device's wattage rating (often on the power adapter or in its specifications) and compare it against runtime figures like those the Eaton Tripp Lite INTERNET550U provides for common device types, adjusting proportionally for devices with different wattage draws." },
  { "q": "Can I replace the battery in the APC BE600M1 myself when it eventually degrades?", "a": "Yes, its listing specifically references the APCRBC154 replacement battery, sold separately, designed for easy user replacement without needing to purchase an entirely new UPS unit." },
  { "q": "Do these UPS units require any special installation or wiring?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison simply plug into a standard wall outlet like any other power strip, with no special electrical wiring or professional installation required for basic setup." }
