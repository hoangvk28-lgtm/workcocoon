export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your exact screen size and device type before ordering",
    "explanation": "A privacy screen's diagonal size number alone isn't enough to guarantee fit, since two devices can share the same advertised diagonal measurement while having different actual active display dimensions or aspect ratios, and a filter sized for a desktop monitor is not automatically interchangeable with a laptop of the same nominal diagonal size.\n\nThis genuinely trips buyers up more than any other spec on this product, because a filter that's even slightly too large or too small won't seat correctly, leaving gaps at the edges or overhanging the bezel, which defeats the privacy function entirely.\n\nCheck the listing's stated active area width and height in inches, not just the diagonal size, and compare it against your specific monitor or laptop model's actual screen dimensions from the manufacturer's spec sheet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the viewing angle rating actually means",
    "explanation": "A privacy filter's viewing angle spec, commonly given as a range like plus or minus 30 or plus or minus 60 degrees, describes how far off-center someone can stand before the screen appears dark or blacked out to them, with a narrower angle blocking side views more aggressively but also slightly dimming and softening the image for you sitting straight in front of it.\n\nThis is a real, felt tradeoff, not a minor spec: a tighter privacy angle is genuinely more effective at stopping a shoulder-surfer in an open office or on a plane, but it also means you'll notice more brightness loss and color shift when looking at your own screen, especially at extreme angles.\n\nCheck the listing's stated degree range and read whether it's measured from directly in front or from the edge of the screen, since sellers describe this inconsistently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Decide between adhesive tabs and a slide-on or frame mount",
    "explanation": "Privacy filters attach either with small adhesive tabs or hooks stuck to the bezel, which is removable but can leave light residue and requires care when repositioning, or with a slide-on frame or magnetic mount that clips over the top and sides of the screen without any adhesive at all, trading slightly less secure edge contact for zero residue and easy removal.\n\nIf you share a device, switch between filtered and unfiltered use often, or simply don't want tape near your screen, a slide-on or magnetic mount is worth seeking out specifically, even though adhesive-tab filters are more common and often cheaper.\n\nCheck the listing's stated mounting method directly, since \"privacy filter\" alone doesn't tell you which attachment style you're getting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh bundled anti-glare or blue-light filtering against a basic privacy-only filter",
    "explanation": "Some filters bundle additional coatings on top of the core privacy function, most commonly anti-glare (which diffuses reflections from overhead lighting and windows) or blue-light filtering (which reduces the blue wavelength light associated with eye strain and disrupted sleep), and these add real functional value but also typically raise the price over a basic privacy-only filter.\n\nWhether that premium is worth paying depends on your actual environment: anti-glare matters far more if you sit near a window or under bright overhead lights, while blue-light filtering matters more if you're already using screen time software and want the tint built into the hardware itself.\n\nCheck the listing's stated coatings explicitly rather than assuming any filter includes both by default, since a plain privacy filter blocks side viewing but does nothing for glare or blue light."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, especially at less common screen sizes",
    "explanation": "Less common screen sizes, like 17 inch desktop monitors or unusual ultrawide dimensions, typically have a much smaller pool of dedicated filter listings and far fewer total reviews than the dominant 24 and 27 inch desktop sizes, which means a high star rating at an uncommon size often rests on a much thinner sample than the same rating would at a common size.\n\nThis matters because a filter with a 4.3 rating on 120 reviews carries meaningfully less statistical confidence than one with a similar rating on several thousand reviews, even though the headline number looks comparable at a glance.\n\nWhen comparing filters at an uncommon size, check both the rating and the review count together, and don't assume a smaller selection at your size means lower quality, it usually just reflects lower production volume for that specific dimension."
