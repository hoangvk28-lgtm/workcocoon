  "The chipset story stays the same as the cheaper tier, Realtek's RTL8156BG still powers most of this lineup, so the real comparison points at this budget are charging wattage, confirmed device compatibility lists, and how much warranty backing you're getting for the extra dollars."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Match power delivery wattage to your laptop's actual charger",
    explanation: "A USB-C Power Delivery passthrough port lets one cable both charge your laptop and carry the ethernet connection, but the wattage rating determines whether it can actually fast-charge your specific laptop. A 100W-rated adapter covers most 13-14 inch laptops and standard MacBooks, but a 16 inch MacBook Pro or a power-hungry gaming laptop ships with a charger rated well above that, meaning a 100W passthrough charges it more slowly than its included charger would. Check the wattage printed on your laptop's own charger brick, then compare it against the adapter's stated PD wattage before assuming any PD-rated adapter fully replaces your charger."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weigh a stated multi-year warranty against a lower price",
    explanation: "Some adapters in this price range come from brands that explicitly state a 2-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship, while others rely on the standard return window without extending any additional coverage. At $30-45, that warranty term becomes a real part of the value calculation, since a failure eighteen months in costs you the full price again with no coverage on a warranty-less pick. Check the listing's \"What You Get\" section or product description for an explicit warranty length rather than assuming any adapter at this price includes one."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check whether device compatibility is named specifically or claimed generically",
    explanation: "A listing that names exact device generations, specific MacBook Pro or iPad Pro models by year and chip, gives you something checkable against your own hardware, while a listing that only claims \"universal compatibility\" leaves you guessing whether it's actually been tested on your specific device. This especially matters for iPad and iPhone use, since not every USB-C ethernet adapter has been confirmed to work with Apple's mobile devices even when it works fine with a MacBook. Look for your exact device model named in the bullet points, not just a general product-category claim."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Decide if extra USB-C ports are worth paying more for",
    explanation: "A small number of adapters at this price combine the ethernet connection with two or three extra USB-C data ports, functioning as a mini hub rather than a single-purpose dongle. This is worth paying extra for specifically if your laptop has only one USB-C port total and you regularly need to connect a drive or another peripheral at the same time as ethernet. If your laptop already has multiple USB-C ports, a single-purpose ethernet adapter covers the same networking need for less money without the added bulk."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Confirm the OS driver situation before assuming plug-and-play",
    explanation: "Most adapters at this price use the Realtek RTL8156BG chipset, which has mature native support on Windows and macOS, but Linux and ChromeOS support varies more, with a few listings explicitly warning that older Linux kernels need the latest Realtek USB 2.5G Ethernet Controller driver installed manually rather than working immediately out of the box. If you're running Linux or ChromeOS as your primary system, prioritize a listing that documents this driver behavior directly rather than one that only claims broad, unspecified compatibility."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Is 100W or 140W power delivery the right choice for my laptop?",
    a: "Check the wattage printed on your laptop's own charger brick. If it's rated 100W or under, a 100W passthrough adapter fully covers your charging needs. If your charger is rated higher, common on 16-inch MacBook Pros and some gaming laptops, a 140W adapter is needed to match full charging speed."
  },
  {
    q: "Does a longer warranty actually matter for a $30-45 adapter?",
    a: "It can, since these are low-cost electronics that occasionally fail after normal daily plugging and unplugging. A 2-year warranty means a failure well into ownership is still covered, while a pick with no stated warranty term relies only on the standard short return window most retailers offer."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use one of these adapters with both my MacBook and my iPad?",
    a: "Some can, but check the specific listing rather than assuming. A few adapters in this comparison explicitly name iPad Pro and iPad Air compatibility alongside MacBooks, while others only confirm laptop compatibility and don't mention tablets at all."
  },
  {
    q: "Why would I pay more for a multi-port adapter instead of a plain ethernet dongle?",
    a: "It's worth it if your laptop has only one USB-C port and you regularly need both a wired network connection and another USB-C accessory at the same time. If your laptop has multiple USB-C ports already, a single-purpose ethernet adapter meets the same networking need for less money."
  },
  {
    q: "Will these adapters slow down if I'm also charging my laptop through them?",
    a: "The ethernet connection and the power delivery passthrough run on separate circuitry inside the adapter, so charging shouldn't meaningfully affect the network speed. The bigger factor in real-world speed is whether your router or switch supports 2.5GbE in the first place, not whether the adapter is also charging your laptop."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to install drivers for these adapters on a Chromebook?",
    a: "Most work without a manual driver install on ChromeOS, but at least one listing in this comparison specifically documents ChromeOS compatibility while others don't mention it at all. If you're on ChromeOS specifically, prioritize a listing that names ChromeOS support directly rather than assuming it based on general USB-C compatibility."
