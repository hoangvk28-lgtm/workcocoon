The multi-purpose design covers flat, rocker, and knee support positions in a single unit.

Three height settings cover the 4.3 to 6.7 inch range, which overlaps well with the foot placement needs of users in the 5'0\" to 5'4\" range.\n\nThe rocking motion on the HUANUO is more pronounced than memory foam rockers, which suits users who want active movement rather than just a stable platform.

Four integrated massage rollers allow active foot movement similar to dedicated massage mats without a separate purchase.

At 7.5 inches tall, it provides more lift than any standard footrest in this roundup and supports users in very high seating configurations where other footrests do not reach. It is the premium pick for a specific use case rather than a general-purpose buy.

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What height footrest do short people need?", a: "Users between 5'0\" and 5'4\" typically benefit from footrests in the 3 to 6 inch range. The correct height is whatever keeps the thighs parallel to the floor with feet flat. Adjustable-height models like the ComfiLife or CasaZenith let users find their precise height rather than estimating from a fixed-height pick." },
  { q: "Are rocking footrests better for circulation?", a: "Yes. Rocking or tilting footrests encourage passive movement in the calf muscles and ankles, which helps circulation during long seated sessions. Models like the HUANUO and StrongTek Wood provide active rocking motion compared to the stationary support of a flat foam block." },
  { q: "Can footrests help with lower back pain?", a: "Yes, but only as part of a complete ergonomic setup. A footrest that keeps feet flat and thighs parallel reduces the pelvic tilt that loads the lower back. Combined with proper chair height and lumbar support, the ergonomic benefit is significant. A footrest alone does not compensate for a chair set at the wrong height." },
  { q: "Should I get a foam or wooden footrest?", a: "Foam footrests are softer and better for bare feet. Wooden footrests like the StrongTek last longer without compression changes, suit users who prefer firm surfaces, and look warmer in natural-finish setups. For most users in standard desk chairs, foam is more comfortable. For users who prefer hard-surface balance boards, wood is the better long-term choice." },
  { q: "Are budget footrests worth it for short people?", a: "Budget options like the BlissTrends at $19.98 cover the basic needs: modest height lift and a non-slip base. They lack the massage features and multi-height adjustability of mid-range models. If the goal is simply to keep feet from dangling, budget options work. If active movement or precise height targeting matters, a $30-$40 adjustable model is worth the extra cost." }
