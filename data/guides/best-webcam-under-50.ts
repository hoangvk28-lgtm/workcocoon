export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Do I even need an external webcam, or is my laptop's built-in camera good enough?",
    a: "It depends on how often you're on camera. Most built-in laptop cameras are 720p with poor low-light performance and a wide-angle lens that exaggerates nose and forehead. If you're on Zoom daily, a $25 external webcam is a noticeable upgrade. If you're on video calls once a week, the built-in is fine. One honest benchmark: if people frequently ask you to turn your camera on, your built-in is probably fine. If people ask you to turn it off because the quality is distracting, an external webcam is worth it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will these webcams work on a Chromebook without installing software?",
    a: "Yes — all five picks in this guide are plug-and-play on Chrome OS. No driver installation required. Chrome OS natively supports USB webcams that follow the UVC (USB Video Class) standard, which all mainstream webcam brands use. The only webcams that don't work on Chromebook are those requiring proprietary drivers — usually very cheap no-name units or AI-feature webcams (like OBSBOT) that need companion apps.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 720p webcam quality acceptable for Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet?",
    a: "Technically yes, but 1080p is the practical minimum in 2026. Zoom and Teams both support 1080p HD, and meeting participants can tell the difference. More importantly, most budget webcams labeled 720p actually deliver below-720p quality in poor lighting. Every pick in this guide is genuine 1080p — you won't need to apologize for your video quality in class or at work.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the right field of view (FOV) for a small desk setup?",
    a: "For a small desk where you sit close to the screen, 78°–90° is ideal. Wider angles (110°+) show more background — which means more of your dorm room or cluttered desk in frame. The 90° FOV on all five picks here is the sweet spot: it fills the frame naturally when you're sitting 18–24 inches from your screen, without exposing too much of what's behind you.",
  },
  {
    q: "My laptop only has one USB port. Can I still use a webcam?",
    a: "Yes, but you'll need a USB hub. All five picks use USB-A connections — if your laptop only has USB-C, you'll need a USB-C to USB-A adapter (costs under $10) or a small USB-C hub. The NexiGo N60 and EMEET models draw very little power, so they work reliably through most USB hubs without power delivery issues.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will the webcam clip fit on a thin-bezel laptop?",
    a: "Logitech's clip mechanism (Brio 100 and 101) is specifically designed for thin-bezel screens — it grips securely without scratching. The NexiGo N60's clip is functional but slightly stiffer. For very thin Chromebook lids (under 4mm thick), test the grip on day one and tighten the hinge if it droops. Avoid over-tightening plastic clips on glass-backed screens.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I look better on a budget webcam without buying a ring light?",
    a: "The biggest free improvement: face a window (natural light from in front of you, not behind). This alone transforms a $20 webcam. If natural light isn't available, put a plain desk lamp at eye level in front of you — not above or to the side. Raise your laptop on a stand or stack of books to bring the webcam closer to eye level; cameras aimed upward show ceiling and nostrils. A light-colored wall behind you also bounces light back onto your face.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do physical privacy shutters actually matter?",
    a: "In shared rooms, yes. A physical shutter is a mechanical lens cover — it physically blocks the lens, not just disables the software. If you share a dorm room, a physical shutter gives you certainty that the camera isn't on between calls, regardless of what the software shows. The NexiGo N60 and EMEET C960 both include physical shutters. The Logitech Brio models do not.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the best webcam under $50 for streaming on Twitch or Discord?",
    a: "Streaming requires 60fps for smooth motion — no webcam in the under-$50 range delivers this reliably. All five picks are 30fps. If streaming quality matters to you, you need to stretch your budget to the Logitech C920x (~$55–$60) or above. For Discord video calls and study streams where motion quality isn't critical, 30fps is acceptable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use one of these webcams on a laptop with no external monitor?",
    a: "Yes. All five picks clip onto laptop screens. Position the webcam on the top edge of your laptop lid — the same location as the built-in camera. The advantage over the built-in: you can reposition the external webcam slightly to the left or right to improve your angle, and the image quality will be noticeably better. For laptop-only setups, the NexiGo N60's compact clip is the easiest to reposition.",
  },
