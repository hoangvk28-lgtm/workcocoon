  "Not every product marketed as a desk pegboard uses the standardized 1-inch hole spacing that real pegboard-style boards rely on. Some branded organizer systems use proprietary hole or peg shapes that won't accept generic hooks or accessories bought separately, a compatibility trap that's rarely disclosed on the listing page. Worth confirming a board's hole pattern is genuinely standard before assuming any hook set will fit it.",
  "Material quality determines how much weight each hook can actually hold and whether the board sags after months of use, real pegboard-grade hardboard or MDF holds up far better than thin decorative board dressed up with a pegboard pattern. It's also worth thinking about the board loaded, not empty, a pegboard mounted vertically at the back of a desk creates real tipping leverage once it's hung with monitor arms, hooks, and shelves, especially on lighter desks without a wall anchor.",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check material quality against real sag resistance over months of use",
    "explanation": "The board's material determines how much weight each hook can actually hold and whether the panel visibly sags after months of real use, genuine pegboard-grade hardboard, MDF, or metal holds up meaningfully better under sustained weight than thin decorative board that's simply printed or cut with a pegboard-style pattern for looks.\n\nThis matters directly if you plan to hang anything with real weight, monitor arms, tool organizers, or multiple loaded shelves, versus just a few lightweight decorative items.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific stated material and thickness, and check reviews for mentions of sagging or warping over time, not just the initial unboxing appearance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider loaded-condition tipping stability, not just the empty board's footprint",
    "explanation": "A pegboard mounted vertically at the back of a desk creates real tipping leverage once it's actually loaded with monitor arms, hooks, and shelves, a board that looks perfectly stable empty in a product photo can behave very differently once weighted, especially on a lighter desk without a wall anchor point.\n\nThis matters more the taller and heavier the loaded board becomes relative to the desk's own weight and base stability.\n\nCheck whether the product includes or supports a wall-anchor mounting option, and check reviews specifically for mentions of stability once the board is actually loaded with accessories, not just how it looks unmounted."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match desk depth loss to how much usable surface you can actually give up",
    "explanation": "A pegboard mounted at the back of a desk, especially a large panel, meaningfully reduces the usable flat desk surface in front of it, a tradeoff that's easy to underestimate from a product photo alone since the panel's actual footprint eats directly into working space you'd otherwise use for a keyboard, notebook, or additional monitor placement.\n\nThis matters more on a smaller or shallower desk where every inch of depth counts, less on a large desk with depth to spare.\n\nCheck the listed panel depth and desk clearance requirements against your actual desk's dimensions, not just the panel's height and width, before assuming it fits comfortably."

    "criterion": "Weigh mounting method against your desk type and whether you can drill into it",
    "explanation": "Pegboards mount to a desk in different ways, clamp-on brackets that grip the desk edge without drilling, freestanding designs that sit on the desk surface, or permanently screwed mounts, and which one applies to you depends heavily on your desk's construction and whether you're allowed or willing to drill into it.\n\nThis matters directly for a rented space, shared office furniture, or a desk you don't want to permanently modify, where a clamp-on or freestanding design is the safer choice even if it offers somewhat less rigid stability than a screwed mount.\n\nCheck the specific mounting method and confirm it's compatible with your desk's edge thickness and material before ordering."
