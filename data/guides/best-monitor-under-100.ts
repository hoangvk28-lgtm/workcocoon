    a: "Yes. IPS panels, 100 to 180Hz refresh rates, and even 1440p resolution are all available under $100 in 2026. The days of needing $150 or more for a good IPS monitor are over. The main limitations are USB-C input (starts at $120 to $150), height-adjustable stands (add a monitor arm for $25 to $30), and meaningful HDR brightness.",
  },
  {
    q: "IPS vs VA: which is better for studying?",
    a: "IPS for studying. Accurate colors reduce eye strain during long sessions with documents and PDFs, and 178-degree viewing angles mean no color shift when you lean or tilt. VA is better specifically for movies and gaming with dark scenes due to higher contrast (3000:1 vs 1000:1).",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 1440p worth it under $100?",
    a: "Yes if your GPU supports it and the KTC H24T27 is currently at or below $100. The jump from 1080p (92 PPI) to 1440p (123 PPI) at 24 inches is immediately visible in text sharpness. Verify the current price and confirm your GPU outputs 2560x1440 before purchasing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need 144Hz or 180Hz for gaming?",
    a: "Only for competitive fast-paced gaming (FPS, battle royale). For casual gaming alongside studying, 100Hz is the sweet spot. It is noticeably smoother than 75Hz for everything including desktop use, without the $99 ceiling cost of 180Hz. If gaming performance is the priority, the Sansui ES-G24F4 at 180Hz is worth it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size monitor is best for a dorm desk?",
    a: "24 inches is the standard for a typical 60 to 80cm dorm desk. It is large enough for two windows side-by-side and small enough to fit without dominating the surface. If your desk is unusually small (under 60cm wide or under 50cm deep), the Philips 221V8LB at 21.5 inches saves meaningful space.",
  },
  {
    q: "What monitor accessories do I actually need?",
    a: "A monitor arm ($25 to $30) solves the tilt-only stand limitation common to all picks in this guide and saves desk surface. An HDMI cable if your monitor does not include one (the Sansui does). A USB hub since no monitor under $100 has USB ports. A cable management tray if you want a clean desk.",
