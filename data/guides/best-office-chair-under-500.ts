export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is $500 enough for a good office chair?", a: "For most users sitting 5 to 6 hours daily, yes. At $500, you can get a chair with adjustable lumbar height and depth, 4D armrests, adjustable seat depth, good mesh breathability, and a multi-year warranty. These are the ergonomic fundamentals that prevent posture-driven back and neck strain. The differences from $500 to $1,200 chairs are engineering refinement, material quality, warranty length, and brand-backed service - significant for heavy users, but not always necessary for standard workdays." },
  { q: "What is the best office chair under $500 for back pain?", a: "For back pain specifically, the SIHOO Doro S300 at $499 provides auto-calibrating recline and 3D lumbar that directly address common back pain drivers. The Branch Ergonomic Tall or standard at $349-$499 offers the most precise manual lumbar adjustment with the best warranty. For users with diagnosed conditions, see our [office chair for back pain](/guide/best-office-chair-for-back-pain) guide which also covers the $1,000-plus options that add clinical-level ergonomic design." },
  { q: "How does an office chair under $500 compare to a Herman Miller?", a: "A $500 chair delivers the ergonomic fundamentals (lumbar adjustment, armrest adjustment, seat depth, breathable mesh) without the engineering differentiators of Herman Miller (PostureFit SL dual-point back, 8Z Pellicle mesh, 12-year warranty, decades of clinical research backing). For most users, the functional difference is notable but not critical. For users with back pain history or 8-hour daily sitting, the Herman Miller engineering pays for itself in comfort and longevity." },
  { q: "Should I buy a gaming chair or an office chair under $500?", a: "For 5-plus hours of desk work, an ergonomic office chair (Branch, NOUHAUS) provides better sustained back support and breathability than most gaming chairs. Gaming chairs at $500 optimize for aesthetics and gamer postures (slight recline, peripheral reach). Office chairs optimize for upright keyboard and monitor postures across long sessions. The exception is size-specific gaming chairs like the Secretlab TITAN Evo S for short users, where the correct proportions outweigh the category distinction." },
  { q: "Are Autonomous ErgoChair chairs worth buying?", a: "The Autonomous ErgoChair Pro offers the most adjustment axes of any chair under $500 in this guide. The 2-year warranty and brand's direct-to-consumer focus mean less long-term service support than Branch or established brands. For buyers who want maximum feature count and are comfortable with a shorter warranty, the ErgoChair Pro delivers strong value at $499. For buyers who prioritize warranty longevity, the Branch Ergonomic or HON Ignition 2.0 provide longer coverage at similar prices." },
