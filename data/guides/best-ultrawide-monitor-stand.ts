An arm or mount stand instead grips your desk and holds the monitor by its VESA pattern, letting you adjust height, tilt, and rotation, which is generally better for posture but requires your monitor to actually have a VESA mount.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your desk can actually grip the mounting base before comparing arms",
    "explanation": "A monitor arm's clamp or grommet base needs a solid desk edge to grip securely, and this is the real first question to answer before comparing gas spring tension or weight capacity, since a hollow honeycomb-core desktop, a glass top, or a desk under about an inch thick can rule out an entire category of arms regardless of how good the arm itself is.\n\nThis matters because discovering after purchase that your desk simply can't mount the arm you bought is a common and entirely avoidable problem.\n\nCheck your desk's actual edge thickness and construction (solid, hollow-core, or glass), and confirm the arm's clamp or grommet base is explicitly rated for that construction before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check real per-arm weight capacity, not the bundled-stand weight printed on the monitor box",
    "explanation": "Monitor weight ratings printed on the box often reference the monitor's included stand, not the bare panel weight relevant to a monitor arm, and a monitor arm's real weight capacity needs to match your specific monitor's actual panel weight without its stand, information usually found in the monitor's separate spec sheet rather than the box itself.\n\nThis matters directly for a larger or ultrawide monitor, where the gap between stand-inclusive and bare-panel weight can be substantial enough to matter.\n\nCheck your monitor's bare panel weight (without its stand) in its official spec sheet, and compare that specifically against the arm's rated capacity, not a generalized weight class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify VESA compatibility for both your monitor and the arm's mounting plate",
    "explanation": "VESA mounting patterns come in a few standard sizes (75x75mm and 100x100mm are most common), and a mismatch between your monitor's VESA pattern and the arm's mounting plate means the arm simply won't attach, some arms include an adapter for multiple patterns while others support only one.\n\nThis matters directly for a monitor with a non-standard or larger VESA pattern, particularly some ultrawide or curved monitors, where assuming universal compatibility can lead to an unusable purchase.\n\nCheck your monitor's specific VESA pattern in its spec sheet, and confirm the arm explicitly supports that pattern, either natively or with an included adapter, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand gas spring tension and how it affects long-term reliability",
    "explanation": "A gas spring monitor arm relies on an internal pressurized cylinder to hold the monitor at any height with minimal effort, and tension needs to be roughly matched to your monitor's actual weight, a monitor lighter than the spring's calibrated range can drift upward on its own, while pressure calibrated too low for a heavier monitor won't hold position and will slowly droop.\n\nThis matters for long-term usability, not just initial setup, since gas springs can also lose tension gradually over years of use.\n\nCheck the arm's rated weight range against your monitor's actual weight, favoring a monitor that falls comfortably within the middle of that range rather than at either extreme."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider reach and range of motion against your actual desk depth and seating position",
    "explanation": "An arm's horizontal reach and vertical range of motion determine how far the monitor can extend from the mounting point and how much height adjustment is available, and these dimensions matter differently depending on your desk depth and how far back you sit, a shallow desk needs less reach than a deep one, and a standing desk that changes height throughout the day needs a wider vertical range to stay at eye level.\n\nThis matters more for anyone switching between sitting and standing regularly, less for a fixed single seated position.\n\nCheck the arm's listed reach and height range against your actual desk depth and how much your seated or standing eye level varies throughout the day."

    q: "Do I need a VESA mount for an ultrawide monitor stand?",
    a: "Only if you're buying an arm-style stand. Risers like the WESTREE, Across-Star, and OImaster in this list need no VESA mount at all since the monitor's existing base rests on the platform. Arms like the VIVO or HUANUO picks require your monitor to have a VESA 75mm or 100mm mounting pattern.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which stand in this list works for a true 49\" super-ultrawide?",
    a: "The HUANUO TitanLift is the only arm-style stand in this list rated for up to 49\" at 44 lbs, with reinforcement specifically for the torque a curved super-ultrawide panel adds. The WESTREE riser can also handle a 49\" monitor's weight at up to 150 lbs since it's not VESA-dependent, as long as the monitor's own base fits the platform.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a riser if I want the option to add an arm mount later?",
    a: "Not directly, a riser and an arm are two different mounting approaches and aren't interchangeable on the same monitor at the same time. If you think you might want height and tilt adjustability down the line, it's worth starting with an arm-style stand instead of a riser, provided your monitor has a VESA mount.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why would I choose a freestanding stand instead of a clamp-on arm?",
    a: "A freestanding stand like the VIVO pick in this list doesn't clamp to the desk edge at all, which matters in rentals or shared offices where desk clamping isn't allowed. It still takes up desk footprint since nothing is anchored, so it's a solution for mounting restrictions, not for saving desk space.",
