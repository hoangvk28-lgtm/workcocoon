    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best cable management boxe often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best cable management boxe holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best cable management boxe over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best cable management boxe you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best cable management boxe that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What size cable management box do I need?", a: "Measure your power strip length first. Most standard 6-outlet power strips measure 11 to 14 inches long. Add 1 to 2 inches clearance for the cables entering and exiting the strip. The D-Line Large at 16.5 inches and YUANYE Large at 16.14 inches accommodate most standard power strips. Measure before ordering, as returning cable boxes after testing is inconvenient." },
  { q: "Are cable management boxes fire safe?", a: "Cable boxes made from electrically insulated ABS plastic (D-Line, Yecaye, YUANYE) meet standard electrical safety requirements for enclosing power strips. The Chouky and YUANYE specifically use fire-retardant ABS. Real wood boxes (Baskiss, Luxe Designs) are not fire-retardant but are used safely for decades in homes worldwide at normal power strip load levels." },
  { q: "Can I put a surge protector in a cable management box?", a: "Yes. A surge protector operates identically inside a cable management box as it does on an open surface, provided the box has adequate ventilation for heat dissipation. Do not use a cable box with a sealed lid and no ventilation holes for surge protectors under consistent heavy load, as heat can accumulate and reduce the surge protector's lifespan." },
  { q: "Where should I put a cable management box?", a: "Under the desk directly beneath the main monitor or computer position is the most common placement, where it conceals the power strip and adapter cluster from view. On the desk behind the monitor is another option for users who do not want to reach under the desk to plug and unplug devices. Floor placement works for standing-desk cable drops where the power strip sits on the floor." },
  { q: "How many cables can fit in a cable management box?", a: "A standard 6-outlet power strip, its power cable, and two to four device cables typically fill a Large (16-inch) cable management box. For setups with more cables, use a 3-pack (YUANYE) to distribute cables across multiple boxes rather than forcing all cables into one box, which makes the box difficult to close and reduces ventilation." },
