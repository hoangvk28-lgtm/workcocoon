For gaming: HyperX Cloud Stinger 2. For Android ANC earbuds: Samsung Galaxy Buds FE. No single best exists; the guide matches the right product to each situation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Sony WH-CH520 worth it at $60?",
    a: "Yes. Sony's Quick Charge, multipoint Bluetooth, 50h battery, and brand support are hard to match at this price. No ANC is the main limitation. If noise cancellation is essential, the Soundcore Q20i is the alternative.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is LDAC and is it worth paying for?",
    a: "LDAC is a wireless codec developed by Sony that transmits at up to 990kbps, roughly three times the bandwidth of standard Bluetooth SBC. On a compatible Android device, LDAC delivers genuine Hi-Res wireless audio. The Soundcore Space Q45 includes LDAC. It is worth it if you use Android and stream high-quality audio, but only when the Space Q45 is at or below $70.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 good for both gaming and music?",
    a: "Yes. The 50mm drivers and closed-back design handle both uses. The sound signature is slightly colored (enhanced bass and treble) rather than flat neutral, which suits gaming and casual music. For critical music production, the ATH-M30x's neutral monitoring signature is more accurate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE at regular price?",
    a: "No. At $99 MSRP there are better options. The Galaxy Buds FE is good value specifically when discounted to $50 to $70. Always verify the current price before purchasing.",
