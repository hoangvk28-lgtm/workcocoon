export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An Included Mattress Engineered Specifically for the Frame Removes a Genuine Compatibility Risk",
    "explanation": "The PUREMIND pick's included split three-fold queen mattress is specifically designed and engineered to match its exact frame dimensions, ensuring a perfect fold every time, unlike a bring-your-own-mattress murphy bed where you need to carefully verify thickness, weight, and foldability against the frame's stated specifications. This matters because a generic mattress, especially a thick memory foam type, might not fold as designed even if it technically meets a stated thickness range, since foam density and construction affect how well it bends. Consider whether you already own a mattress confirmed compatible with a specific frame's requirements, or whether an included, purpose-built mattress removes that uncertainty entirely for a bring-your-own-mattress murphy bed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hardware Kit Weight Ratings and Complete Bed Weight Ratings Aren't Measuring the Same Thing",
    "explanation": "The Wilding Wallbeds kit states its wood slat and rail system is rated to 2,000 lbs while the mechanism itself supports 1,500 lbs, figures that reflect the bare hardware and structural components alone, distinct from the CECER or PUREMIND picks' 1000 lb rating that accounts for their complete assembled cabinet including doors, drawers, and side panels. This matters because directly comparing these numbers without understanding what's actually being measured can lead to an inaccurate sense of which pick is genuinely 'stronger' for your needs. Check whether a weight rating refers to bare hardware or a fully assembled structure before treating a higher number as automatically superior."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "In-Bed Charging Port Placement Affects Real Usability More Than Simply Having Ports Included",
    "explanation": "The CECER pick specifically positions its 2 USB ports and 2 AC outlets on the right side of the bed for convenient device charging while lying down, a placement detail that matters for actual usability, since ports positioned awkwardly or requiring you to reach far from a resting position reduce the practical value of having charging built in at all. This matters if you plan to regularly use devices in bed, like watching content or charging a phone overnight, less so if charging convenience isn't a priority for how the guest room gets used. Check the listing's description of port placement and accessibility, not just whether charging ports exist, if in-bed device use matters to your specific situation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Freestanding Design's 'No Drilling' Convenience Comes With a Tradeoff Worth Understanding Before Committing",
    "explanation": "The PUREMIND pick's freestanding design specifically avoids wall-mounted drilling requirements, making it genuinely renter-friendly, but this convenience means the unit relies entirely on its own structural stability and floor contact rather than being anchored to a wall, which could matter in terms of how securely it stays in place during use compared to a wall-mounted design. This matters more in a household with active children or pets who might interact with the furniture unexpectedly, less so in a controlled adult-only space. Consider your specific household's activity level and whether wall-anchored stability genuinely matters for your situation before assuming a freestanding design is strictly equivalent to a wall-mounted one in terms of stability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Package Shipping at This Scale Is the Norm, Not the Exception, and Should Factor Into Assembly Planning",
    "explanation": "The Hlivelood pick specifically ships in 4 separate packages that may not arrive simultaneously, and this pattern is common across large murphy bed furniture at this tier due to the sheer size and weight of components like the cabinet panels, mattress platform, and hardware. This matters because starting assembly with only some packages present wastes coordinated effort, particularly if you've arranged help for a specific day. Check the listing's shipping section for the specific number of packages and any noted staggered arrival possibility before committing to a firm installation date with helpers."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the included mattress on the CECER or PUREMIND picks work with standard queen bedding and sheets?", "a": "Yes, despite being engineered specifically for the fold mechanism, both mattresses are designed to fit standard queen dimensions, so regular queen sheets and bedding should work normally." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing weight ratings between hardware kits and complete beds?", "a": "Assuming a hardware kit's much higher rating, like the Wilding Wallbeds' 2,000 lb slat system rating, means it's proportionally 'twice as strong' as a complete bed rated for 1000 lbs, when these figures actually measure different things, bare hardware versus a fully assembled cabinet structure." },
  { "q": "Is the Hlivelood pick worth it over the cheaper CECER option?", "a": "If you specifically want maximum flanking storage cabinets with LED lighting, yes, but if a complete mattress-included bundle with practical in-bed charging matters more, the CECER pick covers that for about $270 less." },
  { "q": "How do I confirm the Wilding Wallbeds kit will actually fit inside my existing closet as advertised?", "a": "Measure your closet's interior width, depth, and height against the kit's stated queen mattress dimensions plus mechanism clearance space before ordering, since closet dimensions vary significantly between homes." },
  { "q": "Can the PUREMIND's freestanding design be moved to a different room later without issues?", "a": "Yes, since it doesn't require wall anchoring, it can be relocated more easily than a wall-mounted design, though its substantial size and weight still make it a two-person job to move safely." },
  { "q": "Do any of these murphy beds at this tier require an electrician for the built-in charging or LED features?", "a": "No, both the Hlivelood's LED lights and the CECER's USB and AC charging ports are designed to plug into a standard wall outlet, requiring no electrical work or professional installation for those specific features." }
