export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "Are wooden footrests better than foam footrests?",
    a: "Wooden footrests last longer without compression changes and maintain consistent rocking feel over years of use. Foam footrests are softer underfoot, quieter, and better for bare-foot users. Wood is the better long-term investment for users who prioritize durability. Foam is better for immediate comfort and bare-foot use.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between bamboo and hardwood footrests?",
    a: "Bamboo is a fast-growing grass that behaves like hardwood in finished products. It is slightly lighter than most hardwoods and has an eco-friendly appeal due to faster growth cycles. In terms of durability and rocking performance, bamboo and hardwood are comparable for desk footrest use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do wooden footrests scratch hardwood floors?",
    a: "Wood rockers on bare hardwood floors can leave marks over time, particularly at the contact points of the curved base. Placing a thin desk mat or floor protector under the footrest prevents this. Models with rubber feet or pads reduce direct wood-on-floor contact.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is cherry wood the best option for desk footrests?",
    a: "Cherry wood is a mid-hardness hardwood that is durable, visually warm, and commonly used in desk furniture. Other hardwoods perform similarly. The choice between cherry and lauan plywood affects aesthetics more than performance. Solid cherry wood tends to be more visually refined than plywood alternatives.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a 350 lb capacity mean for a footrest?",
    a: "The 350-pound capacity on StrongTek models reflects the maximum weight load the footrest can support without structural failure. For standard desk use, the relevant load is the weight of the user's feet, which is a small fraction of total body weight. A high capacity rating indicates structural robustness.",
