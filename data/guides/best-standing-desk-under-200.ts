The trade-offs (single motor, 1-year warranty, particle board desktop) do not eliminate that value for light to moderate use. For dual large-monitor setups or users over 6 feet 2 inches, the under-$300 tier addresses those specific limitations.",

    q: "What is the best standing desk under $200?",

  },
  {
    q: "Do standing desks under $200 wobble?",
    a: "Yes - all single-motor 2-stage electric desks have some wobble at maximum extension. This is a structural characteristic of the 2-stage column design. For a single-monitor setup the motion is generally slow and not distracting. For two 32-inch or larger monitors, the combined weight and leverage makes wobble more noticeable. Dual-motor desks starting around $280-300 address this for heavy setups.",

    q: "Is 48x24 big enough for a standing desk?",
    a: "A 48x24 desk is comfortable for a single-monitor setup with keyboard, mouse, and laptop. It becomes tight for two 27-inch or larger monitors side by side, and the 24-inch depth places large monitors closer than some ergonomics guides recommend. For a dual large-monitor setup, check 55-inch or 60-inch desks in the $300 tier.",

  {
    q: "What is the weight limit for these desks?",
    a: "Most desks in this guide are rated at 176 lbs, well above any realistic home office setup. The exception is the SHW 48x24 with Drawer at 110 lbs due to its built-in drawer mechanism. A typical home office load - two 27-inch monitors (12-15 lbs each), a laptop (4-5 lbs), keyboard, mouse, and accessories (5-10 lbs) - totals roughly 35-45 lbs, well within the 110 lb SHW limit for standard setups.",
