export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "OpenWrt Support Determines How Much You Can Customize the Router, but Also How Complex Setup Becomes",
    "explanation": "OpenWrt is an open-source router firmware that unlocks thousands of installable plug-ins and deep configuration control over VPN routing, firewall rules, and network behavior, but this same depth means a first-time user faces more settings and terminology than a simplified mode-based interface presents. This matters significantly if you want to customize VPN split-tunneling or install ad-blocking software directly on the router, and matters less if you just want a private network that works reliably out of the box. Check whether a travel router explicitly supports OpenWrt if customization is a priority, or explicitly favor a non-OpenWrt model if straightforward setup matters more to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pre-Installed VPN Clients Save Real Setup Time Compared to Manually Configuring VPN Software Yourself",
    "explanation": "A router with OpenVPN and WireGuard pre-installed and compatible with 30+ VPN providers lets you simply log into your existing VPN subscription rather than manually installing and configuring VPN client software on the router's firmware from scratch, a real time saver especially while traveling with limited time or unfamiliar network conditions. This matters significantly if you already have an active VPN subscription you want to run at the router level rather than per-device, and matters less if you don't currently use a VPN service. Check whether your specific VPN provider is named in a router's compatibility list before assuming any travel router works seamlessly with your existing subscription."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wired Uplink Port Speed Matters More Than Wireless Speed When Connecting to a Hotel's Ethernet Jack",
    "explanation": "Many hotels and short-term rentals still provide a single wired Ethernet port for internet access, meaning the travel router's wired WAN port speed, whether standard Gigabit or the faster 2.5G found on some models, determines your actual maximum internet speed regardless of how fast the router's Wi-Fi radio itself is rated. This matters more if you're a frequent traveler who values consistently fast wired connections in properties with capable internet infrastructure, and matters less if you're primarily connecting to a hotel's existing Wi-Fi rather than an Ethernet jack. Check the router's wired WAN port speed specifically, not just its wireless speed rating, if maximizing wired hotel internet throughput matters to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Travel Router Is Not the Same Product Category as a Mobile Hotspot or Mi-Fi Device",
    "explanation": "A travel router requires an existing internet source, either a wired Ethernet connection, a public Wi-Fi network, or a tethered phone connection, and then creates its own private secured network from that source, while a mobile hotspot or Mi-Fi device has its own cellular data connection built in and doesn't require an existing network to connect to. This matters significantly if you're traveling somewhere without any existing Wi-Fi or Ethernet access and specifically need cellular data capability, which a standard travel router cannot provide on its own. Confirm you have or will have access to an existing internet source at your destination before assuming a travel router alone solves your connectivity need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C Power Input Compatibility With a Standard Power Bank Adds Real Flexibility for Travel Without a Wall Outlet",
    "explanation": "A travel router that specifically accepts standard 5V/3A USB-C PD power, like the TP-Link Roam 6 pick, can be powered from any compatible portable power bank rather than requiring a dedicated wall adapter or proprietary power connector, useful in a vehicle, train, or location without a convenient outlet nearby. This matters more if you travel by car, train, or in locations with limited outlet access, and matters less if you're always near a standard wall outlet during use. Check a travel router's specific power input requirements if powering it from a portable battery source is a realistic scenario for your travel style."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the difference between a travel router and a mobile hotspot?", "a": "A travel router needs an existing internet source, like a hotel Ethernet port or public Wi-Fi, to create its own private secured network, while a mobile hotspot has its own built-in cellular data connection and doesn't require an existing network." },
  { "q": "Do I need OpenWrt support in a travel router?", "a": "Only if you want deep customization like custom VPN routing rules or additional installed software; most travelers do fine with a simpler mode-based router that skips OpenWrt entirely for easier setup." },
  { "q": "Can a travel router improve hotel Wi-Fi speed?", "a": "No, a travel router cannot make a slow hotel connection faster; it converts a shared or public connection into your own private, more secure network, which can sometimes reduce congestion from other users sharing the same hotel Wi-Fi." },
  { "q": "How do I set up a travel router in a hotel room?", "a": "Connect the router to the hotel's Ethernet port if available, or use its hotspot/repeater mode to connect to the hotel's Wi-Fi network, then connect your own devices to the router's newly created private network." },
  { "q": "Is Wi-Fi 6 necessary for a travel router?", "a": "Wi-Fi 6 provides better performance for multiple simultaneous devices or high-bandwidth activities like video calls and streaming, but a Wi-Fi 5 or AC-standard router is often sufficient for basic browsing and email while traveling." },
  { "q": "Can I run a VPN on a travel router instead of installing it on each device?", "a": "Yes, most modern travel routers with pre-installed VPN client support let you configure your VPN subscription once at the router level, automatically securing every device that connects to it without individual per-device setup." }
