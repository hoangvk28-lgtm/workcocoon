    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer with automatic document feeder holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer with automatic document feeder over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    q: "Why did my document come out of the ADF crooked?",
    a: "Skew is more common on budget ADF mechanisms than premium ones. If you scan important documents regularly, a mid-tier pick like the HP OfficeJet Pro 8125e generally handles alignment better than the cheapest ADF options.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a duplex ADF and a single-sided ADF?",
    a: "A duplex ADF scans both sides of each page automatically in one pass through the feeder. A single-sided ADF only scans one side per pass, requiring you to manually flip the stack and run it through again for the second side, a real time cost on longer double-sided documents.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is ADF scanning louder than flatbed scanning?",
    a: "Yes, the mechanical feeding process of an ADF is noticeably louder than the quiet pass of a flatbed scan head. If your desk doubles as a video call space, plan to batch ADF scans outside of meeting times.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my ADF jam more often than the paper tray?",
    a: "ADF jams are more common than paper tray jams because the feed mechanism handles thinner sheets moving through rollers rather than sitting flat. Creased paper, stray staples, or paper that's too thin are the most common causes, remove staples and straighten your stack before loading it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the Brother INKvestment 4555 have an automatic document feeder?",
    a: "The listing highlights its 2.7-inch color touchscreen and 2 paper trays but doesn't explicitly confirm an ADF in the title. Brother's MFC-series printers commonly include one, but confirm this spec on the full product page before buying if an ADF is a must-have feature for you.",
