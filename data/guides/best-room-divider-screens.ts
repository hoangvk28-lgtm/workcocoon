  {
    "criterion": "Check freestanding stability against your actual floor type, not just an empty room demo",
    "explanation": "A freestanding divider relies entirely on its own base footprint and panel angle for stability, with no wall support, and how well it actually stays upright varies depending on floor type, a divider that stands solidly on carpet can behave differently on hardwood or tile, and panels catching a draft from an HVAC vent can wobble more than expected.\n\nThis matters because a divider that looks stable in a still product photo can still tip or shift with regular foot traffic brushing past it.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world stability mentions on floor types similar to yours, and check the base footprint width relative to the divider's height, since a taller divider needs a wider base to stay stable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm genuine sound dampening if acoustic privacy is the actual goal, not just visual blocking",
    "explanation": "A room divider marketed as \"acoustic\" should use a real sound-dampening material, typically a felt or fabric-wrapped panel core, that measurably reduces noise transmission, distinct from a simple solid panel or bookcase that only blocks the sightline without doing anything meaningful for sound.\n\nThis distinction matters directly if noise reduction for calls or focused work is your actual goal, since a purely visual divider does very little to dampen adjacent conversation or ambient noise regardless of how solid it looks.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated acoustic material, not just the word \"acoustic\" in the title with no supporting material description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match panel height to your ceiling and the actual privacy level you need",
    "explanation": "Panel height determines both visual privacy and how much of the room's overall openness the divider preserves, a shorter divider maintains more light and airflow but offers less real privacy, while a taller divider that extends closer to the ceiling gives stronger separation at the cost of feeling like a more permanent wall.\n\nThis matters more in a room with a high ceiling, where a standard-height divider can look and feel undersized, and less in a room with a standard 8-foot ceiling where most divider heights work proportionally.\n\nCheck the listed divider height against your room's actual ceiling height and how much visual openness you want to preserve, not just the divider's general size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh assembly and mounting requirements against whether you're renting or own the space",
    "explanation": "Room dividers span a wide range of setup requirements, from a no-drill freestanding panel that requires zero installation to a wall-mounted or track-based divider requiring drilling and potentially professional installation, and which one is appropriate depends heavily on whether you're in a rented space where drilling isn't an option, or a space you own where a more permanent installation is fine.\n\nThis matters directly for a renter, discovering after purchase that a divider requires wall-mounting hardware is a real and avoidable problem in a space where drilling isn't allowed.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for the mounting method, freestanding, no-drill, or requiring wall anchors, before ordering, especially in a rented space."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider mobility needs if the divider will move between rooms or configurations regularly",
    "explanation": "A divider on wheels or casters can be repositioned easily between rooms or reconfigured for different layouts throughout the week, useful for anyone who needs flexible zoning rather than a permanent room split, but wheels also mean the divider is inherently less stable than a fixed-base design and can shift underfoot if bumped.\n\nThis matters more if you genuinely need to move the divider often, like separating a home office from a living space only during work hours, less if it'll stay in one position long-term.\n\nCheck whether casters are lockable to prevent unwanted movement once positioned, and weigh mobility against the reduced stability it typically brings."

    q: "Do room divider screens block sound?",
    a: "Not meaningfully. Every material in this list, rice paper, fabric, rattan, wood mesh, or acrylic, creates a visual break in a room but doesn't stop sound the way a solid wall or bookcase would. If noise separation is the priority, pair a screen with soft furnishings like rugs or curtains rather than relying on the panels alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "How should I position a folding screen so it doesn't tip over?",
    a: "Stand it in a zigzag or gentle curve rather than a flat straight line, this widens its effective base and makes it far harder to knock over, especially in homes with kids or pets. Placing it against a wall or in a corner is even more stable since one side is naturally braced.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I maintain a traditional shoji paper screen?",
    a: "Dust it monthly with a soft brush and spot-clean with a dry microfiber cloth only, never water, alcohol, or abrasive cleaners. In sun-exposed rooms, expect to replace the rice paper roughly every 18-24 months as it yellows or tears. If that maintenance sounds like too much, a synthetic fabric or acrylic screen needs far less upkeep, though synthetic panels can turn brittle or cloudy after 3-5 years of sustained UV exposure.",

    q: "Is an acrylic screen better than a traditional wood and paper screen?",
    a: "It depends on your priorities. The Svimi acrylic screen is roughly 3 times more durable than glass, shatter-resistant, and needs no periodic paper replacement, making it the lowest-maintenance pick in this list. But it costs more and lacks the warm, traditional look of the Roundhill shoji screens, which remain the more authentic choice if aesthetics matter more than upkeep.",

    q: "Which room divider screen is best for a wide room?",
    a: "The VEVOR 6-Panel spans 95.3 inches wide, the widest in this list, making it the best fit for open-concept rooms where a standard 4-panel screen wouldn't stretch far enough. Most other picks here use 4 panels and top out around 63-72 inches wide.",
