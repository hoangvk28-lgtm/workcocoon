export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Price Alone Doesn't Tell You Whether the Graphics Card and Power Supply Are Included",
    "explanation": "The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma is a complete, immediately usable docking station, while the PELADN, Plugable, and Razer Core X V2 picks are all specifically eGPU enclosures that require you to separately purchase both a graphics card and, in most cases, a power supply, meaning their listed prices represent only a fraction of the total real cost to get a working eGPU setup. This matters significantly when comparing prices across these four picks, where the cheapest-looking enclosure might actually cost more in total once you add a GPU and PSU than a pricier complete docking station. Check specifically whether a listing includes the graphics card and power supply or requires them as separate purchases before comparing prices as if they represented complete, equivalent solutions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum Supported GPU Size in Slots and Millimeters Determines Whether Your Specific Card Will Physically Fit",
    "explanation": "The Razer Core X V2 specifically supports graphics cards up to 3.5 slots wide, while the Plugable pick specifically states GPU dimensions must not exceed 346mm x 170mm x 77mm and 3.5 slots, concrete physical measurements that matter directly if you already own or are planning to buy a specific large, modern flagship graphics card. This matters significantly for today's largest triple-fan and quad-fan GPU designs, which can exceed these limits, and matters less if you're using a more compact, single or dual-fan card. Measure your specific graphics card's exact dimensions and slot width against an enclosure's stated maximum size limits before assuming any eGPU enclosure will physically accommodate your chosen card."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Local AI Model Hosting Requires Specific Software Compatibility Beyond Just Raw GPU Power",
    "explanation": "The Plugable AI eGPU Enclosure specifically confirms compatibility with named local AI tools including Ollama, LM Studio, Foundry Local, NVIDIA NIM, and llama.cpp, a genuine software ecosystem consideration beyond simply having enough GPU horsepower, since running AI models privately and offline requires these specific compatible software frameworks. This matters significantly if you specifically want to run local AI models with complete data privacy and no cloud dependency, where confirmed software framework compatibility is essential, and matters less if you're purchasing an eGPU enclosure purely for gaming performance. Check whether an eGPU enclosure or its documentation specifically names compatible AI software frameworks if local AI model hosting is a genuine part of your intended use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Windows-Only Compatibility Excludes Mac, Linux, and ChromeOS Users Regardless of Thunderbolt 5 Support",
    "explanation": "The Plugable AI eGPU Enclosure explicitly requires Windows 11 and states it is not compatible with macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, or Thunderbolt 3, a real platform restriction that applies even though the enclosure itself uses genuine Thunderbolt 5 technology that other platforms could theoretically support. This matters significantly if you're on a Mac or Linux system and shopping based on Thunderbolt 5 compatibility alone, where this specific enclosure simply won't work regardless of your host's own port capability, and matters less if you're already committed to a Windows 11 system. Check a Thunderbolt 5 eGPU enclosure's specific stated operating system requirements, not just its Thunderbolt version, since Thunderbolt 5 support doesn't guarantee cross-platform compatibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Active Cooling With an Automatic Load-Responsive Fan Balances Performance Against Noise",
    "explanation": "The Razer Core X V2's integrated 120mm fan specifically activates automatically under high loads with an adjustable fan curve, letting you balance maximum cooling performance against acceptable noise levels depending on your specific workload and environment. This matters if you run demanding, sustained GPU workloads where consistent cooling prevents thermal throttling, and matters less for lighter, intermittent gaming sessions where passive or minimal active cooling is usually sufficient. Check whether an eGPU enclosure's cooling system activates automatically based on load and whether the fan curve is user-adjustable if noise management alongside sustained performance matters for your specific setup."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need to buy a graphics card separately for any of these picks?", "a": "Yes, three of the four picks in this comparison (PELADN, Plugable, and Razer Core X V2) are dedicated eGPU enclosures that specifically require you to purchase a graphics card separately, while only the Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma is a complete, ready-to-use docking station without a discrete GPU slot." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Thunderbolt 5 gaming or eGPU dock?", "a": "Comparing the listed prices of complete docking stations against bare eGPU enclosures as if they were equivalent products, without accounting for the additional cost of a graphics card and power supply required to make an eGPU enclosure functional." },
  { "q": "Is the Plugable AI eGPU Enclosure worth its high price if I only want to game, not run AI models?", "a": "If you don't specifically need local AI model hosting, the PELADN S-3 or Razer Core X V2 deliver similar core eGPU functionality for gaming at a lower price, making the Plugable's premium primarily justified by its specific AI workload features." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Razer Core X V2 with my Steam Deck or ROG Ally?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically confirms compatibility with USB4 gaming handhelds alongside Thunderbolt 4 and 5 laptops, though checking your specific handheld's own eGPU support in its manufacturer documentation is worth doing before purchase." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my graphics card will fit in the PELADN S-3 enclosure?", "a": "Checking your specific GPU's dimensions and slot width against the PELADN's stated PCIe 4.0 x4 slot compatibility and ATX power supply length limit of 180mm is worth doing, since not every large modern GPU will fit every enclosure's physical constraints." },
  { "q": "Does the Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma add real gaming GPU performance like a dedicated eGPU enclosure?", "a": "No, the Razer Chroma is a docking station with display, storage, and connectivity features, but it does not include a discrete GPU slot, so it won't add desktop-class graphics performance the way the PELADN, Plugable, or Razer Core X V2 eGPU enclosures can with a properly installed graphics card." }
