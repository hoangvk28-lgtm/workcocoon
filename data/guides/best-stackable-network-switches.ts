export const howToChoose: HowToChooseSection[] = [
  {
    "subheading": "Hardware Stacking vs Controller Management",
    "intro": "Genuine hardware stacking (found in Cisco Meraki MS210/MS225, higher-end Aruba, and some Arista lines) combines physical switches into one logical unit with shared backplane bandwidth. The Ubiquiti and Aruba Instant On switches in this list instead unify under one software dashboard, which covers most SMB needs without the premium of true stacking hardware.",
    "note": "If you specifically need true hardware stacking with combined backplane bandwidth, that's a genuine enterprise feature set found in Cisco Meraki's stacking-capable models, not the budget-to-midrange switches most of this cluster covers."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Port count is a headroom decision, not a current-need one",
    "explanation": "Buy for what you'll plug in over the next 2-3 years, not just today. An 8-port switch that's already full the day it arrives means buying a second switch and daisy-chaining, which adds a hop of latency and another point of failure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE budget is a shared pool, not per-port",
    "explanation": "A switch rated for 8 PoE+ ports at 120W total does not mean every port gets 30W simultaneously. Add up the real draw of every camera, AP, and phone you'll connect, and make sure the total budget clears it with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Managed vs unmanaged changes what you can diagnose later",
    "explanation": "An unmanaged switch is zero-configuration but gives you no visibility when something goes wrong. A smart-managed switch adds VLANs, port mirroring, and traffic monitoring for a modest price increase, worth it the first time you need to isolate a misbehaving device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless does not always mean silent under load",
    "explanation": "Most desktop switches are genuinely fanless and silent, but high-port-count PoE switches sometimes add active cooling once the power budget climbs past 200-300W. Check for a fan explicitly if a quiet office or bedroom install matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speed needs matching cable and network gear",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G or 10G switch only delivers those speeds if your cabling is Cat5e or better (Cat6a for 10G) and the devices on both ends actually support that speed. Mixing a multi-gig switch into an all-Gigabit network gets you nothing extra."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Renewed enterprise gear needs a licensing check first",
    "explanation": "Cisco Meraki, Juniper, and some Aruba/HPE switches on Amazon are frequently sold as renewed hardware without an active license or support contract. Confirm what functions before assuming a discounted enterprise switch works like a new one out of the box."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I actually need true hardware stacking?",
    "a": "Rarely, outside of enterprise data centers. Controller-managed switches like UniFi or Aruba Instant On give you a single management view across multiple switches without the premium cost of true stacking hardware, which covers the vast majority of homelab and SMB use cases."
