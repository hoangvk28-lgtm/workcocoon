export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Is a pull-out or detachable footrest better?", a: "Pull-out footrests, like on the RESPAWN 110 Pro, are more convenient for frequent use since they're always attached and slide out on a track. Detachable footrests, like the LEMBERI's, let you remove the footrest entirely for a cleaner look when you don't need it. Choose based on how often you expect to actually use the footrest." },
  { q: "Do footrest chairs recline further than regular gaming chairs?", a: "Not necessarily, but the best footrest chairs pair a wide recline range with the footrest so you can actually lean back and rest your legs. The RESPAWN 110 Pro reclines to 155 degrees and the GTPLAYER Big & Tall to 150 degrees, both deep enough to make the footrest genuinely useful rather than decorative." },
  { q: "Can a footrest chair replace a recliner for console gaming?", a: "The RESPAWN 900 is purpose-built for this, using a pedestal base and full-body recliner design instead of a standard desk chair frame. The other seven chairs in this guide are desk-style gaming chairs that happen to include a footrest, which work fine for casual recline but aren't a true recliner replacement." },
  { q: "Does a massage lumbar feature affect footrest chair durability?", a: "The massage motor itself is a separate component from the footrest mechanism, so it doesn't affect footrest durability directly. Based on product specs and buyer feedback, the LEMBERI, Dowinx, and Yaheetech all combine massage lumbar with footrests, and the massage motor is more likely than the footrest track to wear out first over years of use." },
  { q: "What weight capacity should I look for in a footrest gaming chair?", a: "Look for a capacity comfortably above your body weight, since the footrest bears extra downward stress under heavier users. The GTPLAYER and LEMBERI both offer 400 lb capacity, the highest in this guide, while most other picks range from 275 to 350 lbs." },
