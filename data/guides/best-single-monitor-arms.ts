export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your desk can actually grip the mounting base before comparing arms",
    "explanation": "A monitor arm's clamp or grommet base needs a solid desk edge to grip securely, and this is the real first question to answer before comparing gas spring tension or weight capacity, since a hollow honeycomb-core desktop, a glass top, or a desk under about an inch thick can rule out an entire category of arms regardless of how good the arm itself is.\n\nThis matters because discovering after purchase that your desk simply can't mount the arm you bought is a common and entirely avoidable problem.\n\nCheck your desk's actual edge thickness and construction (solid, hollow-core, or glass), and confirm the arm's clamp or grommet base is explicitly rated for that construction before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check real per-arm weight capacity, not the bundled-stand weight printed on the monitor box",
    "explanation": "Monitor weight ratings printed on the box often reference the monitor's included stand, not the bare panel weight relevant to a monitor arm, and a monitor arm's real weight capacity needs to match your specific monitor's actual panel weight without its stand, information usually found in the monitor's separate spec sheet rather than the box itself.\n\nThis matters directly for a larger or ultrawide monitor, where the gap between stand-inclusive and bare-panel weight can be substantial enough to matter.\n\nCheck your monitor's bare panel weight (without its stand) in its official spec sheet, and compare that specifically against the arm's rated capacity, not a generalized weight class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify VESA compatibility for both your monitor and the arm's mounting plate",
    "explanation": "VESA mounting patterns come in a few standard sizes (75x75mm and 100x100mm are most common), and a mismatch between your monitor's VESA pattern and the arm's mounting plate means the arm simply won't attach, some arms include an adapter for multiple patterns while others support only one.\n\nThis matters directly for a monitor with a non-standard or larger VESA pattern, particularly some ultrawide or curved monitors, where assuming universal compatibility can lead to an unusable purchase.\n\nCheck your monitor's specific VESA pattern in its spec sheet, and confirm the arm explicitly supports that pattern, either natively or with an included adapter, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand gas spring tension and how it affects long-term reliability",
    "explanation": "A gas spring monitor arm relies on an internal pressurized cylinder to hold the monitor at any height with minimal effort, and tension needs to be roughly matched to your monitor's actual weight, a monitor lighter than the spring's calibrated range can drift upward on its own, while pressure calibrated too low for a heavier monitor won't hold position and will slowly droop.\n\nThis matters for long-term usability, not just initial setup, since gas springs can also lose tension gradually over years of use.\n\nCheck the arm's rated weight range against your monitor's actual weight, favoring a monitor that falls comfortably within the middle of that range rather than at either extreme."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider reach and range of motion against your actual desk depth and seating position",
    "explanation": "An arm's horizontal reach and vertical range of motion determine how far the monitor can extend from the mounting point and how much height adjustment is available, and these dimensions matter differently depending on your desk depth and how far back you sit, a shallow desk needs less reach than a deep one, and a standing desk that changes height throughout the day needs a wider vertical range to stay at eye level.\n\nThis matters more for anyone switching between sitting and standing regularly, less for a fixed single seated position.\n\nCheck the arm's listed reach and height range against your actual desk depth and how much your seated or standing eye level varies throughout the day."

  {
    q: "Why does my monitor arm slowly droop over time?",
    a: "This is gas spring sag, a normal result of a year or two of daily height and angle adjustments rather than a defect. Some premium arms, like the Ergotron LX and LX Pro in this list, include a retightenable tension-adjustment screw at the joint that can correct it. Budget arms typically lack that adjustment and need replacing once sag sets in.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much reach do I need for my desk?",
    a: "As a rule of thumb, plan for roughly 20cm of reach on a 60cm-deep desk, or 35-40cm on an 80cm-deep desk. Check the arm's maximum reach spec against your desk's real depth, not just the monitor size range it's rated for.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my monitor arm wobble when I type?",
    a: "Some wobble is normal on any arm when you type on a mechanical keyboard or lean on the desk, but cheaper arms wobble noticeably more than premium ones. If you type heavily every day, the HUANUO TitanLift's aluminum build or an Ergotron pick holds steadier than the lightest budget clamps.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mount a curved monitor on any of these arms?",
    a: "Only the Ergotron LX and LX Pro in this list are explicitly rated for curved and ultrawide panels, which are heavier and have a different center of gravity than flat monitors. The other picks here are built and tested around standard flat screens.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a different arm for a standing desk?",
    a: "A standing desk arm goes through far more repeated height changes than a stationary desk setup, which puts more strain on a basic gas spring. The HUANUO FlowLift Pro's smoother MechaSpring mechanism or an Ergotron pick handles that repeated adjustment better than a fixed-tension budget arm.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a longer warranty mean the arm won't sag over time?",
    a: "No. A long warranty, like Ergotron's on the LX and LX Pro, covers manufacturing defects, not the normal gas spring sag that happens naturally after years of adjustment. That's a separate issue from what the warranty is designed to cover.",
