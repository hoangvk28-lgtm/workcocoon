export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Plan around real usable capacity, not the number printed on the box",
    "explanation": "Storage manufacturers advertise capacity in decimal gigabytes and terabytes (1 GB equals 1,000,000,000 bytes), but operating systems report free space in binary units (1 GB equals 1,073,741,824 bytes), and on top of that gap, formatting itself consumes a further slice of raw capacity for the file system's own bookkeeping.\n\nTogether these two factors mean a drive advertised as 1TB will typically show up as roughly 930GB in your file explorer, a genuinely predictable shortfall rather than a defect, but one that catches buyers off guard if they plan their storage needs around the advertised round number.\n\nBefore buying, mentally subtract roughly 7 percent from the advertised capacity to estimate real usable space, and size up a tier if your actual storage need is close to the advertised number rather than comfortably under it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the NAND flash type where the manufacturer discloses it",
    "explanation": "NAND flash memory, the actual chip technology storing your data, comes in different types based on how many bits each memory cell stores, with TLC (three bits per cell) generally offering better sustained write speed and longer-term endurance than QLC (four bits per cell), which packs more capacity per chip but at the cost of slower performance once any built-in cache is exhausted.\n\nThis matters concretely because many drives use a small pool of faster cache memory to accelerate the beginning of a transfer, and once that cache fills during a large or sustained copy, the drive falls back to its native NAND speed, which is a much bigger drop on a QLC drive than a TLC one, sometimes cutting write speed by more than half.\n\nManufacturers don't always advertise NAND type prominently, so check the product listing's technical details or search the model number alongside \"NAND type\" before assuming a drive uses the faster TLC type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your device's actual port and cable support the drive's rated speed",
    "explanation": "A portable SSD's rated speed, such as 1050MB/s or 2000MB/s, is the maximum the drive's own controller can achieve, but real-world speed is always capped by the slowest link in the chain: the drive itself, the cable connecting it, and the port on your computer or console, whichever of the three supports the lowest maximum speed.\n\nThis means a genuinely fast 2000MB/s-rated drive plugged into an older USB 3.0 port, or connected with a cable rated for a lower USB generation, will perform no better than a much cheaper drive rated for that lower speed, making the expensive drive's extra speed ceiling completely wasted money in that specific setup.\n\nCheck your computer, phone, or console's actual port specification (not just its connector shape, since USB-C and USB-A shapes don't indicate speed) and confirm any cable you use is rated for that same speed tier before expecting a fast drive's full rated performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that a drive's speed rating reflects a burst, not sustained performance",
    "explanation": "The headline speed figure on a portable SSD's packaging is typically measured using a short benchmark that primarily tests the drive's fast cache memory, not its sustained real-world performance across a large, continuous file transfer that runs long enough to exhaust that cache.\n\nThis is the single most common reason a portable SSD feels slower in real use than its marketing suggests: copying a single large video file or a folder of thousands of photos can run well past the point where the cache empties, causing the transfer to visibly slow down partway through, something a short benchmark screenshot never reveals.\n\nIf your actual use case involves large sustained transfers, specifically look for reviews or listings that mention sustained write speed after cache exhaustion, not just the peak burst number on the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Compare warranty length as a genuine (if imperfect) signal of manufacturer confidence",
    "explanation": "A storage device's warranty length, commonly ranging from one to five years across different brands and models even at similar price points, reflects the manufacturer's own actuarial confidence in how long that specific NAND and controller combination will reliably hold data, since a company offering a longer warranty is accepting more financial risk on a component they presumably trust more.\n\nThis isn't a perfect signal on its own, a shorter warranty doesn't automatically mean an unreliable drive, but at a similar price point between two otherwise comparable drives, the one backed by a longer warranty is making a more concrete promise about its own longevity rather than just a marketing claim.\n\nCheck the stated warranty length directly in the listing or manufacturer's spec sheet, and weigh it alongside NAND type and brand reputation rather than treating any single signal as decisive on its own."
