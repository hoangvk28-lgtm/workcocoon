      "The PIXMA TS4320 is a compact color inkjet that handles occasional cardstock projects like greeting cards and light invitations through its standard tray, with duplex printing for two-sided cards. Inkjet's mechanical print process is gentler on thick stock than a laser fuser, so cards come out flat rather than warped.\n\nIt is a general-purpose home printer rather than a cardstock specialist, so buyers running frequent heavy stock jobs should expect to check the manual for the maximum supported weight before loading anything past standard cardstock. At this price it is best treated as a starter option for occasional craft projects, not a daily invitation-printing workhorse.\n\nA genuine advantage here is that inkjet avoids the heat-warping risk of laser on thick stock.

It remains a general home AIO printer rather than a specialty cardstock printer, so heavier stock beyond typical greeting-card weight is not guaranteed to feed reliably.\n\nWorth calling out specifically: duplex printing for two-sided cards.

    "explanation": "Listings for a printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "What is the maximum cardstock weight a home printer can handle?",
    a: "Most standard trays top out around 65lb to 80lb cardstock, while a rear straight-through feed slot, when a printer has one, can often handle up to 100lb to 110lb because the paper travels in a straight line rather than curving through rollers. None of the printers in this list advertise a dedicated heavy-media slot, so 80lb is a practical ceiling for reliable results.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does laser or inkjet work better for cardstock?",
    a: "Inkjet generally has an edge for cardstock because it uses a cooler mechanical process, avoiding the heat-warping risk that a laser printer's fuser can cause on stock over roughly 80lb. Laser, like the Brother DCP-L2640DW in this list, still works well for lighter black-and-white cardstock where crisp, smudge-proof text matters more than color.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my printer jam or refuse to pull cardstock?",
    a: "Some printers have an internal paper-thickness lever or gap setting that needs adjusting before thick stock will feed correctly, and skipping this step is a common cause of jams. Also check that you're using the correct tray or feed path, since a curved standard tray struggles more with thick stock than a straight-through path.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a special printer setting for cardstock?",
    a: "Yes, selecting the cardstock or heavy-media option in your print driver instead of plain paper adjusts ink volume and drying behavior appropriately. Skipping this step, especially on inkjet, can result in under-saturated colors or ink that takes longer to dry and smudges when stacked.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an ink-tank printer worth it for cardstock printing?",
    a: "If you print cardstock regularly, yes. Cardstock projects use more ink per page than plain paper due to larger solid-color areas, and a refillable ink-tank printer like the EcoTank ET-2800 or MegaTank G3270 keeps per-page cost low compared to cartridge-based inkjets, which get expensive fast at volume.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I test cardstock before printing a full batch of invitations?",
    a: "Yes, always print one test sheet of your specific cardstock first. Feed reliability, color output, and drying time can vary by texture, coating, and humidity even on printers rated to handle cardstock well, and a single test sheet catches problems before they cost you a whole batch of paper.",
