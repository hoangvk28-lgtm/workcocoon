export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "BIFMA X5.1 and Component-Level Certifications Test Fundamentally Different Scopes",
    "explanation": "BIFMA X5.1, the certification the CAPOT pick specifically cites, is a comprehensive structural durability standard for the entire office chair assembly, covering frame strength, base stability, and mechanism durability under repeated stress testing, while an SGS certification like the HUANUO's typically verifies specific components or safety aspects rather than the complete structural assembly. Neither certification is invalid, but they answer different questions about a chair's long-term reliability, and a buyer prioritizing years of heavy daily use should weigh the more comprehensive BIFMA standard more heavily. Check which specific certification a listing names and understand its actual testing scope rather than treating any named certification as interchangeable proof of quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Chair's Weight Capacity Should Include Meaningful Headroom Above Your Actual Body Weight, Not Just Meet It",
    "explanation": "The CAPOT pick's 400 lb capacity provides substantial headroom for most users, while a chair rated at 300 lbs, like the HUANUO pick, still comfortably serves someone weighing 200 lbs but leaves less margin for someone closer to that stated maximum. Operating a chair's gas lift and frame consistently near its rated capacity accelerates wear on those components compared to operating well within the rated range. Choose a chair with a stated capacity comfortably above your actual weight, not simply equal to or barely above it, for better long-term durability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An 8-Level Lumbar Micro-Adjust System Offers Genuinely Finer Control Than a Continuous Two-Direction Range Alone",
    "explanation": "The CAPOT pick's lumbar system specifically offers 8 distinct adjustment levels within its 2 inch range, a more granular stepped system than the Marsail and HUANUO picks' continuous but less explicitly stepped 1.18 and 2.16 inch adjustment ranges. More discrete levels can make it easier to find and remember your exact preferred setting, especially if multiple people share the same chair and need to reset it to their own preference repeatedly. Consider whether stepped, memorable adjustment levels matter more to your use case than a continuous but less clearly marked range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Year Warranty With Complimentary Part Replacements Is a Genuinely Different Commitment Than a Standard Return Window",
    "explanation": "The CAPOT pick's 5-year warranty specifically promises complimentary part replacements, a real ongoing commitment beyond the initial 30 to 90-day return window most budget chairs offer, and this matters given that a chair's gas lift, casters, and mesh material all experience gradual wear over years of daily use. A chair without a similarly extended warranty may still be well-built, but you're taking on more risk if a component fails after the standard return period closes. Weigh a documented multi-year warranty as a real value factor, not just a marketing bullet point, when the price difference between chairs is otherwise modest relative to years of expected use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Body Support Points and Precise Lumbar Measurements Represent Two Different Design Philosophies Worth Distinguishing",
    "explanation": "The FelixKing pick emphasizes 5 named support points, head, shoulder, back, hips, and hands, as its core design philosophy, while the CAPOT, Marsail, and HUANUO picks emphasize precise numeric lumbar and armrest adjustment ranges instead. Neither approach is objectively superior, but they suit different buyer priorities: broad zone coverage versus precise, measurable customization of specific adjustment points. Consider whether you have one specific problem area, like lower back pain, that benefits more from precise adjustment, or whether you want broader coverage across multiple body zones simultaneously."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is BIFMA X5.1 certification meaningfully better than SGS certification for an office chair?", "a": "They test different scopes, BIFMA X5.1 covers the complete structural assembly's durability under repeated stress, while SGS typically verifies specific components or safety aspects, so BIFMA offers more comprehensive structural assurance, though SGS is still a legitimate third-party credential." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing weight capacity across office chairs?", "a": "Choosing a chair rated barely above their actual body weight rather than one with meaningful headroom, since operating near a chair's rated maximum accelerates wear on the gas lift and frame compared to staying comfortably within the rated range." },
  { "q": "Is the CAPOT chair worth the price premium over the Marsail or HUANUO picks?", "a": "If you want the highest weight capacity, the most granular 8-level lumbar adjustment, and a documented 5-year warranty with part replacements, yes, but if precise 3D armrest adjustment at a much lower price is your priority, the Marsail or HUANUO deliver comparable ergonomic fundamentals for significantly less." },
  { "q": "How important is a multi-year warranty for an office chair in this price range?", "a": "Given that gas lifts, casters, and mesh materials all wear gradually over years of daily use, a documented multi-year warranty like the CAPOT's 5-year coverage provides real protection beyond the standard 30 to 90-day return window most competitors offer." },
  { "q": "Does the FelixKing chair's lack of a stated weight capacity mean it's less durable?", "a": "Not necessarily, since it does specify other durability features like an explosion-proof base plate and a three-stage air rod, but the absence of a specific weight capacity figure does make it harder to directly compare its load-bearing performance against the other picks in this comparison." },
  { "q": "Can I get similar lumbar precision to the CAPOT's 8-level system from a cheaper chair?", "a": "The Marsail and HUANUO picks both offer a continuous 1.18 to 2.16 inch adjustment range that provides comparable functional precision, even without the CAPOT's specifically stepped 8-level system, at a significantly lower price." }
