    q: "What is the best wireless headphone under $50 with ANC?",
    a: "The TOZO HT2 at about $40 with hybrid feedforward and feedback ANC, 60h battery, and wireless charging case. It delivers the strongest ANC of any over-ear headphone under $50. For ANC in earbuds, the Soundcore P40i at $45 to $50 adds adaptive ANC with 6 mics.",

    q: "Are wired headphones worth buying in 2024 when wireless is everywhere?",
    a: "Yes, for desk use. The ATH-M20x at $49 delivers professional studio audio that no wireless headphone under $100 matches on sound accuracy. There is no battery to manage, no Bluetooth to pair, and no latency. For commuting and movement, wireless is better. For a fixed desk setup, wired is still the best choice for audio quality per dollar.",

    q: "Do I need ANC in headphones under $50?",
    a: "If you study in a noisy dorm, library, or cafe, ANC noticeably reduces ambient noise and makes focus easier. The TOZO HT2 and Soundcore P40i both deliver meaningful ANC at this price. If you use headphones at a quiet home desk or primarily for gym workouts, ANC is a nice feature rather than essential.",
