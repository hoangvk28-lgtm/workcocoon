export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Sheet Feeding Changes the Actual Scanning Workflow, Not Just the Speed",
    "explanation": "A sheet-fed scanner like the HP HPPS100 pulls a page through mechanically once you insert it, so you don't need to hold the device steady or reposition anything mid-scan, unlike a flatbed where you lift a lid and place a page or a wand where you drag by hand. This matters most if you're scanning several separate pages in one sitting, since a mechanical feed removes the repetitive manual step each page would otherwise require. Check whether a listing says \"auto document feed\" or \"sheet-fed\" versus \"flatbed\" or \"handheld,\" since these terms describe fundamentally different physical processes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Simplex Versus Duplex Scanning Determines Whether Two-Sided Documents Need a Second Pass",
    "explanation": "Simplex scanning captures only one side of a page per pass, meaning a two-sided document requires manually flipping the page and scanning again, while duplex scanning captures both sides in a single feed. None of the picks in this specific price tier support duplex scanning, so if you frequently scan two-sided documents, budget for a second manual pass or look to a higher price tier for genuine duplex support. Check the listing specifically for the word \"duplex\" or \"two-sided,\" since \"double-sided\" claims sometimes just mean the scanner can physically accept either orientation, not that it captures both sides at once."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DPI Resolution Determines Whether Fine Print Stays Legible After Scanning",
    "explanation": "A 300 DPI scan is adequate for a quick reference copy but can blur small text if you zoom in later, while a 900 or 1200 DPI setting captures far more detail at the cost of a larger file size. The HP pick's stated 1200 DPI maximum is the highest resolution figure in this comparison, worth prioritizing if you'll be reading fine print off the scanned file rather than just archiving it. Check for the specific DPI number stated in the listing rather than trusting a vague \"high resolution\" claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Wand Scanner's Battery Dependency Is a Real Ongoing Cost, Not a One-Time Purchase Decision",
    "explanation": "The Hczrc and AOZBZ handheld scanners both run on 2 AA batteries that aren't included in the box, meaning you're responsible for keeping spares on hand indefinitely rather than paying once for a rechargeable built-in battery. This keeps the unit cheap and the batteries are universally available, but it's a genuine ongoing cost and inconvenience worth weighing against a USB-powered option like the flatbed pick in this comparison, which never needs batteries at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included Software Can Add Real Functionality Beyond Raw Scanning",
    "explanation": "The HP HPPS100 includes free WorkScan software with auto-crop, size detection, and background cleanup, features that meaningfully improve the usability of the raw scan without extra editing steps elsewhere. The handheld wand scanners in this comparison, by contrast, require no software but also offer none of these automatic cleanup features, saving the file exactly as captured. Check whether a listing bundles software and what that software actually does, rather than assuming all scanners in a price range offer comparable post-scan processing."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the HP HPPS100 scan both sides of a page automatically?", "a": "No, it's a simplex, one-sided scanner, so you'll need to manually flip the page and run it through a second time to capture both sides." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between a wand and a sheet-fed scanner at this price?", "a": "Assuming a handheld wand will be as fast as automatic sheet feeding, when in reality a wand requires a steady manual pass per page and is meaningfully slower for scanning multiple documents in one sitting." },
  { "q": "Is the HP HPPS100 worth the price jump over the Canon Canoscan Lide 300 flatbed?", "a": "If you regularly scan multi-page stacks and want automatic feeding, yes, but if you mostly scan single pages or photos occasionally, the Canon flatbed's lower price and evenly lit scan quality make more sense." },
  { "q": "How do I get the best results from a handheld wand scanner like the Hczrc or AOZBZ?", "a": "Drag the wand across the page at a slow, steady, even pace in one continuous motion, since inconsistent speed is the most common cause of warped or streaky scans." },
  { "q": "Do I need to buy anything extra to use the Hczrc or AOZBZ scanners out of the box?", "a": "Yes, both require 2 AA batteries that aren't included, though both do ship with a micro SD card for storage already included." },
  { "q": "Can I use the AOZBZ wand scanner to digitize an open book without damaging the spine?", "a": "Yes, since you drag the wand by hand across the open page rather than feeding it through rollers, it avoids the strain a sheet-fed or flatbed scanner could put on a book's binding." }
