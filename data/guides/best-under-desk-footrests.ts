The memory foam top layer provides cushioning underfoot while the non-slip bottom keeps it in place on hard floors. It is the most affordable pick in this roundup and the one with the largest buyer feedback base confirming consistent performance. The dual-mode design means users can switch between static support and active rocking without buying two separate products. Dual-mode stationary and rocker. That's a real strength, but weigh it against the flip side: memory foam compresses over extended use.",

The high-density foam maintains its shape across multiple height settings and the removable cover is machine washable. It is the height-adjustable mid-range pick. Users who cannot find a fixed-height footrest at the correct lift for their setup benefit from the adjustability more than users who always work at the same desk and chair combination.

Users who want to incorporate foot massage into their desk routine without buying a separate foot massager find the HUANUO a practical two-in-one option. Massage rollers for foot circulation.

  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best under-desk footrests (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best under-desk footrests (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best under-desk footrests (2026) over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best under-desk footrests (2026) you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best under-desk footrests (2026) that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Do under-desk footrests actually help with posture?", a: "Yes, when feet dangle without reaching the floor the thigh pressure on the seat edge reduces circulation and increases lower back tension. A footrest restores the natural foot-to-floor contact angle without requiring desk or chair height changes, which directly reduces the fatigue from dangling feet." },
  { q: "What height footrest do I need?", a: "The correct height depends on your chair and desk combination. With your chair at the proper height for your desk, measure the gap between your feet and the floor. That measurement is your target footrest height. Most standard under-desk footrests provide 2 to 4 inches of lift, which covers most common desk and chair combinations." },
  { q: "Are rocking footrests better than flat ones?", a: "Rocking footrests actively engage calf muscles and improve circulation, which is beneficial for users who sit for long consecutive hours. Flat stationary footrests provide consistent elevation and are quieter. For users who find active foot movement distracting, a flat footrest is the better choice." },
  { q: "Can I use a footrest at a standing desk?", a: "Yes. At a sitting height, a footrest works normally. The ErgoFoam XL is specifically designed for users whose standing desk is set to a taller sitting height or who use a bar stool at a standing desk. For standard floor-level sitting, the standard height footrests are sufficient." },
  { q: "How long do foam footrests last?", a: "High-density foam footrests (ErgoFoam) maintain their shape for 2 to 3 years of daily use. Standard memory foam compresses faster, typically within 1 to 2 years. Wood rockers (StrongTek) last indefinitely as wood does not compress. Removable and washable covers extend the usable life of foam footrests by keeping the cover in good condition." }
