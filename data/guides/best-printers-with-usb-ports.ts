    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer with usb port holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    a: "Usually not. USB host printing from a flash drive typically only supports JPEG images and PDF documents, since the printer renders the file internally without a computer's help. Convert Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files to PDF first if you need to print them directly from a stick.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why won't my printer read my flash drive?",
    a: "Most printers with a USB host port only recognize FAT32-formatted drives, not the exFAT format common on newer, larger-capacity flash drives. Reformat the drive to FAT32, which caps individual files around 4GB, or try a smaller, older drive.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I connect one USB printer to multiple computers?",
    a: "A standard USB-B wired connection only serves one computer at a time. For occasional use, manually unplugging and replugging the cable works, but for regular multi-computer sharing without wireless, a small USB switch box lets 2 to 4 computers share the same printer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is USB printing faster than wireless printing?",
    a: "A direct USB-B connection to a computer is typically at least as fast as wireless, since it avoids network overhead. USB host printing directly from a flash drive is actually the slowest option, since the printer has to decode and render the file internally without a computer's driver doing that work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who actually needs USB host printing from a flash drive?",
    a: "Real use cases include event photographers doing kiosk-style printing without a laptop, small businesses printing signage or documents on-site, and emergency printing when the usual computer is unavailable. If none of these apply, a standard USB-B wired connection or wireless printing will cover typical home and office needs.",
