  "Under $150, USB-C monitors cluster around a 23.8 to 24 inch 1080P IPS panel, but they differ in real ways that matter daily: refresh rate, how much power the USB-C port actually delivers to your laptop, and whether that single cable can fully charge a laptop or just pass through a trickle.",
  "We compared this lineup on stated refresh rate, power delivery wattage, and eye-care certifications, since a USB-C monitor's whole appeal is replacing a tangle of cables with one, and that only works if the power delivery spec actually matches your laptop's charging needs."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A USB-C Port on a Monitor Doesn't Always Mean It Charges Your Laptop",
    "explanation": "USB-C is a physical connector shape, not a guarantee of any specific capability, so a monitor can have a USB-C port that only carries video and data without providing any power back to your laptop. Some listings explicitly state passthrough charging through the monitor's own power adapter, like the ViewSonic VA2448-MHU in this comparison, while others only describe USB-C for video and data transfer without mentioning charging at all. Read the specific wording in the listing's connectivity section, and don't assume charging capability just because the port is labeled USB-C."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Refresh Rate Above 60Hz Helps Even Outside of Gaming",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate describes how many times per second the screen redraws its image, measured in Hz, and while gamers chase higher numbers for competitive advantage, a 120Hz or 144Hz panel also makes everyday scrolling, cursor movement, and window dragging feel noticeably smoother than a standard 60Hz monitor, even for basic office work. If you've never used a monitor above 60Hz, the difference is more noticeable in person than it sounds on a spec sheet, so it's worth prioritizing even if you don't game."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Variable Refresh Rate Only Matters if Your Use Case Produces Variable Frame Rates",
    "explanation": "Variable Refresh Rate technology synchronizes the monitor's refresh rate with the frame rate coming from your graphics card, preventing visual tearing and stuttering specifically when frame rates fluctuate, like during gaming. For general productivity work, browsing, or video playback where frame rates are typically stable, this feature provides little practical benefit, so don't pay extra for it if gaming isn't part of your regular use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Third-Party Eye-Care Certifications Are More Meaningful Than Generic Marketing Terms",
    "explanation": "Terms like \"flicker-free\" and \"low blue light\" appear on nearly every monitor listing regardless of whether they've been independently verified, but a specific named certification, like TUV Rheinland, means the claim has been tested and confirmed by an outside organization rather than just stated by the manufacturer. When comparing two monitors with similar eye-care marketing language, the one citing a specific named certification is generally the more trustworthy claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check Input Variety if You Plan to Connect More Than One Device",
    "explanation": "A monitor with only USB-C and one other input limits your flexibility if you want to switch between a laptop, a gaming console, and an older desktop that doesn't have USB-C, while a monitor offering HDMI, DisplayPort, and legacy VGA alongside USB-C, like the ViewSonic VA2448-MHU in this comparison, covers a wider range of devices. Count how many separate devices you'll realistically want to connect before assuming a single USB-C port is enough."
  }

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will any USB-C monitor charge my laptop through the same cable used for video?", "a": "Not necessarily. Some monitors, like the ViewSonic VA2448-MHU in this comparison, explicitly state passthrough charging through their own power adapter, while others only use USB-C for video and data without confirmed charging. Always check the specific listing language rather than assuming every USB-C port charges your device." },
  { "q": "Is 144Hz actually noticeable for regular office work, not just gaming?", "a": "Yes, most users notice smoother cursor movement, scrolling, and window transitions moving from a standard 60Hz monitor to 120Hz or 144Hz, even without gaming. It's a genuine everyday quality-of-life improvement, not just a gaming-specific spec." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between the msi PRO MP242 and the BenQ GW2490C, since both are 144Hz?", "a": "Both hit the same 144Hz refresh rate, but msi bundles a built-in Eye-Q Check vision assessment tool while BenQ frames its version specifically around corporate and IT bulk deployment reliability. The practical display experience is very similar between them." },
  { "q": "How do I know if a monitor's USB-C port will work with my specific laptop?", "a": "Check that your laptop's USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode or Thunderbolt, since a basic charging-only USB-C port on your laptop won't carry video output to the monitor regardless of how capable the monitor's own USB-C port is. This compatibility requirement sits on the laptop side, not the monitor side." },
  { "q": "Does Variable Refresh Rate work with any graphics card, or just specific brands?", "a": "Variable Refresh Rate implementations like FreeSync generally work across a range of graphics cards including many NVIDIA GPUs through compatibility modes, though official certification and full feature support varies. Check your specific graphics card's compatibility list if VRR is a priority for you." },
  { "q": "Can I use a VGA-only older desktop with these USB-C monitors?", "a": "Only if the specific monitor includes a VGA input alongside USB-C, since not every model in this price range does. The ViewSonic VA2448-MHU in this comparison specifically includes VGA for this kind of legacy compatibility, while some other picks here only include USB-C, HDMI, and DisplayPort." }
