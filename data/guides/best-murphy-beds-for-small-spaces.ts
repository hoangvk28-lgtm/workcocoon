  "Fitting a murphy bed into a small room comes down to two measurements almost no listing states clearly: your ceiling height and your room depth once the bed is lowered. A vertical queen murphy bed needs a taller ceiling than most people expect, and even when it technically fits, the floor space it occupies when open can conflict with a door swing or block a heating vent you forgot to check.",
  "This guide focuses on the small-space decision that matters most, vertical versus horizontal orientation and the room clearance each actually requires, rather than repeating desk-integration details covered elsewhere. Below are 8 picks we evaluated based on product specs and buyer feedback, ranging from a $197.00 DIY hardware kit to a $699.98 assembled cabinet bed, with honest notes on which ones are bare mechanisms versus finished furniture.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify the desk surface is real and usable, not just marketing alongside a plain murphy bed",
    "explanation": "Some products marketed alongside desk-focused search terms are actually plain murphy beds with no integrated desk surface at all, just a folding cabinet bed that happens to show up in these results, while others genuinely build a fold-down or fixed desk into the cabinet face.\n\nThis distinction matters directly if desk integration is the actual reason you're buying, discovering after purchase that a \"murphy bed with desk\" has no real desk surface is a common and entirely avoidable disappointment.\n\nCheck the listing photos and description specifically for a described, dimensioned desk surface, not just the presence of desk-related keywords in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the desk surface's weight limit for items left sitting when the bed folds down",
    "explanation": "A fold-down desk built into a murphy bed cabinet has a real weight limit on what can safely sit on it when the bed mechanism operates, and unlike a standalone desk, that weight isn't just about the desk holding items, it's about whether those items interfere with or get damaged by the folding motion itself.\n\nThis matters directly for anyone planning to leave a monitor, laptop, or other equipment on the desk regularly, some cabinet beds require clearing the desk completely before folding, while others accommodate lighter items left in place.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for the desk's stated weight capacity and whether it requires being cleared before folding, not just the bed's own mattress weight rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plan outlet and monitor arm placement before installation, not after",
    "explanation": "A murphy bed with desk changes position between folded-up and folded-down states, meaning any outlet you'll use for a monitor, lamp, or charger needs to remain accessible in both positions, and a monitor arm clamped to the desk edge needs clearance to move with the mechanism without hitting the wall or cabinet frame.\n\nThis matters because retrofitting outlet access or monitor arm clearance after installation is far more difficult than planning it beforehand, especially if the unit is wall-mounted.\n\nCheck the listing for outlet cutout or pass-through details, and measure your intended monitor arm's clearance needs against the cabinet's fold range before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match room ceiling height and wall space to your specific model's clearance requirements",
    "explanation": "Murphy bed cabinets require specific minimum ceiling height and wall clearance to operate the folding mechanism safely, and these requirements vary between models and mattress sizes, a queen-size unit needs meaningfully more clearance than a twin, and horizontal-mounted units have different wall-width requirements than vertical ones.\n\nThis matters because a unit that doesn't fit your room's actual ceiling height or wall dimensions simply can't be installed safely regardless of how good the desk integration looks in photos.\n\nCheck the listing's specific minimum ceiling height and wall clearance requirements against your room's actual measured dimensions before ordering, not just the general size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider professional installation versus DIY assembly for a mechanism you'll operate daily",
    "explanation": "A murphy bed's folding mechanism sees repeated daily stress if used as a genuine daily-fold desk-bed combo, and installation quality directly affects long-term safety and smooth operation, a mechanism installed slightly out of alignment can bind, sag, or wear unevenly over time.\n\nThis matters more for a unit that folds daily as part of an active desk-bed routine, less for one that stays in one position most of the time.\n\nCheck whether the listing includes or recommends professional installation, and factor that cost and time into your total decision if you're not confident assembling a wall-mounted mechanical system yourself."

    q: "Can a murphy bed be anchored to drywall alone?",
    a: "No. Every murphy bed mechanism in this list must anchor into wall studs spanning at least two studs at 16 inches on center. Drywall alone cannot support the load, and masonry or metal stud walls need different, specialized anchoring hardware.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my door swings into the space where the bed lowers?",
    a: "An open murphy bed occupies the same floor space an inward-swinging door needs to travel through. If your door swings toward the bed wall, plan to rehang it outward before installation, since this is a common conflict buyers discover only after the cabinet is mounted.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a murphy bed block a heating or cooling vent?",
    a: "If a floor or wall vent sits behind or beside where the cabinet will be installed, it will likely be blocked once the bed is mounted. Check the installation footprint for vents and plan to reroute ductwork before installation, not after.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose a DIY hardware kit or an assembled cabinet for a small room?",
    a: "A DIY kit like the Create-A-Bed Queen Deluxe or Queen Murphy Hardware Kit lets you build a cabinet sized exactly to your room's ceiling and depth constraints, useful if your space is right at the edge of standard requirements. An assembled cabinet like the AMERLIFE or Yoobure comes in fixed dimensions, simpler to install but less flexible for an unusual room.",
