export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Outlet Spacing Matters as Much as Outlet Count When Using Bulky Chargers",
    "explanation": "The YISHU pick specifically offers 1.8 inches of spacing between outlets, wider than the standard 1.5-inch spacing found on many competing strips, which directly determines whether a bulky wall-wart charger blocks the outlet next to it. A strip advertising 8 outlets isn't actually usable as 8 outlets if 3 or 4 of them get blocked by oversized plugs, so the real usable outlet count can be meaningfully lower than the advertised number. Check for stated outlet spacing dimensions, not just the total outlet count, before assuming a higher-outlet-count strip will actually accommodate all your devices simultaneously."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Joule Rating Reveals Real Differences in Surge Protection Even Among Similarly Priced Strips",
    "explanation": "The Yintar pick's 1680 joule rating is more than 8 times higher than the Amazon Basics 2-pack's 200 joule rating, despite both being priced within a few dollars of each other, meaning the Yintar strip can absorb a substantially larger electrical surge before its protection is exhausted. A higher joule rating specifically matters for protecting more expensive electronics like laptops or monitors that would be costly to replace if a power surge got through. Compare the specific joule number stated in each listing rather than assuming any strip labeled as a surge protector offers comparable protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C Ports With Higher Amperage Ratings Charge Modern Devices Meaningfully Faster",
    "explanation": "Several picks in this comparison offer USB-C ports rated at 3A output, faster than a standard USB-A port's typical 2.4A rating, which translates to genuinely quicker charging for phones and tablets that support higher-wattage charging standards. If you primarily charge older devices or ones that don't support fast charging, this difference matters less, but for modern phones capable of fast charging, a strip's USB-C amperage rating directly affects how long you wait for a full charge. Check the specific amperage rating listed for each USB port type rather than assuming all USB-C ports charge at the same speed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "ETL Certification Provides Independent Verification a Manufacturer's Own Safety Claims Don't",
    "explanation": "The YISHU pick specifically cites ETL certification, confirming independent third-party testing for overload, short-circuit, over-current, over-voltage, and overheating protection, a documented standard beyond the manufacturer simply stating the product includes these safety features. A strip without a named certification may still include genuine safety circuitry, but there's less independent verification backing that claim. Check specifically for a named certifying body like ETL or UL rather than accepting general safety language as equivalent to documented third-party testing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Pack's Value Depends Entirely on Whether You Actually Need Multiple Units",
    "explanation": "The Amazon Basics 2-pack works out to a lower per-unit cost than buying two single strips separately, but this value only materializes if you genuinely need two power strips, whether for two rooms or as a backup unit. Buying a 2-pack when you only need one strip means paying more upfront for a spare you may never use, even though the per-unit math looks favorable on paper. Confirm your actual strip-count need honestly before letting a lower per-unit price drive the purchase decision."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a high joule rating for a power strip used with basic electronics like lamps or fans?", "a": "For basic, inexpensive electronics, a lower joule rating like the Amazon Basics pick's 200J is generally sufficient, but for more expensive electronics like laptops or monitors, a higher rating like the Yintar pick's 1680J provides more meaningful protection." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing outlet counts across power strips?", "a": "Assuming a strip with more advertised outlets will actually fit more devices simultaneously, when tightly spaced outlets can cause bulky chargers to block adjacent outlets, effectively reducing the usable count below the advertised total." },
  { "q": "Is the Olcorife's compact design worth it over a strip with more outlets like the YISHU?", "a": "If minimizing physical footprint for travel or a cramped desk is your priority, yes, but if you need to power more devices simultaneously, the YISHU's 8 outlets and 4 USB ports offer more total capacity for a similar price." },
  { "q": "How do I know if a USB-C port will fast-charge my phone?", "a": "Check the stated amperage output for the USB-C port, since a 3A rating like several picks in this comparison offer will charge most modern phones noticeably faster than a standard 2.4A USB-A port." },
  { "q": "Does the Amazon Basics 2-pack's short 2-foot cord limit where I can place it?", "a": "Yes, a 2-foot cord requires the strip to sit very close to the wall outlet, so if you need to reach a desk or piece of furniture set back from the wall, a longer-corded pick like the Yintar or YISHU's 6-foot cords offer more placement flexibility." },
  { "q": "Can I mount any of these power strips to a wall if I don't want it sitting on a desk or floor?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison include mounting holes on the back specifically for wall installation, letting you keep the strip off the desk or floor entirely if preferred." }
