    description: "A raised base is the specific fix here for the wobble common on flat-base 3018-class machines, paired with an upgraded assembly process that reduces setup complexity versus the original 3018. GRBL control keeps it open-source and community-supported, with Candle handling movement and G-code.\n\nThe 300 x 180 x 45mm working area is modest but genuinely useful for signs, small parts, and PCB prototypes. An included offline controller runs basic functions and compatible G-code files without a connected computer, useful for a workshop that doesn't want a laptop tied up.",

  {
    "q": "How much smaller is the usable work area on mini desktop cnc machines versus the external footprint?",
    "a": "Meaningfully smaller in most cases, since clamps, tool stick-out, and frame hardware all eat into the nominal travel figures, so check documented usable travel rather than exterior dimensions alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are mini CNC machines noisier in a small room?",
    "a": "Sound can feel more concentrated in a small room even at the same decibel level, so consider extraction and placement specifically for the room size, not just the machine's rated noise level."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
