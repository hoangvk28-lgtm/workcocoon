export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What's the difference between desktop cnc mills and a CNC router for metal work?",
    "a": "Mills are generally built with more rigid frames, better spindle/toolholder systems, and tighter Z-axis control specifically for milling metal, while routers prioritize larger work area for wood and softer materials."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much does Z-axis clearance actually matter?",
    "a": "More than most buyers expect, since a vise or fixture takes up real Z-height, and a mill with a nominally tall Z-axis can still leave very little practical clearance once workholding is installed."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
