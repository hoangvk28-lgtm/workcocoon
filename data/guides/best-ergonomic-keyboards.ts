That range matters because a wave keyboard and a full split keyboard solve different problems and demand a different adjustment period, so the right pick depends on how much your wrists actually need to change position, not just on price.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what split, curved, and vertical layouts each actually change about your hand position",
    "explanation": "A curved keyboard bends the key rows into an arc that reduces how far your fingers reach across the board but keeps both hands in a fixed relative position, a split keyboard physically separates the two halves so each hand and wrist can angle independently to a more natural position, and a fully vertical keyboard rotates the hands toward a handshake-like orientation that reduces forearm rotation (pronation) more aggressively than either curved or split designs.\n\nThese are meaningfully different interventions, not just cosmetic variations on the same idea, and the amount of adjustment period and the specific relief they provide differs: a curved board requires almost no adaptation, a split board requires learning a new hand spacing, and a vertical board requires the most significant adaptation period but addresses forearm rotation most directly.\n\nIf a specific pain type (wrist deviation, forearm rotation, shoulder width) has been identified, match the layout type to that specific issue rather than assuming any keyboard labeled \"ergonomic\" addresses the same problem."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the key switch type, since it affects both typing feel and finger force required",
    "explanation": "Ergonomic keyboards commonly use one of three switch technologies: membrane (a soft rubber dome under each key, quiet and inexpensive but requiring the key to bottom out fully to register), scissor or low-profile (a shorter, more stable keystroke similar to a laptop keyboard), or mechanical (an individual physical switch per key with more configurable actuation force and travel distance, generally louder but often preferred for tactile feedback and reduced bottoming-out force).\n\nThis matters for anyone with existing wrist or finger strain specifically because mechanical switches can be selected for lighter actuation force, requiring less pressure to register a keystroke than a standard membrane keyboard, a genuine factor in repetitive strain rather than just a preference for typing feel.\n\nIf finger fatigue or strain is a specific concern, check for stated actuation force (measured in grams) rather than assuming all keyboards require the same finger pressure to type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm wireless connection type matches your actual devices, and know the battery tradeoffs",
    "explanation": "Wireless ergonomic keyboards connect via Bluetooth (works with virtually any modern device without a dongle, but can have more noticeable input latency and reconnection delay), a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver (generally lower latency and more reliable than Bluetooth, but requires a free USB port and the receiver can be lost), or wired USB (zero latency and no battery to manage, but no cable-free movement).\n\nMulti-device Bluetooth models that support pairing with several devices and switching between them are a genuine convenience for anyone alternating between a work laptop and a personal computer, but this feature isn't universal even among Bluetooth keyboards.\n\nCheck the specific connection type and, for wireless models, confirm multi-device pairing support explicitly if you need to switch between more than one computer regularly, and factor in that backlit wireless models draw more power and need more frequent charging than non-backlit equivalents."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for a negative tilt option and separate wrist rest, since flat isn't always neutral",
    "explanation": "A truly neutral wrist position during typing involves the hands tilting slightly downward from the wrist toward the keys (negative tilt), which is the opposite of the upward tilt most standard and even many \"ergonomic\" keyboards default to with their built-in feet, and only some ergonomic models offer an actual negative-tilt adjustment or come with a design that achieves this angle by default.\n\nA separate, adequately sized wrist rest matters independently of the keyboard's own tilt, since resting the wrist (not just the palm) on a support surface during typing reduces the upward bend at the wrist that a raised keyboard back otherwise creates.\n\nCheck specifically for a stated negative tilt option or a naturally downward-sloping design, and confirm whether a wrist rest is included versus needing to be purchased separately, rather than assuming any \"ergonomic\" label includes proper tilt geometry."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since some ergonomic keyboards share variants with different genuine track records",
    "explanation": "Ergonomic keyboards, especially from smaller brands, are frequently sold in multiple color or configuration variants that share the same underlying design and sometimes the same pooled review history despite being technically separate listings, which can make one specific variant's review count look artificially large or, conversely, leave a genuinely new design with almost no independent track record despite looking similar to an established model.\n\nA keyboard central to your daily work deserves a design with genuinely substantial, focused review history behind it, not just a plausible-looking rating built on a thin or shared sample.\n\nWhen comparing keyboards, especially similarly-designed variants from the same brand, check both the star rating and the review count together, and read a handful of reviews to confirm they describe the exact variant you're considering."

    q: "How long does it take to adjust to an ergonomic keyboard?",
    a: "Expect typing speed to drop 20-40% for the first 2-4 weeks, especially on a true split layout like the Ergo K860 or Arteck. A one-piece wave keyboard like the Wave Keys is a gentler adjustment. Give yourself several weeks of regular use before judging comfort or speed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a wave keyboard and a true split keyboard?",
    a: "A wave keyboard is one fixed unit that curves the keys apart without separating, offering an easier transition but less forearm relief. A true split keyboard lets the two halves move independently or tent outward, giving more real ergonomic benefit at the cost of a longer adjustment period and larger footprint.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an ergonomic keyboard if I only type a few hours a day?",
    a: "Ergonomic keyboards help most with cumulative strain, so the benefit scales with how many hours you type daily. Light, occasional use may not need a full split layout, a wave-style board like the Wave Keys is a reasonable middle ground for moderate daily use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will an ergonomic keyboard fix wrist pain on its own?",

  },
  {
    q: "What is tenting and do I need it?",
    a: "Tenting means tilting the two keyboard halves outward so your palms face more toward each other, reducing forearm twist. Only hinged true split boards like the Arteck in this list support adjustable tenting; if that's a priority, skip the fixed wave options.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a wired or wireless ergonomic keyboard better?",
    a: "A wired board like the Perixx PERIBOARD-512B removes battery and pairing concerns entirely, which suits a desk that never moves. A wireless board like the Ergo K860 adds multi-device pairing flexibility if you switch between a laptop and desktop.",
