    whyItWins: "The WH-CH520 hits the right combination for most students: lightweight on-ear design (lighter than most wireless headphones), 50-hour battery (charge once a week, not once a day), and a built-in microphone that handles Zoom participation adequately. The USB-C quick charge gives you 90 minutes of battery from a 3-minute charge -- the 'I forgot to charge it' emergency fix.",
    bodyParagraph: "For listening to lectures, the sound is clear and well-balanced without the exaggerated bass of many budget wireless headphones. Professors' voices cut through clearly without manual EQ adjustments. At 147g, significantly lighter than over-ear alternatives -- for 2--3 hour classes, on-ear pressure is less fatiguing.",

  {
    question: "What are the best headphones for online classes?",
    answer: "For most students, the Sony WH-CH520 covers the right balance: wireless, 50-hour battery, lightweight, adequate built-in mic. For classes with heavy participation, the Logitech H390 provides better mic clarity via its boom microphone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need noise-canceling headphones for online classes?",
    answer: "Only if you study or attend class in a consistently noisy environment. ANC helps with constant background noise (dorm HVAC, street traffic). For a quiet room, standard headphones are sufficient. ANC handles HVAC and hallway hum well, but will not silence a nearby roommate having a full conversation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which is better for online classes -- wired or wireless?",
    answer: "Both work. Wired (Logitech H390) is more reliable -- no battery risk, no Bluetooth latency. Wireless (Sony WH-CH520, JLab picks) is more flexible. If battery anxiety is a concern, go wired. If you prefer freedom of movement, go wireless and charge nightly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use gaming headsets for online classes?",
    answer: "Yes, gaming headsets work for classes. Most have boom mics (good for calls) and decent audio. They tend to be heavier and bulkier than the picks in this guide, and the aggressive styling may be visually prominent on video calls. The Logitech H390 covers the mic quality benefit of gaming headsets without the gaming aesthetic.",
  },
  {
    question: "What headphones work best for Zoom classes?",
    answer: "Any headphone with a built-in mic works on Zoom. Use Zoom's 'Suppress background noise' setting (medium or high) in Audio settings to improve built-in mic performance. The Logitech H390 is the most reliable choice for consistent Zoom call quality.",
