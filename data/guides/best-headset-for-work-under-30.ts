export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Check the boom mic mechanism, not just whether a mic is included",
    explanation: "Every headset in this comparison includes a microphone, but how that mic attaches and moves varies meaningfully: some use a fixed boom arm that adjusts to a set position and stays there, while others use a rotating design that can be tucked completely out of the way when you're not on a call. This matters for daily comfort and convenience if you regularly switch between work calls and simply listening to music or watching videos throughout the day, since a tuck-away mic doesn't stay visibly extended during non-call use. Check the listing specifically for \"rotating\" or \"tuck-away\" language versus a simple \"adjustable boom\" description if this convenience matters to you."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Confirm your computer's actual port type before assuming any headset connects",
    explanation: "Wired headsets in this price range connect via USB-A, USB-C, or a 3.5mm analog jack, and not every headset supports every connection type, meaning a USB-A-only headset simply won't plug into a newer laptop that has dropped USB-A ports entirely in favor of USB-C only. Check your specific computer's available ports (or which ports you have free, since docking stations can add ports back) and match that against the headset's stated connection type before assuming any wired headset connects to any computer directly."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Look for a stated driver size to compare audio quality objectively",
    explanation: "Audio driver size, commonly stated in millimeters like 40mm in this category, gives you a comparable spec for potential audio quality, though it's not the only factor that determines how a headset actually sounds. A listing that states a specific driver size at least provides something concrete to compare against a competitor, while a listing relying only on vague \"crystal clear audio\" language gives you nothing checkable. When two headsets are priced similarly, prioritize the one stating a specific driver size over one using only subjective marketing language."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weigh over-ear versus on-ear design for your specific comfort preference and session length",
    explanation: "Over-ear headsets fully enclose your ear within the cushion, generally providing better noise isolation from surrounding office sound, while on-ear designs rest directly on your ear rather than around it, which some users find lighter and cooler for extended wear but with less isolation from ambient noise. Neither design is universally better, and the right choice depends on your specific office environment (open floor plan with more noise versus a quiet private office) and personal comfort preference during multi-hour sessions. If you haven't tried both styles before, over-ear is generally the safer default for a busy office environment."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check ear cushion material if you'll wear the headset for multiple hours daily",
    explanation: "Ear cushion material affects both comfort and heat buildup during extended wear, and several listings in this category specifically name protein-memory foam cushions, a material chosen for its combination of softness and breathability compared to basic foam padding. If your workday involves multiple hours of calls or audio use daily, this detail matters more than it would for occasional, short-session use, since cheaper or less breathable cushion material can become genuinely uncomfortable or cause ear heat buildup over a full workday. Check the listing specifically for cushion material language rather than assuming all ear padding at this price feels the same."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Will a USB-A headset work with a laptop that only has USB-C ports?",
    a: "Not directly, you'd need a USB-C to USB-A adapter, or you could choose a headset that natively supports USB-C like the AOC pick in this comparison. Check your specific laptop's available ports before assuming any USB-A headset connects without an adapter."
  },
  {
    q: "Does a tuck-away rotating mic actually improve call quality?",
    a: "Not directly; the rotating mechanism is primarily a convenience feature for stowing the mic when not on a call, rather than a call-quality improvement. Call clarity depends more on the mic's noise-cancelling design and its distance from your mouth when actively positioned for a call."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 40mm driver size good for a work headset?",
    a: "40mm is a common driver size in this price range and generally delivers solid audio quality for calls, music, and video meetings. It's a useful comparable spec, though actual sound quality also depends on tuning and build quality beyond the driver size alone."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use these headsets for gaming as well as work calls?",
    a: "Yes, most wired headsets in this price range work fine for both work calls and casual gaming, since they connect the same way and use similar drivers. If gaming is a significant use case, you might also consider dedicated gaming headsets with additional features like virtual surround sound."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I clean the ear cushions on a wired headset?",
    a: "Most protein-memory foam or standard foam ear cushions can be wiped down with a slightly damp cloth; avoid fully soaking them in water. Check your specific headset's manual or listing for manufacturer-recommended cleaning instructions if included."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do some headsets support both USB and 3.5mm connections?",
    a: "Dual connectivity gives flexibility across different devices, some computers or older equipment may only have a 3.5mm jack rather than a free USB port. A headset supporting both connection types works across more devices without needing an adapter."
