    "explanation": "Listings for a airprint printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the airprint printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this airprint printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any airprint printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A airprint printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "Does every printer in this guide actually support AirPrint?",
    a: "Only the Canon TS5320's Amazon listing states AirPrint explicitly. The other 7 picks are current-generation wireless AIOs from HP, Canon, and Epson, brands whose recent wireless lineups broadly support AirPrint, but the listings themselves don't name it. Check Settings, Printers & Scanners on your iPhone before buying if AirPrint confirmation matters to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why doesn't my printer show up in my iPhone's AirPrint list?",
    a: "The most common cause is a network mismatch, the printer and iPhone need to be on the exact same wifi network and subnet, which trips up anyone using a separate guest network for the printer. Restarting both the printer and your router, then re-adding the printer from Settings, resolves most cases.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between AirPrint and a manufacturer's own app like HP Smart or Canon PRINT?",
    a: "AirPrint requires no app install or account and works directly from the iOS share sheet, but it offers fewer print options, no quality tiers, no tray selection, no borderless settings. The manufacturer's own app trades that simplicity for more control and features like ink level checks, at the cost of needing an install and sometimes an account.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use AirPrint on a guest wifi network?",
    a: "Generally no. AirPrint requires the printer and your iPhone to be on the same network and subnet, and guest networks are intentionally isolated from other devices for security, which blocks AirPrint's discovery process. Move the printer to your main household network if you're relying on AirPrint.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does my iPhone need a specific iOS version for AirPrint to work?",
    a: "Basic AirPrint printing works on any reasonably current iOS version, but some newer features like scan-to-phone or detailed print job status can require a more recent iOS release depending on the printer. Check your device's iOS version against the printer's stated compatibility if you want the full feature set.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an ink-tank printer like the Epson EcoTank ET-2800 a good AirPrint pick?",
    a: "Yes, if you print often enough from your iPhone that cartridge costs would add up. Ink-tank refills take 5 to 10 minutes versus a 2-3 minute cartridge swap, but happen far less often, which usually pays off for frequent printers over time.",
