      "The VASAGLE CUSTOS Snow White is the pick for most buyers. The largest review base on this list by a significant margin gives the 4.0-star rating real statistical weight. At $62.99, it undercuts most competitors in this category while delivering a clean, neutral finish that works with white desks, light wood furniture, and minimalist home office setups. The two-drawer design handles everyday paperwork efficiently. Steel frame rails inside drawers provide smooth glide action. Open-frame metal legs in matte black add a modern two-tone detail that keeps the piece from looking like a purely utilitarian filing cabinet.",

Over 3,200 reviews at 4.0 stars confirms consistent quality across a large buyer sample.

It is the most visually distinctive pick on this list and works well in boho, coastal, or eclectic home offices. Key consideration: verify the current review count before ordering - a lower review count means less statistical confidence in the rating compared to picks with 1,000-plus reviews.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are 2-drawer wood file cabinets good for small offices?",
    a: "Yes. A 2-drawer vertical cabinet sits at desk height or just below, so the top surface can serve double duty as a printer stand or side surface. Most 2-drawer vertical cabinets are 14 to 16 inches wide and 18 to 20 inches deep - compact enough for corners, under-desk spaces, and beside bookcases in smaller rooms.",

    a: "A vertical 2-drawer cabinet is taller and narrower, with drawers that pull straight out toward you. A lateral 2-drawer cabinet is wider and lower, with drawers that pull out from the side. Vertical cabinets use less floor space but stand taller; lateral cabinets have more of a furniture or credenza appearance and suit wider spaces. The VINGLI Rattan Oak (Pick 5) is the lateral option on this list.",
