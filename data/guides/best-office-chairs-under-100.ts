export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Certified Gas Lift Is a Genuine Safety Signal a Generic 'Sturdy Base' Claim Isn't",
    "explanation": "A gas lift is the pneumatic cylinder mechanism that raises and lowers a chair's height, and a BIFMA or SGS certification means that specific component has passed independent third-party safety testing for gradual, controlled height adjustment rather than relying only on the manufacturer's own quality claims. The DUMOS and NEO CHAIR picks in this comparison both specify a named certification, while a listing describing its base only as sturdy or durable without naming a specific certifying body gives you less verified assurance. Check a listing specifically for the words BIFMA or SGS attached to the gas lift or base component, not just a general durability claim elsewhere in the description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight Capacity Figures at This Price Tier Vary by 80 Pounds or More, a Genuinely Meaningful Range",
    "explanation": "The picks in this comparison range from a 250 lb capacity on the budget DUMOS chair up to 330 lbs on the top pick, a difference that matters directly if your body weight is anywhere near the lower end of that range, since a chair operating near its rated maximum tends to wear out its gas lift and frame faster than one with headroom to spare. Buying a chair rated close to or below your actual weight risks both discomfort and a shorter usable lifespan for the chair's mechanical components. Check the specific stated capacity number and compare it against your own weight with a reasonable safety margin, not just whether the chair is generally described as heavy-duty."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Lockable Recline Behaves Very Differently From a Free-Tilting Backrest During Actual Use",
    "explanation": "The Sweetcrispy pick's recline locks at a chosen angle between 90 and 135 degrees using a push lever, letting you stay reclined for reading or a break without having to hold the position with your body weight, while the 330LBS capacity chair's recline tilts back but automatically returns upright, meaning you can't stay in a reclined position hands-free. This is a real functional difference, not just a spec footnote, and it matters specifically if you plan to use the recline function for actual rest breaks rather than just occasional posture shifts. Check whether a listing specifically states the recline locks in place versus simply describing a tilt range, since these are different mechanisms with different practical uses."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flip-Up Armrests Solve a Real Space Problem That Fixed Armrests Cannot",
    "explanation": "A chair with flip-up armrests, like the NEO CHAIR, Sweetcrispy, or 330LBS capacity picks, can slide completely under a desk when not actively being used, freeing up visible floor space in a small room, while a fixed-armrest chair like the DUMOS pick always occupies the same footprint regardless of desk clearance. This matters specifically in a small home office or dorm room where every inch of visible floor space affects how cluttered the room feels, even if the fixed-armrest chair itself is otherwise comparably comfortable. Weigh your actual room size and desk clearance honestly before assuming armrest style is a minor cosmetic detail rather than a genuine space consideration."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Adjustable Lumbar Support Range Should Be Checked in Both Height and Depth, Not Just Presence or Absence",
    "explanation": "Simply having lumbar support isn't the same as having lumbar support that moves to match your specific spine curve, and a chair that only offers a fixed lumbar bump built into the backrest shape provides less personalized support than one with a lumbar pad that adjusts up, down, forward, or backward independently. None of the picks in this specific budget comparison offer the multi-directional lumbar adjustment found on pricier ergonomic chairs, so if precise lumbar customization is your top priority, understand that a genuinely adjustable lumbar system typically appears at a higher price tier than this comparison covers. Check whether a listing describes lumbar support as adjustable with specific directions and measurements, or simply built into the backrest's fixed shape."
  }

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can a $100 office chair really support 330 lbs safely?", "a": "Yes, if the listing specifically states that capacity and describes a reinforced frame material like nylon, as the top pick in this comparison does, though it's worth noting this specific chair doesn't name an independent certification for its gas lift the way the DUMOS or NEO CHAIR picks do." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a budget office chair?", "a": "Assuming any chair advertised as heavy-duty or sturdy has been independently tested, when only a specifically named certification like BIFMA or SGS confirms that verification, rather than the manufacturer's own marketing language alone." },
  { "q": "Is the Sweetcrispy chair's footrest worth it over a chair without one?", "a": "If you plan to use the chair for actual breaks or short rest periods during the workday, yes, the lockable recline and retractable footrest genuinely support that use case, but if you only need a standard upright desk chair, that combination adds bulk you may not use." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the NEO CHAIR's flip-up armrests will actually fit under my desk?", "a": "Measure the clearance height under your desk when the armrests are flipped up and compare it against the chair's seat height plus the flipped armrest height, since desk clearance varies enough between setups that this isn't safe to assume without checking." },
  { "q": "Does the DUMOS chair's lower 250 lb weight capacity mean it's built with lower-quality materials overall?", "a": "Not necessarily, since it still carries a BIFMA-certified gas lift matching the safety standard of the pricier NEO CHAIR pick, but the lower capacity does reflect a lighter-duty frame construction appropriate for its lower price point." },
  { "q": "Can I lock the recline on the 330LBS capacity chair the way I can with the Sweetcrispy pick?", "a": "No, its listing specifically notes the backrest tilts back but returns upright automatically rather than locking at an intermediate angle, so if a lockable recline matters to you, the Sweetcrispy pick is the better choice in this comparison." }
