  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Can a docking station fully charge my gaming laptop while I play?",
    a: "No. Gaming laptop stock chargers commonly deliver 130-230W, while even the highest-rated dock in this list, the Anker Prime DL7400, tops out at 140W. Connected during a demanding session, the laptop will still draw down its battery. Use the dock for desk productivity charging and switch back to the original charger before extended gaming.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run an eGPU through a docking station?",
    a: "No, this is a common misunderstanding. An eGPU connects directly to one of the laptop's own Thunderbolt ports; it cannot be relayed through a dock. If your gaming laptop has two Thunderbolt ports, connect the eGPU to one and a dock like the Plugable Thunderbolt 4 to the other.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my headset or controller cut out mid-game when docked?",
    a: "A gaming laptop under heavy load generates significant PCIe traffic that competes with the USB bandwidth a dock shares with connected peripherals. Plugging game-critical devices like a headset or controller directly into the laptop's own USB-A ports, rather than through the dock, resolves most dropouts.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a Thunderbolt-rated dock improve gaming display performance?",
    a: "It depends on whether your gaming laptop supports GPU-switching for external displays. Laptops with this feature can route display output directly from the discrete GPU through the dock; older laptops without it route the same signal through integrated graphics, bottlenecking performance regardless of the dock's Thunderbolt rating.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use a dock at all if I mainly game on this laptop?",
    a: "A dock is genuinely useful for desk-based work sessions where cable convenience matters, but for the gaming session itself, a direct display connection, the original charger, and directly connected peripherals deliver better and more stable performance. Treat docking and gaming as two separate modes rather than one continuous setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which dock in this list has the best display output for a gaming laptop?",
    a: "The Razer USB4 Dock is the only pick in this list rated for 4K 120Hz dual-monitor output, which better matches a gaming laptop's higher refresh rate display panel than the 60Hz-capped triple-display docks from Anker, TobenONE, MOKiN, and Selore.",
