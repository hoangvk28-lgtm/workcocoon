  "A TV stand dresser combines a chest of drawers with a wide, low-profile top built to hold a television, which makes it a practical fit for bedrooms and studio apartments where floor space for two separate pieces simply doesn't exist. The best versions pair real drawer storage for clothing or linens with a sturdy top rated for common TV sizes, and many now add LED lighting and built-in charging outlets that a standalone dresser or stand won't offer.",
  "Choosing one over a separate TV stand and dresser makes the most sense when floor space is tight or a single piece needs to anchor a small room, but it's worth going in with realistic expectations about drawer depth and weight distribution, both of which we cover in the buying criteria below.",

      "The WLIVE 7 Drawer at pricing is the lowest-priced option in this roundup and still delivers seven fabric drawers on a sturdy steel frame with a water-resistant wood top. It fits TVs up to 45 inches and assembles in 15 to 20 minutes, which makes it a fast setup for a bedroom or guest room on a tight budget. The fabric drawer bins pull out smoothly and work well for folded clothing, though they trade some rigidity for weight. This is the starting point for anyone who wants a functional dresser and TV stand combo without spending close to six figures on furniture for a single small room. Fast 15-20 minute assembly.

The app control lets you sync lighting to music or set a schedule, which is a feature standalone dressers and basic TV stands don't offer.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand dresser often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand dresser holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand dresser over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand dresser you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand dresser that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Will a TV stand dresser hold as much clothing as a regular dresser?",
    a: "Not always. Many TV stand dressers use fabric drawer bins that run shallower than a standard bedroom dresser's 18 to 22 inch drawer depth, so they're better suited to folded shirts and smaller items than bulky sweaters or jeans. If clothing capacity matters as much as the TV stand function, check the listed drawer depth before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to anchor a TV stand dresser to the wall?",
    a: "Yes. Combining a TV, cables, and a full set of loaded drawers in one piece shifts weight distribution compared to a standard dresser or stand alone, which increases tip-over risk if the piece isn't secured. Use the included anti-tip hardware to anchor it to the wall studs, regardless of whether the TV itself is also wall-mounted.",
  },
  {
    q: "What TV size fits a 47 inch wide dresser TV stand?",
    a: "It depends on the model's stated TV size range rather than just the top's width, since TV base stands vary in footprint and weight. Models in this roundup range from fitting TVs up to 45 inches on the narrower 7-drawer options to 65-75 inches on the widest 12-drawer model, so always check the manufacturer's stated range rather than estimating from screen size alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the LED lights and charging stations worth the extra cost?",
    a: "They're a genuine convenience if you want to eliminate a separate power strip and lamp behind the TV, and several picks here add them for only $10 to $25 more than a basic model. If you don't need extra lighting or charging, a non-LED model saves money and skips the Bluetooth pairing setup step.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a dresser and TV stand combo better than buying both separately?",
    a: "It depends on available floor space. A combo saves floor space and cost compared to buying a separate dresser and TV stand, which matters most in small bedrooms or studio apartments. In a larger room where floor space isn't constrained, two separate pieces can offer deeper drawers and a more flexible TV mounting height.",
