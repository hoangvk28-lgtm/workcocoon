    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How do I calculate the right standing desk height for a short person?", a: "A rough formula is to divide your height in inches by 5.5 and add 1, which estimates the desk height that keeps your elbows near 90 degrees while typing standing. For example, a 5'2\" (62 in) user gets roughly 12.3 as the result of that formula, used as a starting point for the desk's typing surface height. Fine-tune from there based on how it feels." },
  { q: "Do all standing desks go low enough for shorter users?", a: "No. Many standard standing desks have a minimum height around 28 to 29 inches, which can still feel too high for users under about 5'2\". Desks with a 3-stage frame, or dedicated low-height models, reach lower minimum settings than typical 2-stage electric desks." },
  { q: "Why does my keyboard tray feel too low when my desk is set for my height?", a: "At a desk set near its lowest setting, around 22 inches, a keyboard tray mounted underneath can drop to 18 to 20 inches, below the roughly 23-inch height that's comfortable for typing. If you're using a desk set unusually low, consider skipping the tray and typing directly on the desktop instead." },
  { q: "Do I need a monitor arm if I'm short and my desk is set low?", a: "Likely yes. When the desk surface sits low to match a shorter user's ergonomic typing height, a monitor resting directly on the desktop can end up below eye level, forcing the neck to bend down. A monitor arm raises the screen independently of the desk height and avoids that strain." },
  { q: "Can I just use a desk converter instead of buying a new standing desk?", a: "Yes, if your existing desk is already at a comfortable seated height for you. A converter sits on top of your current desk and lifts a monitor or laptop for standing use, which avoids the problem of a full standing-desk frame not reaching low enough, since your existing desk sets the base height." },
