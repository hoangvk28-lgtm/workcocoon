  "Compact ergonomic keyboards face the same core tension as portable ones, shrinking the footprint sometimes means sacrificing the split or tenting features that provide real ergonomic benefit, worth verifying whether a specific compact model retains genuine split design or is simply a smaller one-piece board. It's also worth separating two different tradeoffs, the functional loss of a number pad or navigation cluster is a distinct issue from any ergonomic design compromise, you may lose specific functionality in addition to, not instead of, ergonomic tradeoffs.",
  "Arrow key cluster size and placement usability is worth checking too, distinct from whether a number pad exists at all, and Fn-layer remapped functions like Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down vary a lot in how usable they feel from one compact keyboard to the next.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what split, curved, and vertical layouts each actually change about your hand position",
    "explanation": "A curved keyboard bends the key rows into an arc that reduces how far your fingers reach across the board but keeps both hands in a fixed relative position, a split keyboard physically separates the two halves so each hand and wrist can angle independently to a more natural position, and a fully vertical keyboard rotates the hands toward a handshake-like orientation that reduces forearm rotation (pronation) more aggressively than either curved or split designs.\n\nThese are meaningfully different interventions, not just cosmetic variations on the same idea, and the amount of adjustment period and the specific relief they provide differs: a curved board requires almost no adaptation, a split board requires learning a new hand spacing, and a vertical board requires the most significant adaptation period but addresses forearm rotation most directly.\n\nIf a specific pain type (wrist deviation, forearm rotation, shoulder width) has been identified, match the layout type to that specific issue rather than assuming any keyboard labeled \"ergonomic\" addresses the same problem."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the key switch type, since it affects both typing feel and finger force required",
    "explanation": "Ergonomic keyboards commonly use one of three switch technologies: membrane (a soft rubber dome under each key, quiet and inexpensive but requiring the key to bottom out fully to register), scissor or low-profile (a shorter, more stable keystroke similar to a laptop keyboard), or mechanical (an individual physical switch per key with more configurable actuation force and travel distance, generally louder but often preferred for tactile feedback and reduced bottoming-out force).\n\nThis matters for anyone with existing wrist or finger strain specifically because mechanical switches can be selected for lighter actuation force, requiring less pressure to register a keystroke than a standard membrane keyboard, a genuine factor in repetitive strain rather than just a preference for typing feel.\n\nIf finger fatigue or strain is a specific concern, check for stated actuation force (measured in grams) rather than assuming all keyboards require the same finger pressure to type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm wireless connection type matches your actual devices, and know the battery tradeoffs",
    "explanation": "Wireless ergonomic keyboards connect via Bluetooth (works with virtually any modern device without a dongle, but can have more noticeable input latency and reconnection delay), a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver (generally lower latency and more reliable than Bluetooth, but requires a free USB port and the receiver can be lost), or wired USB (zero latency and no battery to manage, but no cable-free movement).\n\nMulti-device Bluetooth models that support pairing with several devices and switching between them are a genuine convenience for anyone alternating between a work laptop and a personal computer, but this feature isn't universal even among Bluetooth keyboards.\n\nCheck the specific connection type and, for wireless models, confirm multi-device pairing support explicitly if you need to switch between more than one computer regularly, and factor in that backlit wireless models draw more power and need more frequent charging than non-backlit equivalents."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for a negative tilt option and separate wrist rest, since flat isn't always neutral",
    "explanation": "A truly neutral wrist position during typing involves the hands tilting slightly downward from the wrist toward the keys (negative tilt), which is the opposite of the upward tilt most standard and even many \"ergonomic\" keyboards default to with their built-in feet, and only some ergonomic models offer an actual negative-tilt adjustment or come with a design that achieves this angle by default.\n\nA separate, adequately sized wrist rest matters independently of the keyboard's own tilt, since resting the wrist (not just the palm) on a support surface during typing reduces the upward bend at the wrist that a raised keyboard back otherwise creates.\n\nCheck specifically for a stated negative tilt option or a naturally downward-sloping design, and confirm whether a wrist rest is included versus needing to be purchased separately, rather than assuming any \"ergonomic\" label includes proper tilt geometry."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since some ergonomic keyboards share variants with different genuine track records",
    "explanation": "Ergonomic keyboards, especially from smaller brands, are frequently sold in multiple color or configuration variants that share the same underlying design and sometimes the same pooled review history despite being technically separate listings, which can make one specific variant's review count look artificially large or, conversely, leave a genuinely new design with almost no independent track record despite looking similar to an established model.\n\nA keyboard central to your daily work deserves a design with genuinely substantial, focused review history behind it, not just a plausible-looking rating built on a thin or shared sample.\n\nWhen comparing keyboards, especially similarly-designed variants from the same brand, check both the star rating and the review count together, and read a handful of reviews to confirm they describe the exact variant you're considering."
