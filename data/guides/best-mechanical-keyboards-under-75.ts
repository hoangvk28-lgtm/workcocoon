export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An 8000Hz Polling Rate Only Delivers Its Full Benefit With a Sufficiently Modern Processor",
    "explanation": "Polling rate measures how many times per second a keyboard reports its state to your computer, and while the Keychron V1 and V3's 8000Hz rate is 8 times faster than the industry-standard 1000Hz, the listing specifically states you need an Intel i7 9th generation, AMD Ryzen 7 2nd generation, or newer processor to reliably sustain that higher data transmission rate. This matters directly if you're using an older computer, where the keyboard may still function fine but won't deliver the full latency benefit the 8000Hz rate promises. Check your computer's specific processor generation against the keyboard's stated minimum requirement before assuming you'll experience the full performance benefit advertised."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "QMK and Web-Based Launcher Programmability Differs From Proprietary Driver Software in Long-Term Flexibility",
    "explanation": "QMK is an open-source keyboard firmware standard that the Keychron V1 and V3 access through a web-based launcher app, meaning your custom key mappings and macros are stored in an open, community-supported format that isn't dependent on one company's software staying available and updated indefinitely. A proprietary driver, like the one the AULA F75 Pro likely uses for its programmability, works fine as long as the manufacturer keeps supporting it, but ties your customization to that specific company's ongoing software maintenance. This matters more if you're the type of buyer who cares about long-term customization portability rather than just basic day-one functionality. Check whether a keyboard's programmability runs on an open standard like QMK versus a closed proprietary system if long-term software support matters to your decision."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Function Knob's Dual-Mode Design Solves a Real Problem of Needing Different Controls for Gaming vs Office Use",
    "explanation": "The AULA F75 Pro's knob specifically switches between a gaming mode, controlling RGB brightness and lighting effects, and an office mode, controlling volume and media playback, addressing the reality that a single physical control point serves genuinely different purposes depending on your current task. This matters if you actually alternate between gaming and office work on the same keyboard throughout your day, less so if you use the board exclusively for one purpose where a single-function control would suffice. Consider whether your actual daily use case genuinely alternates between these two modes before treating a dual-mode knob as a meaningful differentiator over a simpler single-function control."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Aluminum Case Construction Provides Genuine Rigidity Benefits That Plastic Cases Can't Fully Match at This Price",
    "explanation": "The Logitech G413 TKL SE's aluminum-magnesium alloy top case provides meaningfully less flex under typing pressure than the plastic cases used by the other three picks in this comparison, a genuine structural difference that affects how solid the keyboard feels during firm keystrokes or when typing on an uneven surface. This matters more if you're a heavy typist who bottoms out keys forcefully or if the keyboard will see frequent transport where case rigidity affects long-term durability. Check the listing specifically for the case material described, aluminum versus plastic or polycarbonate, since visual appearance in product photos doesn't always make the material difference obvious."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tri-Mode Wireless Connectivity to Up to 5 Devices Requires Understanding the Practical Switching Process",
    "explanation": "The AULA F75 Pro's ability to connect to 5 devices simultaneously via Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, and USB wired connections is genuinely useful, but switching between paired devices requires either shortcut keys or a side button, meaning there's a small learning curve and a brief interruption when changing which device you're actively typing on, unlike a single wired connection with zero switching required. This matters if you plan to switch between devices frequently throughout a session versus using the keyboard with one primary device most of the time. Consider how often you'd realistically switch between paired devices before treating multi-device support as a major deciding factor over a simpler wired-only board."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the Keychron V1 or V3's 8000Hz polling rate work at all on an older processor, just without the full benefit?", "a": "Yes, the keyboard still functions normally on older systems, but the listing specifically notes that reliably sustaining the full 8000Hz data transmission rate requires an Intel i7 9th gen, AMD Ryzen 7 2nd gen, or newer processor, so older systems may not see the complete latency improvement." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between the Keychron V1 and V3 at the same price?", "a": "Assuming there's a meaningful price or performance difference between them, when the actual choice comes down entirely to layout preference (75% versus TKL) and switch feel (linear versus tactile), since both share the same 8000Hz polling rate and hot-swap support." },
  { "q": "Is the AULA F75 Pro worth it over the cheaper Logitech G413 TKL SE?", "a": "If you specifically want tri-mode wireless connectivity and hot-swap switch support, yes, but if a genuinely durable aluminum build at the lowest price matters more, the Logitech pick covers that for about $10 less." },
  { "q": "How do I switch between the AULA F75 Pro's gaming mode and office mode?", "a": "A long press on the multi-function knob for about 5 seconds toggles between the two modes, after which rotating and clicking the knob controls different functions depending on which mode is active." },
  { "q": "Can I hot-swap the switches on the Logitech G413 TKL SE like the other three picks in this comparison?", "a": "No, the G413 TKL SE does not support hot-swappable switches, so if switch customization is a priority, one of the other three picks in this tier is the better choice." },
  { "q": "Do any of these keyboards work without installing manufacturer software?", "a": "Yes, all four picks function for basic typing without required software, though the Keychron V1 and V3's QMK remapping features require the web-based Keychron Launcher, and the AULA F75 Pro's macro programming requires its dedicated driver." }
