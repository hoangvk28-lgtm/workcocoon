export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Are docking station SD card readers UHS-I or UHS-II?",
    a: "Almost all built-in dock SD readers are UHS-I class, typically delivering 80-90 MB/s in real-world transfers, regardless of how fast the dock's upstream connection to your laptop is. The UGREEN 13-in-1 Thunderbolt 4 Dock in this list uses a newer SD/TF 4.0 spec that pushes closer to faster speeds, but true UHS-II performance on a built-in dock reader is rare.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a Thunderbolt dock make the SD card reader faster?",
    a: "No. Even on a Thunderbolt 4 dock capable of 40Gbps, the SD card reader is typically wired internally over a standard USB 3.0 path, so its speed ceiling stays the same as a much cheaper USB-C dock. Buy a Thunderbolt dock for display and data port bandwidth, not for a faster card reader specifically.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can using other USB ports on the dock slow down my SD card transfer?",
    a: "Yes. Most dock SD readers share internal USB 3.0 bandwidth with other ports on the same dock. If you're transferring from an SD card while an external drive or webcam is also active on the dock, your effective SD speed can drop noticeably. Unplug other active devices if you need the fastest possible card transfer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do any of these docks support CFexpress or CFast cards?",
    a: "No mainstream laptop docking station, including every pick in this list, includes a CFexpress or CFast reader. If you shoot on a professional camera using those formats, you'll need a separate dedicated CFexpress or CFast reader regardless of which dock you buy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a dock's built-in SD reader good enough for professional photo work?",
    a: "For occasional offloading, yes. For a professional workflow moving large card libraries regularly, a dedicated dual-slot UHS-II card reader connected to the dock's fastest USB-C port will typically outperform the dock's own built-in slot. Reserve the dock's reader for quick, convenience-level transfers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a UHS-II rated card actually run at UHS-II speed in a dock's SD slot?",
    a: "Only if the dock's reader itself supports UHS-II. A high-speed-rated card is limited by the slowest link in the chain, so a UHS-II card in a UHS-I dock reader will perform at UHS-I speeds. Check the dock's actual reader spec, not just your card's rating, before expecting faster transfers.",
