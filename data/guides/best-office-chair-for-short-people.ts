  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What seat height do I need if I am 5'2\"?", a: "At 5'2\", the ergonomic seat height is typically 15 to 16 inches to keep your feet flat on the floor with knees at 90 degrees. Standard office chairs start at 17 to 18 inches and will leave you sitting too high, with feet dangling or knees elevated. Look for chairs with a minimum seat height of 16 inches or lower. The Herman Miller Aeron Size A and Secretlab TITAN Evo S both reach below 16 inches." },
  { q: "Do I need a footrest if I'm short?", a: "If you cannot find a chair that lowers to your correct seat height, a footrest is the next best option. Set the chair to the height where your elbows are at 90 degrees at your desk, then use a footrest to support your feet. Adjustable-height footrests allow you to fine-tune the foot position. This is less ideal than a properly fitting chair but effective as a stopgap." },
  { q: "What is the difference between Herman Miller Aeron Size A and Size B for short people?", a: "The Herman Miller Aeron Size A has a physically smaller seat pan (narrower and shallower), a shorter back panel, and a lower seat height range (starting at 14.75 inches) compared to Size B. Size B is designed for users 5'3\" to 6'0\" and 130 to 230 lbs. Size A is designed for users below 5'3\" and 130 lbs. The ergonomic alignment of PostureFit SL works correctly for a short torso only in Size A." },
  { q: "Why doesn't my office chair lumbar support touch my lower back?", a: "Standard chair lumbar pads are positioned for average-height torsos, typically contacting the lumbar region at 8 to 11 inches above the seat pan. For short users with proportionally shorter torsos, the lumbar pad at this position makes contact in the mid-back region, not the lower lumbar. The solution is a chair with adjustable lumbar height, or placing a separate lumbar roll cushion at the correct lower position." },
  { q: "Can a short person use a standing desk ergonomically?", a: "Yes, provided the standing desk's minimum height is low enough. Standard standing desks have minimum heights of 24 to 26 inches. At 5'3\", the ergonomic standing desk height is approximately 27 to 28 inches - within reach of most desks. Sitting height at a standard 28-inch desk works for users 5'3\" and above. For users under 5'2\", verify the desk minimum before purchasing, and use a keyboard tray if needed to lower the working surface." },
