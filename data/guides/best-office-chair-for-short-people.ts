export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best office chair often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best office chair holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best office chair over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best office chair you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best office chair that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What seat height do I need if I am 5'2\"?", a: "At 5'2\", the ergonomic seat height is typically 15 to 16 inches to keep your feet flat on the floor with knees at 90 degrees. Standard office chairs start at 17 to 18 inches and will leave you sitting too high, with feet dangling or knees elevated. Look for chairs with a minimum seat height of 16 inches or lower. The Herman Miller Aeron Size A and Secretlab TITAN Evo S both reach below 16 inches." },
  { q: "Do I need a footrest if I'm short?", a: "If you cannot find a chair that lowers to your correct seat height, a footrest is the next best option. Set the chair to the height where your elbows are at 90 degrees at your desk, then use a footrest to support your feet. Adjustable-height footrests allow you to fine-tune the foot position. This is less ideal than a properly fitting chair but effective as a stopgap." },
  { q: "What is the difference between Herman Miller Aeron Size A and Size B for short people?", a: "The Herman Miller Aeron Size A has a physically smaller seat pan (narrower and shallower), a shorter back panel, and a lower seat height range (starting at 14.75 inches) compared to Size B. Size B is designed for users 5'3\" to 6'0\" and 130 to 230 lbs. Size A is designed for users below 5'3\" and 130 lbs. The ergonomic alignment of PostureFit SL works correctly for a short torso only in Size A." },
  { q: "Why doesn't my office chair lumbar support touch my lower back?", a: "Standard chair lumbar pads are positioned for average-height torsos, typically contacting the lumbar region at 8 to 11 inches above the seat pan. For short users with proportionally shorter torsos, the lumbar pad at this position makes contact in the mid-back region, not the lower lumbar. The solution is a chair with adjustable lumbar height, or placing a separate lumbar roll cushion at the correct lower position." },
  { q: "Can a short person use a standing desk ergonomically?", a: "Yes, provided the standing desk's minimum height is low enough. Standard standing desks have minimum heights of 24 to 26 inches. At 5'3\", the ergonomic standing desk height is approximately 27 to 28 inches - within reach of most desks. Sitting height at a standard 28-inch desk works for users 5'3\" and above. For users under 5'2\", verify the desk minimum before purchasing, and use a keyboard tray if needed to lower the working surface." },
