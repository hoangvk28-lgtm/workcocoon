  "A triple-monitor docking station has to solve a bandwidth problem before it solves a cable problem, since driving three 4K displays at once takes more data than a single Thunderbolt or USB-C connection was ever designed to carry uncompressed. Most docks get there with DisplayLink software compression on at least one display, a few use native Thunderbolt MST on Windows, and on a base-chip Mac, no dock can add a third native display no matter how many ports it has.",
  "Below are 8 docking stations we evaluated on how many displays they can genuinely drive at once, DisplayLink vs native output method, power delivery for sustained triple-display use, and real compatibility across Windows and Mac, ranging from a $129.99 entry-level dual-4K unit to a $227.99 14-port DisplayLink dock built specifically for three screens.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Can any docking station give my base M1/M2/M3 MacBook 3 native external displays?",
    a: "No. A base-chip MacBook supports only 1 native external display regardless of the dock used; this is a chip-level limitation, not a dock limitation. To reach 3 displays on a base-chip Mac, you need a DisplayLink-based dock like the Anker Prime DL7400 or WAVLINK Neo, which drive the extra displays through software compression rather than native GPU output.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between DisplayLink and native Thunderbolt for driving 3 monitors?",
    a: "DisplayLink intercepts the GPU's video output and compresses it as USB data, which lets it drive more displays than the laptop's GPU natively supports, at the cost of some CPU overhead and no support for Windows color calibration tools or macOS-native scaling. Native Thunderbolt (via MST) or native GPU output has no such compromise, but is limited by however many displays the laptop's chip and GPU can actually drive.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a special dock for 3 monitors, or can I use my laptop's built-in port for one of them?",
    a: "Using your laptop's own HDMI or USB-C port for a third display while a dual-display dock handles the other 2 is a legitimate and cheaper approach, used by picks like the WAVLINK Pro Dual 4K in this list. It only works if your laptop actually has a spare display-capable port; check your laptop's port layout before choosing this path over a true triple-display dock.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does only 1 of my dock's 3 monitor outputs reach 4K while the other 2 are 1080p?",
    a: "This is a deliberate bandwidth and cost trade some docks make, splitting available bandwidth so the primary output gets full 4K@60Hz while the secondary outputs are capped at 1080p@60Hz. If you need all 3 screens at matched 4K resolution, choose a pick explicitly rated for triple 4K@60Hz, like the Anker Prime DL7400 or WAVLINK 12-in-1 Neo.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a triple-monitor dock slow down my other USB devices?",
    a: "It can. Driving 3 displays through DisplayLink consumes a real share of USB bandwidth, and if a fast peripheral like an external SSD or a high-resolution webcam shares the same USB controller, you may notice reduced throughput on that device while all 3 displays are active. Docks with dedicated USB 3.0 ports separate from the display-driving circuitry handle this better.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is MST better than DisplayLink for a triple-monitor Windows setup?",
    a: "Where it's supported, yes, MST drives multiple displays natively over Thunderbolt with no drivers and no CPU overhead, avoiding DisplayLink's compression tradeoffs entirely. The catch is that MST support depends on your specific laptop's GPU and Thunderbolt controller, not just the dock, so confirm your laptop supports MST daisy-chained displays before buying a dock like the Dell Pro SD25TB4 specifically for that feature.",
