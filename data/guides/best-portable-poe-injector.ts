export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Removable Battery Design Suits Mobile Use While a Continuous DC Input Design Suits a Fixed Installation",
    "explanation": "A portable injector built around swappable cordless tool batteries lets a field technician keep working by swapping in a charged battery, ideal for moving between multiple job sites in a day, while a continuous DC input design expects an ongoing power connection like a solar panel or vehicle electrical system and isn't meant to be unplugged and moved frequently. This matters significantly for a mobile network installer or troubleshooter who values not carrying a separate dedicated battery pack, and matters less for a fixed remote installation that stays powered continuously once set up. Match the power delivery style to whether your actual use case is mobile and intermittent or fixed and continuous."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Wider DC Input Voltage Range Accommodates More Power Source Variability Without a Separate Voltage Regulator",
    "explanation": "The listings in this comparison range from a 12-30V input up to a 12-60V input, and a wider range means the same injector can accept power from a broader variety of sources, from a standard 12V car battery to a higher-voltage solar setup, without needing a separate voltage regulation step first. This matters more if you're not certain of your exact power source's voltage or if you might use the injector across multiple different projects with varying power sources, and matters less if you have one known, fixed voltage source you'll always use. Check your specific power source's actual voltage against a listing's stated input range before assuming any DC-input injector works with any DC source."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Compatibility With Specific Radio or Access Point Brands Confirms Real-World Field Testing",
    "explanation": "A listing that specifically names compatibility with equipment like ePMP2000/3000, Force400/425, or TP-Link EAP-225 access points suggests the manufacturer has confirmed real-world compatibility with that specific hardware, rather than relying solely on generic PoE standard compliance claims. This matters more if you're working with specialized point-to-point radio or wireless bridge equipment where power negotiation quirks are more common, and matters less with standard, widely compatible IP cameras or access points. Check for named compatibility with your specific equipment brand when working with less common or specialized wireless hardware."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Auto-Shutdown and Diode Isolation Are Genuine Safety Features Worth Checking on a Portable Unit Used Across Multiple Sites",
    "explanation": "An auto-shutdown feature that powers down when no device is connected prevents wasted energy draw on a battery-powered unit, extending usable time between charges, while diode isolation between power inputs prevents cross-feeding that could otherwise damage the unit or connected equipment if multiple power sources are present. This matters more for a unit moved between different sites and power sources regularly, where these protective features reduce the risk of a mistake during setup, and matters less for a single fixed installation with one confirmed power source. Check for these specific safety features when a portable injector will see frequent setup and teardown across different locations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Portable Injector's Physical Size and Weight Matter More Than They Do for a Fixed Installation",
    "explanation": "A unit meant to be carried in a field technician's bag or toolkit benefits from a genuinely compact and lightweight design, like the Portable Combo pick's stated 6.9 ounces and pocket-sized dimensions, while a fixed installation cares much less about physical size since the unit stays mounted in one place indefinitely. This matters significantly if the injector needs to travel with a technician between multiple job sites in a single day, and matters little for a unit that gets installed once in a remote cabinet or enclosure and never moved again. Weigh the physical portability of a unit against your actual need to carry and reposition it regularly."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I power a PoE injector from a cordless drill battery?", "a": "Yes, but only a purpose-built unit like the Portable Combo pick in this comparison, which is specifically designed to accept common DeWalt and Milwaukee cordless tool batteries; a standard injector cannot use these batteries directly." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between a portable and a standard PoE injector?", "a": "A portable or battery-powered PoE injector is specifically designed to run from a non-standard power source, like a cordless tool battery, solar panel, or vehicle's 12V system, rather than requiring a standard AC wall outlet." },
  { "q": "Can I use a car battery to power a PoE injector for a dash cam or dome camera setup?", "a": "Yes, a DC-input injector designed for a 12-30V range, like the PoE Texas inline converter in this comparison, specifically accommodates a vehicle's 12V electrical system." },
  { "q": "Is a wider DC input voltage range always better for a portable injector?", "a": "It's more flexible, letting you use the same unit across different power sources, but if you have one known fixed voltage source, a narrower-range unit matched exactly to that voltage works just as well at a potentially lower price." },
  { "q": "How long does a battery-powered PoE injector run on one charge?", "a": "This depends entirely on the specific battery used and the connected device's power draw; a purpose-built unit with an auto-shutdown feature extends usable time by powering down when no device is connected." },
  { "q": "Can I use a solar-compatible PoE injector for a permanent installation without solar power?", "a": "Yes, a wide-range DC input injector designed for solar applications works equally well with any compatible DC power source, including a standard battery bank or DC power supply, not just solar panels specifically." }
