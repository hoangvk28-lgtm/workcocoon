export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Power Adapter's Headline Wattage Is Not the Same as the Actual Power Delivery Reaching Your Laptop",
    "explanation": "The Dell WD19DCS pick specifically discloses that its 240W power adapter actually delivers 210W of real Power Delivery to Dell systems, a genuinely important distinction from simply advertising '240W' as if that full figure reaches your laptop, since some of the adapter's total capacity powers the dock's own operation and downstream ports. This matters directly when comparing charging performance across docks with similar headline adapter wattages, where the actual delivered PD figure is what determines real charging speed, and matters less if you're not pushing your laptop's charging needs to the absolute limit anyway. Look for a dock's specifically disclosed actual PD wattage figure, not just its power adapter's total rating, when comparing real charging performance across different docks."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Non-Dell Systems Often Receive Meaningfully Less Power Than the Dock's Dell-Specific Rating Suggests",
    "explanation": "The Dell WD19DCS pick specifically states it provides 90W to non-Dell systems compared to 210W for Dell systems, a substantial difference that matters directly if you're considering a Dell-branded dock for use with a non-Dell laptop, where you'd receive less than half the charging power Dell-branded systems get from the identical hardware. This matters significantly if you own a non-Dell laptop and are evaluating these docks based on their headline Dell-specific wattage figures, and matters less if you exclusively use genuine Dell hardware where the full rated wattage applies. Check a Dell-branded dock's specifically disclosed non-Dell system wattage figure before assuming the dock's headline power rating will apply equally to your own non-Dell laptop."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Workstation Compatibility Confirms a Dock Was Actually Validated for Your Specific Hardware Generation",
    "explanation": "The TB18DC pick specifically confirms compatibility with Dell Precision Mobile Workstation 7530 and 7730 models by name, while the TB16 pick specifically states Windows 7/8/8.1/10 compatibility with no macOS mentioned, meaning each dock was engineered and validated for a specific hardware and software generation rather than a generic 'Dell compatible' claim. This matters significantly if you own one of these exact named models or run one of these exact operating systems, where confirmed compatibility gives real assurance the dock was tested against your specific setup, and matters less if you own a different Dell model or run macOS, where compatibility becomes less certain. Check a dock's specifically named compatible model list and operating system support against your exact laptop and OS before assuming broad 'Dell compatible' branding covers your specific hardware."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Modular, Upgradeable Dock Design Offers Long-Term Flexibility a Fixed-Configuration Dock Cannot Match",
    "explanation": "The WD19DCS pick's specifically described modular design, described as the world's first modular dock with upgradeable power and connectivity, lets you swap or upgrade specific components as your needs evolve, rather than needing to replace the entire dock when your requirements outgrow its fixed original specifications. This matters if you're planning for long-term use across multiple laptop upgrades or evolving workflow needs, where the modular design avoids full replacement costs down the road, and matters less if you expect to replace the entire dock anyway within a few years regardless of upgrade options. Consider whether a modular upgrade path adds genuine long-term value for your specific usage timeline before choosing a fixed-configuration dock purely based on a lower upfront price."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Complete Included Cable Bundle Saves Real Setup Time and Additional Purchases",
    "explanation": "The WD19DC pick specifically includes both HDMI and DisplayPort cables plus a microfiber cleaning cloth in the box, a genuinely complete out-of-box package that eliminates the need to separately source display cables before you can actually use the dock's full display capability. This matters if you don't already own the specific cables needed for your monitor setup, where a complete bundle saves both money and a delay before your dock is fully functional, and matters less if you already own high-quality HDMI and DisplayPort cables from other equipment. Check whether a dock's listed price includes the display cables you'll actually need, or whether you'll need to budget for separate cable purchases to use its full display capability."

  { "q": "Will I get the full 240W of charging power from these docks?", "a": "No, the Dell WD19DCS listing specifically clarifies its 240W adapter delivers 210W of actual Power Delivery to Dell systems and only 90W to non-Dell systems, so the adapter's headline 240W figure does not represent the full wattage reaching your laptop." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 240W dock?", "a": "Assuming the full 240W adapter rating reaches their laptop as usable charging power, when the actual disclosed Power Delivery figure is typically meaningfully lower, and lower still for non-Dell systems connected to a Dell-branded dock." },
  { "q": "Is the WD19DCS worth the extra cost over the WD19DC if I don't need the modular upgrade feature?", "a": "If you don't anticipate needing future power or connectivity upgrades, the WD19DC's complete cable bundle and slightly lower price make it the more straightforward choice, while the WD19DCS's modular design is worth the premium only if long-term upgradeability genuinely matters to you." },
  { "q": "Can I use the TB18DC dock with a Dell laptop other than the Precision 7530 or 7730?", "a": "The listing specifically confirms compatibility with the Precision Mobile Workstation 7530 and 7730 models, so checking Dell's own compatibility documentation for other specific Dell laptop models before assuming universal compatibility is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Do these Dell docks work with non-Dell laptops at all?", "a": "Some do, though typically at reduced charging wattage; the WD19DCS specifically states it provides 90W to non-Dell systems, so checking each specific dock's stated non-Dell compatibility and wattage before purchase is worth doing if you don't own a Dell laptop." },
  { "q": "Is the TB16 dock's Thunderbolt 3 interface too outdated for a current laptop?", "a": "Thunderbolt 3 remains backward compatible with newer Thunderbolt 4 and some USB4 laptops, though you won't get the bandwidth improvements of newer standards, so checking your specific laptop's port generation against this dock's Thunderbolt 3 interface is worth doing before purchase." }
