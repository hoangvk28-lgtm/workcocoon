    q: "What is the difference between a one-piece electric standing desk and a frame-only desk?",
    a: "A one-piece desk includes both the motorized frame and the desktop surface in the listing price. A frame-only desk covers only the motorized legs and crossbeam - no desktop surface is included. All six picks on this list are one-piece complete desks. Many FlexiSpot E5, E7, and Uplift listings are frame-only. Check if the listing shows a complete desk with a surface in the photos.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find my correct standing desk height?",
    a: "Your ideal standing desk height equals your elbow height when standing, minus 1 to 2 inches. To measure: stand in comfortable shoes, let your arms hang naturally, bend at the elbow to 90 degrees, and measure from the floor to the bottom of your forearm. That measurement minus 1 inch is your target desk height.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does anti-collision detection do on a standing desk?",
    a: "When the desk motor encounters resistance during upward movement - a chair arm, a hanging cable, someone's hand - the motor's current draw spikes. The controller detects this spike, stops the motor, and reverses direction 1 to 2 inches. Without anti-collision, the motor continues driving against resistance until something breaks. Anti-collision means you can safely use memory presets without watching the desk rise every time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 48 inches wide enough for a home office desk?",
    a: "For a single monitor setup, 48 inches is comfortable. For dual 24\" monitors, 48 inches fits with about 2 inches of margin on each side - workable but tight. For dual 27\" monitors side by side, 48 inches is very tight and a monitor arm is strongly recommended. If your planned setup is dual 27\" monitors, start with 55\" width instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "How loud is an electric standing desk motor?",
    a: "Most budget electric standing desk motors operate between 45 and 55 dB during height adjustment. At 50 dB, you are hearing roughly the equivalent of a normal conversation at 3 feet - clearly audible but not disruptive. The Veken on this list publishes its motor noise spec at under 52 dB. Most manufacturers do not publish motor noise specs. A standing desk motor runs for 10 to 20 seconds per adjustment, so even a louder motor is rarely a problem in practice.",
