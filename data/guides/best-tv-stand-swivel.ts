  "Swivel TV stands fall into two very different categories that product photos rarely make clear. Tabletop swivel bases replace the factory legs on your TV and need an existing dresser, console, or media unit underneath them, while full floor stands are standalone furniture with built-in shelving that need no other surface at all.",
  "Swivel range is another spot where listings get confusing. A stand advertised as a 30 degree swivel usually means 30 degrees to each side for 60 degrees total, while a listing that says 60 degree swivel may already be describing the full range, so the same physical motion can read as either number depending on how the seller phrases it.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand swivel often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand swivel holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand swivel over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand swivel you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand swivel that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a tabletop swivel stand and a floor swivel stand?",
    a: "A tabletop swivel stand replaces your TV's factory legs and needs an existing piece of furniture, like a dresser or media console, to sit on. A floor swivel stand is standalone furniture with its own base and shelving that stands directly on the floor without needing anything underneath it. Check whether a product photo shows the stand resting on furniture or on bare floor before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a 30 degree swivel mean the same thing as a 60 degree swivel?",
    a: "Not necessarily, and it depends on how the listing measures the spec. Many stands list swivel as degrees to one side, so a 30 degree swivel spec often means 30 degrees each way for 60 degrees total. Other listings state the full range directly as 60 degrees. When comparing products, look for whether the description clarifies each side or total range, since the same physical motion can be labeled either way.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a tabletop swivel base go directly on the floor?",
    a: "No. Tabletop swivel bases are designed to sit on top of furniture at a height that puts the screen at eye level from a seated position. Placed directly on the floor, the TV would sit too low for comfortable viewing and the base's mounting posts are not engineered for floor-level stability the way a standalone floor stand's wider base is.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much weight can a swivel TV stand hold?",
    a: "Capacity varies by product in this roundup from 88 lbs on the smaller tabletop bases up to 143 lbs on the FITUEYES floor stand. Check your specific TV's weight, not just its screen size, against the stand's rated capacity, since panel weight varies by TV model even within the same size class.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do swivel TV stands work with any TV brand?",
    a: "Most swivel stands in this roundup are described as universal and rely on VESA mounting hole compatibility rather than TV brand. Confirm your TV's VESA pattern against the stand's supported range before ordering, since brand alone does not determine compatibility.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a floor swivel stand better than a tabletop base?",
    a: "Neither is universally better, it depends on your room. A floor stand is the right choice if you have no existing furniture to place a TV on and want built-in shelving or storage. A tabletop base is the better choice if you already own a dresser or console you want to keep using and just need the TV itself to swivel and adjust in height.",
