A rocking function adds gentle back-and-forth motion, and the included headrest and lumbar pillow work alongside the massage feature for extra support. A 1.8mm steel frame backs the 300 lb capacity, and assembly takes about 30 minutes. With 77,842 ratings and a 4.4 star average, it has by far the highest review count of any chair in this guide, reflecting years as a proven best-seller.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "How does the massage function work on a gaming chair?",
    a: "Most gaming chairs with massage, like the Homall Classic and Yaheetech models, use a small vibration motor embedded in the lumbar pillow, powered by USB from a power bank or wall adapter. Premium models like the Dowinx Shiatsu chair use a rotating shiatsu mechanism at the neck instead of simple vibration, and the Dowinx Heated model adds a finger-simulation motion that mimics a kneading massage rather than just vibrating.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to supply my own power source for the massage feature?",
    a: "Check the specific listing, since USB-powered massage lumbar pillows on chairs like the Homall Classic and Yaheetech typically need a power source such as a USB power bank or wall adapter to be plugged in, which may or may not be included depending on the bundle. Confirm what's included before buying if you don't already have a spare USB power bank.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a heated massage chair worth the extra cost?",
    a: "The Dowinx Heated model at $179.99 is the most expensive chair in this guide because it combines back heating with finger-simulation massage, going beyond the vibration-only massage on cheaper chairs like the $77.99 Yaheetech. Heat therapy is worth it if you specifically deal with muscle stiffness that responds to warmth, but if lumbar support is your only concern, a cheaper vibration massage chair delivers similar relief for less money.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a massage gaming chair replace a dedicated massage chair?",
    a: "No. Gaming chairs with massage, including every model in this guide, use a single lumbar or neck massage pad rather than the full-body rollers and airbags found in dedicated massage recliners. They're best understood as a gaming or desk chair with a helpful add-on feature, not a substitute for a purpose-built massage chair.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which massage gaming chair is best for big and tall users?",
    a: "The Meilocar Big & Tall in this guide is purpose-built for larger users, with a 330 lb capacity, a taller 17.9 to 22 inch seat height range, and an extra-wide 90 to 160 degree recline, compared to the 270 to 300 lb capacity on most other chairs here.",
