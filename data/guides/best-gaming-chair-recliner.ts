export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity against your actual body weight with real safety margin",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's rated weight capacity is the absolute maximum before the frame, gas lift, and casters are at real risk of failure, not a comfortable operating range, so a chair rated just barely above your actual weight is running much closer to its structural limit than a chair with genuine headroom.\n\nThis matters because a chair operating near its weight limit tends to develop wobble, sagging, or gas-lift failure faster than one with real margin, even if it doesn't fail outright.\n\nCheck the listed weight capacity, and favor a chair rated at least 50-75 lbs above your actual weight rather than one that just barely clears it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify lumbar support is genuinely adjustable, not just a fixed cushion",
    "explanation": "Many gaming chairs include a lumbar cushion or built-in curve marketed as \"ergonomic support,\" but a fixed, non-adjustable lumbar shape only fits correctly for a body proportioned exactly the way the chair was designed for, while a genuinely adjustable lumbar system (height-adjustable, inflatable, or a repositionable pillow) can be tuned to your actual lower back curve.\n\nThis matters directly if you experience real lower back discomfort during long sessions, a fixed lumbar shape that doesn't match your body can be worse than no lumbar support at all.\n\nCheck whether lumbar support is described as adjustable and how (height, firmness, or position), not just whether the word \"lumbar\" appears in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider armrest range of motion for your actual desk height and typing posture",
    "explanation": "Armrest adjustability ranges from simple height-only adjustment to full 4D armrests that move up, down, forward, back, and pivot, and this range matters directly for matching the armrest height to your specific desk and keyboard position, a mismatched armrest height forces shoulders up or wrists at an awkward angle during long sessions.\n\nThis matters more for anyone spending many hours daily typing or gaming, less for occasional use where posture matters less.\n\nCheck the specific armrest adjustment axes listed (2D, 3D, or 4D), not just whether armrests are present, and match that against how much your desk height or seating position varies."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh recline range and locking positions against how you actually use the chair",
    "explanation": "Recline range varies from a modest 90-135 degrees on basic gaming chairs to a near-flat 180 degrees on recliner-style models, and a wider recline range only matters if you'll actually use it, for napping, watching content reclined, or relaxing between gaming sessions, versus sitting upright for focused work or gaming most of the time.\n\nThis matters because a chair with an impressive recline range but a weak recline lock can feel unstable at extreme angles, while a more basic recline range with a solid lock mechanism holds position reliably.\n\nCheck both the maximum recline angle and whether the recline lock holds at multiple positions, not just the maximum angle alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check base material and caster quality for real long-term stability",
    "explanation": "The 5-star base and caster wheels bear the chair's full weight through thousands of rolling and swiveling cycles over the chair's life, and material quality here varies significantly, a genuine steel or reinforced nylon base holds up far better under real weight than a cheaper plastic base that can crack or flex over time, and caster wheel quality affects both smooth rolling and floor protection.\n\nThis matters more for a heavier user or daily long-session use, less for occasional light use.\n\nCheck the listed base material specifically, not just the overall chair material, and check reviews for mentions of base or caster durability after months of use, not just initial assembly quality."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a gaming chair recliner and a regular gaming chair?",
    a: "A standard gaming chair typically reclines to around 130-155 degrees using a single tilt mechanism built into the seat. A gaming chair recliner, like the RESPAWN 900 or the fully flat Homall models in this guide, uses a dedicated recline mechanism, often with a separate footrest, and in some cases skips wheels entirely for a console-style, sofa-like build.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a gaming chair recliner actually recline flat to 180 degrees?",
    a: "Yes, but only specific models. Both Homall recliners in this guide recline fully flat to 180 degrees, while the RESPAWN 110 Pro tops out at 155 degrees and the RESPAWN 900 at 135 degrees. Check the stated maximum recline angle directly rather than assuming all recliners go flat.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do gaming chair recliners need wheels?",
    a: "It depends on your setup. The RESPAWN 900 deliberately skips wheels for added stability in a fixed console gaming spot near a TV. Wheeled recliners like the RESPAWN 110 Pro and Homall models are more practical if you want to move the chair between a desk and a relaxed reclining position.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are big and tall gaming chair recliners worth it if I'm under 275 lbs?",
    a: "Not necessarily. Standard recliners in this guide rated for 265-300 lbs, like the Homall or Yaheetech models, are built and priced for that range. The Homall Big & Tall's 400 lb capacity is a real advantage for larger users, but it comes with the lowest rating in this guide at 4.0 stars and very few reviews, so it's worth the added capacity only if you specifically need it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I expect to pay for a quality gaming chair recliner?",
    a: "This guide ranges from $77.99 (Yaheetech) up to $314.45 (RESPAWN 900). Budget options around $100-130, like both Homall recliners, deliver a genuinely flat 180-degree recline. Paying more, as with the RESPAWN models, buys you a longer 5-year warranty, a console-style build, and in the 900's case, an independent footrest mechanism rather than better recline range alone.",
