  "A whiteboard advertised with \"storage\" can mean anything from a full built-in drawer to a single accessory tray, a distinction most general roundups gloss over. We only included picks below where the listing explicitly states a drawer, tray, or organizer feature, and we describe exactly what type of storage each one includes rather than a vague \"storage included\" claim.",
  "Adding a drawer or tray to a whiteboard also adds weight and structural stress to the stand, something a static product photo can't confirm holds up under daily use. Treat stand stability with a loaded drawer as a buyer-advisory check worth verifying via current reviews before you commit, especially if you plan to keep the drawer full.",
