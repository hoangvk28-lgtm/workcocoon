export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Individual Outlet Switches Solve a Real Daily Annoyance a Single Master Switch Doesn't",
    "explanation": "The Chiefway pick's 6 independent switches let you power off one specific device, such as a desk lamp before bed, without unplugging it or affecting other devices still connected to the same strip, a genuine convenience most single-switch power strips can't replicate. A strip with only a master switch requires either leaving everything on or turning off every connected device simultaneously, which isn't always what you want. Consider whether you regularly need to power devices independently before assuming a master switch alone meets your daily usage pattern."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Vertical Tower Design Trades Horizontal Desk Space for Vertical Footprint, Not a Universal Upgrade",
    "explanation": "The NTONPOWER and 12-outlet tower picks both use a vertical design specifically to maximize outlet count without spreading across a desk horizontally, a genuine space-saving advantage on a cluttered desk, but this only helps if you actually have vertical clearance, such as under a shelf or beside a monitor stand, where a tall tower fits comfortably. A tower placed somewhere with limited vertical clearance, like inside a shallow desk drawer or under a low cabinet, may not fit as well as a flat strip would. Measure your actual available space in both dimensions before assuming a tower design is automatically the better space-saving choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cord Length Differences at This Tier Can Span a 3x Range, a Genuinely Practical Consideration",
    "explanation": "The 12-outlet tower pick's 16.5-foot cord is nearly three times longer than the Chiefway pick's 6-foot cord, a difference that matters directly if your desk or entertainment center sits far from the nearest wall outlet. Buying a strip with a cord too short for your actual setup means either needing a separate extension cord, adding another point of failure and cost, or being unable to position the strip where you actually need it. Measure the actual distance from your nearest outlet to where you plan to use the strip before assuming any cord length will comfortably reach."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cruise-Friendly Design Is a Specific, Documented Feature That Matters Only in a Narrow Use Case",
    "explanation": "The Chiefway pick is specifically engineered without surge protection circuitry to comply with cruise ship policies that commonly restrict power strips with surge protection due to fire safety concerns in that specific environment, a genuine niche feature that most buyers won't need but that matters significantly if you do travel by cruise regularly. For any other use case, home, office, or standard travel, a strip with surge protection is generally the better, more protective choice. Check for this specific cruise-friendly designation only if you have an actual, recurring need for it, rather than assuming it's a universal advantage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UL 1363 and UL 1449 Certifications Cover Different Aspects of Power Strip Safety",
    "explanation": "UL 1363 specifically certifies a power strip's basic performance and construction standards, while UL 1449 certifies surge protective device performance specifically, and the DEWENWILS pick's dual certification under both standards provides more comprehensive documented safety verification than a strip certified under only one standard or neither. This distinction matters because a strip could meet basic construction standards without necessarily having its surge protection circuitry independently verified, or vice versa. Check whether a listing cites one or both certifications to understand how comprehensively its safety claims have actually been independently verified."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use the Chiefway power strip on a cruise ship without it being confiscated?", "a": "It's specifically designed without surge protection circuitry to comply with common cruise line restrictions on power strips, though you should always verify your specific cruise line's current policy before traveling, since rules can vary." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between a tower and a flat power strip?", "a": "Assuming a tower design always saves more space, when a tower actually requires sufficient vertical clearance to be practical, and a flat strip may work better in a shallow drawer or under very low shelving." },
  { "q": "Is the NTONPOWER 16-outlet tower worth it over the 12-outlet tower with the longer cord?", "a": "If you need the maximum number of outlets and don't need an extra-long cord, yes, but if reaching a distant outlet without an extension cord matters more, the 12-outlet tower's 16.5-foot cord is the better fit despite fewer total outlets." },
  { "q": "How do individual switches on the Chiefway pick actually work in practice?", "a": "Each of the 6 outlets has its own dedicated switch, so flipping one switch off only cuts power to that specific outlet, leaving the other 5 outlets and their connected devices fully powered and unaffected." },
  { "q": "Does the DEWENWILS pick's lack of USB ports make it a worse choice overall?", "a": "Not necessarily, if you don't need built-in USB charging and specifically want a certified, long-corded power strip for standard AC devices, the DEWENWILS pick's dual UL certification and 15-foot cord make it a solid choice despite lacking USB ports." },
  { "q": "Can the 16.5-foot cord tower be used safely with its length fully extended indoors?", "a": "Yes, the cord is designed for indoor extension use and includes the same safety protections as the strip's outlets, though you should avoid running any extension cord under rugs or through high-traffic areas where it could be a trip hazard." }
