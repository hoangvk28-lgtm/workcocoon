Second priority: a desk lamp with a clamp mount that takes zero surface space. These two purchases change the baseline look of any desk setup before anything else." },
  { q: "Do I need a monitor stand if I already have a monitor arm?", a: "No -- a monitor arm replaces a monitor stand entirely and does it better (more adjustable, no surface footprint). If you have an arm, skip the stand and use the budget on something else. If you don't have an arm and aren't planning to install one, a monitor stand is the simpler and cheaper solution." },
  { q: "Is a desk mat worth it?", a: "Yes for most setups. It protects the desk surface (relevant at move-out if you're renting), provides a consistent mouse tracking surface, cushions your wrists during long sessions, and unifies the visual look of your desk. A 35x17\" mat for $30-$50 is one of the higher-ROI desk purchases at this price." },
  { q: "What USB hub should I buy for a MacBook?", a: "If your MacBook is USB-C only (2017+), buy a USB-C hub rather than a USB-A hub -- the SABRENT 7-Port USB-C Hub is the right pick (available at our full USB hub guide). The Anker 7-port on this list is USB-A only and requires a dongle on modern MacBooks." },
  { q: "Do artificial plants look cheap on a desk?", a: "Quality ones don't -- the FUNARTY and CADNLY sets use realistic textures and white ceramic pots that read as intentional at desk distance. The tell is the pot quality more than the plant itself; cheap plastic pots look fake immediately. Both picks on this list use ceramic pots." },
  { q: "What's the best desk accessory for someone working from home?", a: "A powered USB hub if you have multiple devices, then a monitor stand or arm. Remote workers on video calls benefit most from having the camera at eye level (monitor stand fixes this) and visible background organization (cable tray + desk organizer). These three purchases address the most common work-from-home desk problems." },
