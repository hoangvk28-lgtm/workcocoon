  {
    q: "Do I need a 4K webcam for home office meetings?",
    a: "No. Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet all cap delivery resolution at 1080p for video calls. A 4K webcam only helps if you record video locally to your computer or stream at high resolution to platforms like YouTube. For daily meetings, 1080p is all you need.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does Teams certified or Zoom certified mean?",
    a: "Certified means the camera manufacturer worked directly with Microsoft or Zoom to test the hardware. Certified cameras get plug-and-play driver support, often get bandwidth priority on the platform, and receive coordinated firmware updates. A camera marked compatible just means it works as a USB device. For IT-managed setups, certification matters. For personal home offices, compatible cameras work fine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 720p good enough for video calls in 2026?",
    a: "For most participants viewing you on a laptop or standard monitor, 720p at good lighting is acceptable. The Microsoft LifeCam Cinema at 720p looks better in decent light than a cheap 1080p camera in bad light. If you frequently present to large conference room screens or your role involves a lot of on-camera presence, 1080p is worth the upgrade.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is AI framing and do I need it?",
    a: "AI framing means the camera uses software to detect your face and automatically adjust the zoom and crop to keep you centered in frame. It is useful if you stand up during calls, teach from a whiteboard, or move around your desk. If you sit still at a fixed distance from your monitor, you do not need it. The OBSBOT Meet SE and Anker PowerConf C300 both include it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a webcam with a built-in microphone or a separate headset?",
    a: "A webcam microphone is convenient for occasional calls. For daily use in a home office with background noise, a dedicated headset microphone is significantly better for the people listening to you. See our best headset for work guide for recommendations across all budgets.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does lighting matter more than the webcam itself?",
    a: "Yes, in most cases. No camera compensates for sitting with a bright window directly behind you or harsh overhead lighting casting shadows on your face. A $20 USB LED panel placed in front of you will produce better results than upgrading from a $70 camera to a $200 camera in the same lighting conditions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which webcam is best for a standing desk?",
    a: "Any webcam with AI auto-framing. The OBSBOT Meet SE or Anker PowerConf C300 both adjust their zoom and crop as you transition between sitting and standing. Fixed cameras like the Logitech C920S will frame you correctly for one height only.",
