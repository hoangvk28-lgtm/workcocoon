export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C is a connector, not a speed",
    "explanation": "A USB-C port can carry 10, 20, 40, or 80Gbps depending on the underlying protocol. Require the exact USB/Thunderbolt protocol and link rate from the listing, not USB-C wording alone, before assuming an enclosure matches your host's real speed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the bridge controller, not just the interface label",
    "explanation": "Two enclosures with the same 40Gbps label can behave differently depending on the bridge chip (ASM2464PD, JHL7440, RTL9210, and others each have different real-world characteristics). Where a listing names its controller, treat that as a real signal of build quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify NVMe-only versus NVMe+SATA support",
    "explanation": "Some enclosures in this category support only NVMe M-Key SSDs, others add SATA/NGFF support via M+B Key. Confirm which protocol your specific SSD uses before buying, since a mismatch means the drive simply won't work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Separate peak benchmark speed from sustained performance",
    "explanation": "A short benchmark can hit peak speed even on a design that throttles heavily during long transfers. Favor listings that publish tested read/write numbers with a named SSD and host over theoretical link-rate claims alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your exact M.2 size and keying before buying",
    "explanation": "2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280 SSDs are not interchangeable in every enclosure, and M-Key versus B+M Key compatibility varies by product. Check your SSD's exact length and key type against the listing's stated support, not just \"M.2 compatible\"."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable and host requirements can silently cap speed",
    "explanation": "A USB-C cable rated below the enclosure's maximum speed, or a host port that doesn't support the exact protocol claimed, will cap real throughput well below the advertised number. Check both before assuming full speed."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a faster enclosure automatically mean faster real-world transfers?",
    "a": "Not necessarily. Real throughput depends on the SSD's own generation and speed, the bridge controller inside the enclosure, cable quality, and whether the host port actually supports the claimed protocol. A 40Gbps enclosure with a slow SSD won't outperform a 10Gbps enclosure with a fast one by much."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use any M.2 NVMe SSD in any enclosure in this list?",
    "a": "No. Check the exact M.2 length (2230/2242/2260/2280) and keying (M-Key vs B+M Key) the enclosure supports against your specific SSD before buying, and confirm whether the enclosure supports NVMe only or also SATA M.2 drives."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my enclosure run slower than its advertised speed?",
    "a": "The most common causes are a host port that doesn't actually support the claimed protocol (many Macs cap USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 at 10Gbps, for example), an underrated USB-C cable, or sustained thermal throttling on a fanless design during a long transfer."
