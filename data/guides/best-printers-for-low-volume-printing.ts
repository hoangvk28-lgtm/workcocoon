  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    q: "How much ink does a new printer waste on startup calibration?",
    a: "New printers run an alignment and calibration routine the first time they're powered on, which consumes a real slice of the included starter cartridge before you print anything else. It's worth budgeting for a slightly shorter first-cartridge lifespan than advertised.",
  },
  {
    q: "When does a laser printer make sense for a low-volume household?",
    a: "Generally once you're consistently printing more than 100-300 pages a month, especially text-heavy documents. Below that, the higher upfront cost of a laser printer usually doesn't pay off fast enough against a basic cartridge inkjet.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I stop my inkjet cartridges from drying out?",
    a: "Print a test page every 1-2 weeks even without a real need to, which keeps the nozzles from clogging. Cartridges left idle for 2-4 weeks are the ones most likely to trigger a wasted cleaning cycle on the printer's next use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the inkless thermal printer a good main printer?",
    a: "No. The MT610Pro is a specialty pick for genuinely rare, portable printing where avoiding ink maintenance matters more than print quality. For anything beyond occasional use, a standard inkjet from this list will serve better and cost less per page.",
