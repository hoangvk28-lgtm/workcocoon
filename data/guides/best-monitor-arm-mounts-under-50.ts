  "Under $50 usually means a workable monitor arm, not a flawless one. Expect a bit more friction in the gas spring's adjustment feel, more noticeable wobble once you're on a 27-inch-plus monitor, and faster sag over a few years than an $80-100 arm delivers. Some of the very cheapest options in this price band can fail within 6-12 months, so it's worth being upfront about that rather than pretending every budget arm performs the same.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your desk can actually grip the mounting base before comparing arms",
    "explanation": "A monitor arm's clamp or grommet base needs a solid desk edge to grip securely, and this is the real first question to answer before comparing gas spring tension or weight capacity, since a hollow honeycomb-core desktop, a glass top, or a desk under about an inch thick can rule out an entire category of arms regardless of how good the arm itself is.\n\nThis matters because discovering after purchase that your desk simply can't mount the arm you bought is a common and entirely avoidable problem.\n\nCheck your desk's actual edge thickness and construction (solid, hollow-core, or glass), and confirm the arm's clamp or grommet base is explicitly rated for that construction before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check real per-arm weight capacity, not the bundled-stand weight printed on the monitor box",
    "explanation": "Monitor weight ratings printed on the box often reference the monitor's included stand, not the bare panel weight relevant to a monitor arm, and a monitor arm's real weight capacity needs to match your specific monitor's actual panel weight without its stand, information usually found in the monitor's separate spec sheet rather than the box itself.\n\nThis matters directly for a larger or ultrawide monitor, where the gap between stand-inclusive and bare-panel weight can be substantial enough to matter.\n\nCheck your monitor's bare panel weight (without its stand) in its official spec sheet, and compare that specifically against the arm's rated capacity, not a generalized weight class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify VESA compatibility for both your monitor and the arm's mounting plate",
    "explanation": "VESA mounting patterns come in a few standard sizes (75x75mm and 100x100mm are most common), and a mismatch between your monitor's VESA pattern and the arm's mounting plate means the arm simply won't attach, some arms include an adapter for multiple patterns while others support only one.\n\nThis matters directly for a monitor with a non-standard or larger VESA pattern, particularly some ultrawide or curved monitors, where assuming universal compatibility can lead to an unusable purchase.\n\nCheck your monitor's specific VESA pattern in its spec sheet, and confirm the arm explicitly supports that pattern, either natively or with an included adapter, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand gas spring tension and how it affects long-term reliability",
    "explanation": "A gas spring monitor arm relies on an internal pressurized cylinder to hold the monitor at any height with minimal effort, and tension needs to be roughly matched to your monitor's actual weight, a monitor lighter than the spring's calibrated range can drift upward on its own, while pressure calibrated too low for a heavier monitor won't hold position and will slowly droop.\n\nThis matters for long-term usability, not just initial setup, since gas springs can also lose tension gradually over years of use.\n\nCheck the arm's rated weight range against your monitor's actual weight, favoring a monitor that falls comfortably within the middle of that range rather than at either extreme."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider reach and range of motion against your actual desk depth and seating position",
    "explanation": "An arm's horizontal reach and vertical range of motion determine how far the monitor can extend from the mounting point and how much height adjustment is available, and these dimensions matter differently depending on your desk depth and how far back you sit, a shallow desk needs less reach than a deep one, and a standing desk that changes height throughout the day needs a wider vertical range to stay at eye level.\n\nThis matters more for anyone switching between sitting and standing regularly, less for a fixed single seated position.\n\nCheck the arm's listed reach and height range against your actual desk depth and how much your seated or standing eye level varies throughout the day."

  {
    q: "Is a monitor arm under $50 actually good enough?",
    a: "For a 21-24 inch monitor in the 3-5kg range that you set once and rarely reposition, on a thick or solid desk, yes. Outside those conditions, expect more wobble on larger monitors, more adjustment friction, and faster sag over a few years than an $80-100 arm delivers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why would a budget arm wobble with a light monitor?",
    a: "A budget arm rated for up to 22 lbs can actually wobble excessively with a light 5-6 lb monitor because the spring tension is calibrated too high relative to that load. There's a sweet spot, roughly 4-8 lbs for most budget arms in this list, where the tension actually matches the monitor's weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can tightening a monitor arm clamp damage my desk?",
    a: "Yes, budget arms typically use a plastic thumbscrew with a steel jaw clamp, and overtightening it can dent a composite or hollow-core desktop common in flat-pack furniture. Tighten only until the arm stops shifting under light pressure, and use the grommet base option instead if your desk is hollow-core.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are all the picks in this guide actually under $50?",
    a: "Seven of the eight verified under $50 at the time of writing. One pick, the HUANUO FlowLift Dual Monitor Stand, verified at $59.99, above the $50 mark, and we've labeled it accordingly rather than mislabeling its real price.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is it worth spending more than $50 on a monitor arm?",
    a: "If your monitor exceeds 25 lbs or you reposition it frequently throughout the day, the extra $30-50 for an $80-100 tier arm buys a smoother, more durable mechanism and often a retightenable tension screw for long-term sag. If neither applies, a well-matched sub-$50 arm is a reasonable choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the cheapest genuinely reliable option in this list?",
    a: "The ErGear at $19.98 and the WALI at $19.99 are the two lowest-priced picks that still cover a reasonable monitor size and weight range. The WALI edges ahead on capacity at 26.4 lbs versus the ErGear's 19.8 lbs for essentially the same price.",
