export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The ASM2464PD Controller Chip Appears Across Most Budget Enclosures, Making Cooling Design the Real Differentiator",
    "explanation": "Three of the four picks in this comparison specifically use the same ASM2464PD controller chip, meaning the core data transfer technology is largely identical across these options, and the genuine differences in real-world performance come down to how each enclosure manages the heat that chip generates during sustained use. This matters because buyers often assume a higher price reflects a fundamentally different or better chip, when at this tier the price difference more often reflects cooling method, included accessories, or build quality rather than core transfer technology. Check whether a listing specifies its controller chip model, and if multiple picks share the same chip, focus your comparison on cooling design and accessories rather than assuming chip differences explain price gaps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Sustained Full-Speed Operation Time Reveals Real Thermal Performance Under Extended Use",
    "explanation": "The Rosewill pick's specific claim of supporting up to 4 hours of full-speed operation is a genuinely useful, checkable figure that most competing listings in this tier don't disclose, giving you a concrete expectation for how long you can transfer large files before potential thermal throttling begins to reduce speeds. This matters directly if you regularly perform large, sustained transfers like backing up extensive video libraries or working with multi-hour render exports, where thermal throttling partway through a transfer could meaningfully slow your workflow. Look for a specific sustained-operation time figure in a listing's cooling description, treating its absence as a signal to research real-world thermal performance through buyer feedback rather than assuming any enclosure handles extended heavy use equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Double-Sided SSD Incompatibility Is a Real, Specific Limitation That Can Disqualify Certain Popular SSD Models",
    "explanation": "The Cable Matters pick specifically states it does not support double-sided M.2 SSDs, explicitly naming popular models like the WD_BLACK SN850X and Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus as incompatible due to their physical component layout, a genuine hardware limitation rather than a minor inconvenience. This matters directly if you already own or plan to purchase one of these specifically incompatible double-sided SSD models, where this enclosure simply won't physically accommodate your drive regardless of its stated speed capabilities. Check your specific SSD model's physical design (single-sided versus double-sided component placement) against an enclosure's stated compatibility list before purchase, especially for higher-capacity SSDs which are more likely to use double-sided component layouts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included Dual-Cable Types Provide Real Value if You Need to Connect to Both Modern and Older Devices",
    "explanation": "The MOKiN pick specifically includes both a USB-C (USB4) cable and a USB-A cable in the box, meaning you can connect to modern Thunderbolt or USB4 devices at full speed, or fall back to a USB-A connection for older computers without USB-C ports, without needing to purchase a separate adapter or cable. This matters if you regularly need to connect the enclosure to a mix of newer and older devices, less so if all your intended devices already have USB-C ports where a single cable type suffices. Check whether a listing specifically states dual-cable inclusion if you anticipate needing to connect to older USB-A-only hardware alongside modern USB-C devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Stated Technical Support Period Signals Manufacturer Confidence at This Budget Price Point",
    "explanation": "The ANYOYO pick's specifically stated 24-month technical support commitment provides notably longer coverage than the typical support period found on many similarly budget-priced enclosures in this tier, a detail worth factoring into your purchase decision at the lowest price point in this comparison. This matters more if you're specifically drawn to the cheapest option and want some reassurance of manufacturer support if issues arise, since budget electronics can sometimes come with shorter or less responsive support commitments. Check the specific stated support duration in a listing's description rather than assuming all budget-tier enclosures offer equivalent post-purchase support coverage."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a Thunderbolt port specifically, or will these enclosures work with a standard USB-C port?", "a": "All four picks in this comparison work with both Thunderbolt 3/4 ports and standard USB4 or USB-C ports, though achieving the full 40Gbps speed specifically requires a Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 port and a compatible cable, while a standard USB-C port without USB4 support will still work but at reduced speeds." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between active and passive cooling enclosures at this tier?", "a": "Assuming passive cooling is always inferior, when for typical everyday use, like occasional file transfers or backups, passive cooling like the ANYOYO pick's design performs perfectly well and offers genuinely silent operation, with thermal throttling only becoming a concern during truly sustained, heavy workloads." },
  { "q": "Is the Rosewill pick worth it over the cheaper ANYOYO option?", "a": "If you specifically want a stated sustained full-speed operation endurance figure with active cooling, yes, but if you just want reliable passive cooling and silent operation at the lowest price, the ANYOYO pick covers that for about $24 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my specific SSD is double-sided and incompatible with the Cable Matters enclosure?", "a": "Check your SSD manufacturer's specification sheet for physical component layout details, or search for your exact SSD model number alongside 'double-sided' to confirm, since higher-capacity SSDs (typically 4TB and above) are more likely to use double-sided component placement that some enclosures can't accommodate." },
  { "q": "Can these budget enclosures achieve their full 40Gbps speed with any NVMe SSD I put inside them?", "a": "No, achieving the full stated speed also depends on your specific SSD's own maximum read/write speed rating, so pairing a budget enclosure with a slower or older NVMe SSD will result in transfer speeds limited by the SSD itself, not the enclosure's Thunderbolt interface." },
  { "q": "Do any of these enclosures require external power, or do they all run off the Thunderbolt/USB connection?", "a": "All four picks in this comparison are bus-powered, meaning they draw power directly from the Thunderbolt or USB connection without needing a separate power adapter, making them genuinely portable for use with laptops and other bus-powered devices." }
