export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Matching an Injector's Input Voltage to Your Existing Cabinet Supply Avoids Adding a Separate Power Run",
    "explanation": "Industrial DIN-rail injectors are specifically designed to accept the DC voltage already present in a control cabinet, like a common 12V or 24V rail, and boost it to a regulated 48V PoE output, meaning you avoid running new electrical wiring just to power the injector itself. This matters significantly for a retrofit installation into an existing cabinet where adding new wiring is costly or impractical, and matters less for a new installation where you're already planning the full electrical layout from scratch. Check your cabinet's actual existing DC voltage against a listing's stated input range before assuming any industrial injector will work with your current setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Power Ceiling You Actually Get Depends on Your Input Voltage, Not Just the Injector's Headline Wattage",
    "explanation": "Some industrial injectors, like the xoxnikior pick, explicitly state that their full rated wattage only applies at a specific input voltage (95W from 24V but only 60W from 12V), meaning the headline number on the box isn't automatically what you'll get if your cabinet supplies a lower voltage. This matters significantly for correctly sizing your device's power needs against what your specific cabinet voltage can actually deliver, and matters less if you're already running the highest voltage the injector supports. Check the listing's voltage-to-output mapping specifically rather than assuming the single highest advertised wattage number applies regardless of your actual input voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC Input Support on an Industrial Injector Removes a DC Conversion Step Some Cabinets Would Otherwise Need",
    "explanation": "Most industrial DIN-rail injectors in this comparison accept only DC input, but one listing specifically accepts 11-36V AC input directly, meaning a cabinet with AC power available but no existing DC conversion doesn't need a separate AC-to-DC converter before powering the injector. This matters if your specific cabinet's available power is AC rather than DC, and matters not at all if you already have a DC rail in place. Check whether your cabinet's actual available power is AC or DC before assuming any industrial injector accepts your specific power type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Two Independent PoE Ports in One Unit Save Real Panel Space Compared to Two Separate Single-Port Injectors",
    "explanation": "A 2-port DIN-rail injector occupies roughly the same compact footprint as a single-port unit while powering two separate devices, a meaningful space saving in a crowded control cabinet where DIN-rail real estate is limited. This matters significantly if your cabinet already has multiple other DIN-rail mounted components competing for the same limited rail space, and matters less if you have ample room and only need to power one device from that location. Count your available DIN-rail space alongside your device count when deciding between a 2-port unit and two separate single-port injectors."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA Compliance and Documented Industrial EMS Certifications Follow the Same Institutional Logic as Other PoE Tiers",
    "explanation": "Just as with standard indoor injectors, NDAA and TAA compliance at the industrial DIN-rail tier restricts sourcing for U.S. government and government-adjacent procurement, and documented EMS certifications like specific ESD and surge protection kV ratings give you a concrete, checkable comparison point rather than a vague overvoltage protection claim. This matters if you're specifying equipment for a government, utility, or critical-infrastructure installation where these requirements are explicitly mandated, and matters less for a private commercial or industrial installation with no such procurement policy. Check your project's specific procurement and certification requirements before paying extra for compliance you may not need."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I power an industrial DIN-rail PoE injector from a 12V cabinet supply?", "a": "Yes, several industrial injectors specifically accept 12V input and boost it to a regulated 48V PoE output, though check the specific wattage ceiling at 12V input since it's often lower than the unit's maximum rated output at a higher input voltage." },
  { "q": "Do I need NDAA compliance for a commercial industrial installation?", "a": "Only if your specific project has a government or government-adjacent procurement requirement; a private commercial or industrial installation typically has no such requirement and gains no functional benefit from paying extra for it." },
  { "q": "Is a 2-port DIN-rail injector better than two single-port units?", "a": "It saves panel space and installation complexity when you need to power two devices from the same cabinet location, though a single high-power port injector may offer a higher per-device wattage ceiling if you only need to power one device." },
  { "q": "What temperature range should an industrial PoE injector handle?", "a": "Most industrial-grade units in this comparison handle -40C to 75C or wider, suitable for unheated outdoor cabinets, roadside enclosures, and pump houses without additional climate control." },
  { "q": "Can an industrial PoE injector accept AC power instead of DC?", "a": "Most industrial DIN-rail injectors are DC-input only, but at least one listing in this comparison specifically accepts 11-36V AC input directly, removing the need for a separate AC-to-DC conversion step." },
  { "q": "What happens if my cabinet's voltage doesn't match the injector's stated maximum power voltage?", "a": "You'll typically still get PoE output, but potentially at a reduced maximum wattage than the injector's headline rating, since output capability at lower input voltages is usually reduced from the peak rating." }
