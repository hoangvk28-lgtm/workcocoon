export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Gasket-Mount Construction Uses Physical Foam Layers to Change Sound and Feel, Not Just a Marketing Term",
    "explanation": "A gasket-mounted keyboard, like the Kisnt and HUO JI picks, suspends the internal plate between layers of foam and silicone rather than screwing it directly to a rigid case, which absorbs vibration and produces a deeper, more muted 'thock' sound instead of a hollow, echoey 'clack'. This matters concretely if you type or game in a shared space where keyboard noise could be disruptive, or if you simply prefer a softer, more cushioned keystroke feel over a stiffer, more rigid one. Check the listing specifically for the words 'gasket' or 'gasket-mounted' alongside a description of foam layers, since 'sound dampening' alone without gasket-mount construction typically produces a smaller improvement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tri-Mode Wireless Connectivity Lets You Switch Between Devices Without Re-Pairing, a Real Convenience Beyond Just 'Wireless'",
    "explanation": "The Kisnt KN85's tri-mode connectivity, covering USB-C wired, 2.4GHz wireless, and Bluetooth across 3 channels, means you can maintain separate paired connections to a work laptop, a personal computer, and a tablet simultaneously, switching between them with a shortcut rather than re-pairing each time you change devices. This matters if you regularly work across multiple devices in the same session, less so if you only ever connect to one computer permanently. Check whether a 'wireless' keyboard supports multiple simultaneous device pairings with quick switching, or just a single Bluetooth connection, before assuming all wireless keyboards offer the same multi-device flexibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Keystroke Lifespan Figure Is a Concrete, Checkable Durability Claim Worth Comparing When Available",
    "explanation": "The Keychron C2's switches are specifically rated for up to 50 million keystrokes, a concrete manufacturer durability claim that gives you a checkable baseline for expected switch lifespan, unlike a listing that simply says 'durable' or 'long-lasting' without a specific number. This matters more if you're a heavy daily typist putting the keyboard through extensive use over years, and matters less for occasional or light use where you're unlikely to approach any reasonable switch's rated lifespan regardless of the specific figure. Look for a specific keystroke count figure in the listing's switch description if long-term durability under heavy daily use is a priority for your purchase."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hot-Swappable Support Requires Checking Pin Compatibility, Not Just the Presence of the Feature Itself",
    "explanation": "Both the Kisnt and HUO JI picks specifically support both 3-pin and 5-pin switch replacements, a broader compatibility than some hot-swap boards that only accept one pin type, meaning you have more switch options available if you later want to experiment with different feels. This matters if you're buying with the intention of eventually customizing your switches, where a board limited to one pin type restricts your future upgrade options more than one supporting both common types. Check the listing specifically for '3-pin and 5-pin' compatibility language rather than assuming any 'hot-swappable' claim supports the full range of switches available on the market."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Windows-Only Software for Remapping Is a Real Limitation for Mac-Primary Users Despite Cross-Platform Typing Compatibility",
    "explanation": "The Kisnt KN85's driver software for key remapping and macro editing is specifically Windows-only, meaning a Mac user can still type normally on the keyboard but cannot access the remapping or macro customization features without a Windows machine available, a distinction from the Keychron C2's built-in Mac-optimized layout that works natively without needing separate software at all. This matters if you're a Mac-primary user specifically interested in the remapping or macro features rather than just basic typing functionality. Check whether a keyboard's advanced customization features require platform-specific software before assuming full functionality across both Mac and Windows."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does gasket-mount construction make a real audible difference, or is it mostly marketing?", "a": "It makes a genuine, noticeable difference in both sound and feel since the internal plate is physically decoupled from the rigid case by foam and silicone layers, producing a measurably deeper and quieter sound than a standard screwed-in plate design." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a wireless mechanical keyboard at this tier?", "a": "Assuming all 'wireless' keyboards support the same multi-device switching convenience, when some only support a single Bluetooth pairing at a time, so checking for tri-mode or multi-channel support like on the Kisnt KN85 matters if you switch between devices often." },
  { "q": "Is the Kisnt KN85 worth it over the cheaper HUO JI E-Yooso option?", "a": "If you specifically need true wireless connectivity across multiple devices, yes, but if you're fine with a wired connection and want the same gasket-mount sound quality for less, the HUO JI pick covers that for about $5 less." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Keychron C2's Mac-optimized layout on a Windows PC without issues?", "a": "Yes, it's designed to be compatible with Windows despite its Mac-optimized layout, and it includes extra keycaps for Windows so you can swap the Mac-specific keys like the Siri key to their Windows equivalents." },
  { "q": "Do the hot-swappable keyboards in this comparison require any special tools to change switches?", "a": "No, both the Kisnt and HUO JI picks are designed for tool-free switch replacement, using their hot-swap PCB design to let you pull and replace switches by hand without soldering." },
  { "q": "How long does the Kisnt KN85's battery actually last on wireless mode with RGB lighting on?", "a": "Using animated RGB effects drains the battery faster than static lighting, so the listing specifically recommends static effects or dimming the lights during long sessions if you want to maximize battery life between the roughly 7-8 hour charges." }
