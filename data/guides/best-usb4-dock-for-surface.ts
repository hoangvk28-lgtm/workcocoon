export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Official Microsoft Docks and Third-Party Docks Use Genuinely Different Underlying Connection Standards",
    "explanation": "The Microsoft Surface Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station uses genuine Thunderbolt 4 technology, while the Microsoft Surface USB4 Dock for Business specifically uses a USB4 host interface with a stated 5 GB/s maximum transfer rate, a meaningfully lower ceiling than Thunderbolt 4's typical 40Gbps capability despite both being official Microsoft products. This matters if you need maximum data transfer speed for large file transfers or external SSDs, where the Thunderbolt 4 dock's higher bandwidth ceiling matters more, and matters less if you primarily use the dock for basic charging, networking, and a single display. Check whether a Surface dock specifically states Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 as its underlying standard, since these two official Microsoft products differ meaningfully in raw bandwidth despite similar branding."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Third-Party Docks Precision-Engineered for Surface Hardware Solve Compatibility Quirks Generic USB-C Docks Can Miss",
    "explanation": "Surface devices have historically had specific quirks around external display detection and power negotiation that a generic USB-C dock not designed with Surface hardware in mind can struggle with, while both third-party picks in this comparison specifically state they're engineered for a named list of Surface Pro, Laptop, Go, and Book models. This matters if you're choosing between a Surface-specific dock and a generic universal USB-C dock at a similar price, where the Surface-specific engineering reduces the risk of display or charging issues. Look for a dock that specifically lists your exact Surface model in its stated compatibility list rather than assuming any USB-C dock will work identically with Surface hardware."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A VGA Port Is a Genuinely Useful Legacy Compatibility Feature If You Still Use Older Display Hardware",
    "explanation": "The 12-in-1 pick specifically includes a VGA port alongside its dual 4K HDMI outputs, letting you connect an older monitor, projector, or conference room display that only accepts VGA input without needing a separate adapter, a feature the other three picks in this comparison don't offer. This matters if you regularly present in older conference rooms or classrooms still equipped with VGA-only projectors, and matters less if all your displays are modern HDMI or DisplayPort equipped. Check whether legacy VGA support is specifically needed for your regular presentation or display environments before assuming every modern dock covers this connection type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "SD/TF Card Slot Read Speed Is a Specific, Checkable Number Worth Comparing for Media Workflows",
    "explanation": "The Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock 13-in-1 specifically states its SD/TF card slots support speeds up to 104MB/s, a concrete figure that directly affects how long it takes to offload photos and video from a camera's memory card, unlike a dock that simply states 'card reader included' without disclosing an actual speed rating. This matters significantly if you're a photographer or videographer who regularly offloads large media files, and matters less if you rarely or never use the dock's card slot. Check for a specifically stated card reader speed in MB/s before assuming any dock's integrated card slot will offload your media files quickly."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length Differences Among Similarly Priced Third-Party Surface Docks Are Worth Comparing Directly",
    "explanation": "The Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock 13-in-1 specifically states a 24-month warranty, twice the 12-month coverage stated for the similarly priced 12-in-1 pick, a meaningful difference in manufacturer confidence and buyer protection between two products at nearly the same price point. This matters if you're deciding between two similarly featured and priced third-party docks, where longer warranty coverage provides more assurance against defects, and matters less if you plan to replace the dock within a year or two regardless. Compare the specifically stated warranty length between similarly priced third-party options rather than assuming all third-party Surface docks carry equivalent coverage."

  { "q": "How do I know if my Surface device supports triple external displays through one of these docks?", "a": "Checking your specific Surface model's official display output specifications against the dock's stated display support is worth doing, since some Surface models are limited to fewer simultaneous external displays regardless of how many the dock itself supports." },
