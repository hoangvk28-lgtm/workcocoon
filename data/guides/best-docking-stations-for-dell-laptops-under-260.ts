export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Decide if a first-party Dell dock or a third-party Dell-compatible dock fits your situation",
    explanation: "A genuine Dell-branded dock, like the WD22TB4, comes with Dell's own hardware validation, warranty terms, and support path that ties directly into Dell's broader customer service and IT procurement systems, which matters most in a managed fleet environment where consistent vendor support simplifies asset tracking. A third-party dock explicitly marketed as Dell-compatible can offer more ports or features for a lower price, but any support or warranty claim comes from that third-party brand rather than Dell itself. For a personal home office setup, either path is reasonable; for an IT-managed environment, a first-party Dell dock is generally the simpler procurement choice."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Compare stated warranty length directly, since it can vary between nearly identical listings",
    explanation: "We found two Dell-branded WD22TB4 listings with essentially identical hardware specs, same charging wattage and same Thunderbolt 4 certification, that differ mainly in their stated warranty term, one offering 1 year and the other 3 years for only a modest price difference. This is a genuine example of where reading the specific warranty language in a listing directly, rather than assuming a standard warranty term across similarly priced products, can meaningfully change the value calculation. Always check the exact stated warranty period in the listing's description, since it isn't always reflected proportionally in the price."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Confirm Thunderbolt certification if you need guaranteed high-bandwidth multi-display support",
    explanation: "Genuine Thunderbolt 4 certification, found on the Dell-branded picks in this comparison, guarantees a specific minimum bandwidth ceiling (40Gbps) for connecting multiple displays and peripherals simultaneously, a guarantee a standard USB-C dock without that certification doesn't carry in the same documented way. For most standard office use, single or dual-display setups with typical peripherals, a well-specified USB-C dock performs comparably in practice. If you specifically need to run triple 4K displays with heavy simultaneous peripheral use, prioritizing Thunderbolt-certified hardware reduces the risk of hitting an undocumented bandwidth limitation."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match charging wattage to your specific Dell laptop model's power needs",
    explanation: "Dell's laptop lineup spans from lightweight ultrabooks that charge comfortably at 65-100W up to workstation-class models that draw significantly more power, and the docks in this comparison range from 100W up to 180W of charging capability accordingly. A dock rated below your laptop's actual power draw under load will still charge it, but potentially more slowly than its included charger, or in extreme cases not fast enough to keep up with battery drain during heavy use. Check your specific Dell laptop model's power adapter rating (typically printed on the charger brick) and match it against the dock's stated maximum charging wattage before assuming any dock in this price range covers your model."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Verify included accessories match what you'll actually need for setup",
    explanation: "Some listings in this comparison explicitly state included HDMI and DisplayPort cables plus a cleaning cloth, while others describe the dock itself without detailing what cables ship in the box, which affects your real total setup cost if you need to separately purchase display cables. This is a small but real cost difference between otherwise similarly priced docks: a listing that bundles the cables you need saves you a separate purchase and shipping wait, while one that doesn't requires sourcing compatible cables yourself. Check the listing's \"what's included\" section specifically rather than assuming all docks in a similar price range include the same accessories."

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Should I buy a genuine Dell dock or a third-party dock that claims Dell compatibility?",
    a: "For an IT-managed fleet, a first-party Dell dock simplifies warranty and procurement since it comes from the same vendor as the laptops. For a personal home office setup, a well-reviewed third-party dock like Anker's picks in this comparison can offer more ports or features for less money, without Dell's own support channel."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do two nearly identical Dell WD22TB4 listings have different warranty terms?",
    a: "Different retailers or listing configurations sometimes bundle different warranty terms for otherwise similar hardware, which is why checking the exact stated warranty in each specific listing matters rather than assuming a standard term across similarly priced Dell docks."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need Thunderbolt certification for a standard dual-monitor office setup?",
    a: "Not necessarily. A well-specified USB-C dock without Thunderbolt certification can handle typical dual-display office setups comfortably. Thunderbolt certification matters most if you're running triple high-resolution displays with heavy simultaneous peripheral use where guaranteed bandwidth becomes more important."
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 130W dock charge my Dell laptop as fast as its original charger?",
    a: "It depends on your specific Dell model's power needs. If your laptop's included charger is rated at or below 130W, a 130W dock should charge it comparably. If your laptop draws more power than that under load, a higher-wattage dock like the 180W options in this comparison is the safer match."
  },
  {
    q: "Do these docks come with the cables I need for my monitors?",
    a: "It varies by listing. Some explicitly state included HDMI and DisplayPort cables, while others don't detail this in their description. Check the specific listing's included-items section before assuming cables are bundled, since you may need to purchase them separately otherwise."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a Dell-branded dock with a non-Dell laptop?",
    a: "Genuine Dell Thunderbolt docks generally work with any laptop that has a compatible Thunderbolt or USB-C port, not exclusively Dell hardware, though Dell markets and validates them primarily for its own laptop lineup. Check the dock's stated port and protocol compatibility against your specific non-Dell laptop's ports before assuming full compatibility."
