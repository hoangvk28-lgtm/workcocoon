export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Confirm the output voltage matches your router's power brick exactly",
    explanation: "Most home routers and modems run on 12V, 9V, or 5V DC power, and that voltage is printed directly on the original power adapter's label, usually as something like \"Output: 12V 1A.\" A mini UPS that only outputs 9V won't properly power a router that expects 12V, even if the physical connector plug happens to fit, since running equipment on the wrong voltage can either fail to power it or damage it over time. Before buying, check your router's power brick for its exact output voltage and confirm the UPS you're considering lists that same voltage among its outputs, not just a general \"multiple voltage\" claim."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Compare capacity in watt-hours, not just the mAh number on the box",
    explanation: "Milliamp-hour (mAh) figures are only directly comparable between batteries of the same voltage, so a 10400mAh battery built around a different internal cell voltage than a 13500mAh competitor might actually store a similar or even greater amount of real energy, measured in watt-hours (Wh). Some listings state the Wh figure directly alongside the mAh number, which is the more useful figure for comparing real capacity across different products. When a listing only gives mAh with no Wh figure, treat the comparison as rough rather than exact, and prioritize listings that state both numbers."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check for a stated runtime figure at a specific load",
    explanation: "A battery's actual runtime depends on how much power your specific router draws, which varies by router model, so a raw capacity number alone doesn't tell you how long your router will actually stay online during an outage. A few listings solve this by stating an actual runtime figure, such as \"provides up to 5 hours of continuous operation,\" which is a directly checkable claim rather than a number you'd need to calculate yourself from your router's wattage. If a listing doesn't state a runtime figure, check your router's power label for its wattage and do a rough mental estimate (watt-hours divided by router wattage) before assuming a larger mAh number automatically means longer runtime."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Verify the physical DC connector size fits your router's power cable",
    explanation: "Even when the voltage matches, DC power connectors come in different physical barrel sizes, and a mini UPS with the wrong barrel size for your router's power cable won't make a working connection regardless of matching voltage. Some listings note a standard 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel size, which is common but not universal across all router and modem brands. Check your router's existing power adapter for its connector size (often printed near the barrel plug or in the router's manual) and compare it against the UPS listing's stated connector size before assuming any DC output will physically connect."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Look for basic safety protections as a baseline, not a premium feature",
    explanation: "Because these units sit between wall power and networking equipment continuously, basic protection circuits, short-circuit protection, overcharge protection, and over-discharge protection, prevent a battery fault from damaging your router or the UPS itself. These protections are inexpensive for manufacturers to include and should be treated as a baseline requirement rather than a premium upsell, since their absence is a real risk indicator rather than just a missing nice-to-have. Every pick in this comparison lists these protections, so use their presence as a pass/fail check when considering any mini UPS not covered here rather than assuming it's standard across the whole category."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Will any mini UPS work with my router, or do I need to match the voltage exactly?",
    a: "You need to match the voltage. Check your router's original power adapter for its exact output voltage (usually printed as something like \"Output: 12V\"), and confirm the mini UPS you're buying lists that same voltage among its outputs. A mismatch can fail to power the router or potentially damage it."
  },
  {
    q: "How long will these units actually keep my router running during an outage?",
    a: "It depends on your router's specific power draw and the UPS's capacity. A few listings state an actual runtime figure (such as 5 hours) which is the most direct answer; for others, check your router's wattage label and compare it against the UPS's stated watt-hour capacity for a rough estimate."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a bigger mAh number always a better mini UPS?",
    a: "Not necessarily. mAh figures are only directly comparable between batteries built around the same internal voltage, so watt-hours (Wh) is the more reliable number when a listing provides it. A stated runtime figure at a specific load is even more useful than either number alone."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use one of these to power something other than a router, like a security camera?",
    a: "Yes, most mini UPS units in this category list compatibility with routers, modems, security cameras, and similar small DC-powered devices, since they all use standard 5V, 9V, or 12V power. Just confirm the specific device's voltage and connector size match before connecting it."
  },
  {
    q: "Do these units also work as a regular phone charger or power bank?",
    a: "Several picks in this comparison include a standard USB output and can double as a basic phone power bank when they're not actively backing up a router. Check the specific listing's USB output rating (typically 5V/2A) to confirm it'll charge your phone at a reasonable speed."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to my router the moment the power goes out?",
    a: "A properly matched mini UPS switches to battery power automatically and near-instantly, so your router should stay online through the transition without needing to restart. If your specific router does briefly drop connection during a power event, check whether the UPS's transfer time is stated in its listing."
