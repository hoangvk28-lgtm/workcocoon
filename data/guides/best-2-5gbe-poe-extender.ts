export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 90W PoE++ Total Input Consistently Splits Down to a 30W Maximum Per Output Port Across This Category",
    "explanation": "Every pick in this comparison specifically states a 90W PoE++ input that splits into a 30W maximum PoE+ output per port, a consistent pattern across brands that reveals the real per-device power ceiling regardless of the impressive-sounding 90W input figure on the box. This matters significantly if you're connecting a device that specifically requires more than 30W, since none of these 2.5GbE extenders in this comparison would adequately power it despite their high total input rating. Check a 2.5GbE extender's per-port output figure, not just its total input wattage, before assuming a high input rating means each connected device receives that same high wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "2.5GbE Speed Only Provides Real Benefit if Your Connected Device Can Actually Use More Than Gigabit Bandwidth",
    "explanation": "All four picks specifically support 100/1000/2500Mbps adaptive speed, genuinely useful for newer WiFi 6E or WiFi 7 access points and multi-gig NAS devices that can exceed standard Gigabit throughput, but providing no practical benefit for a standard IP camera or basic access point that tops out well under 1Gbps anyway. This matters if you're specifically deploying multi-gig-capable equipment that benefits from the extra bandwidth headroom, and matters much less for standard PoE devices where a cheaper Gigabit-only extender would perform identically in practice. Verify your specific connected device's actual maximum throughput capability before paying a premium for 2.5GbE support it may never utilize."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IP55 Waterproofing Is a Meaningfully Lower Water Resistance Standard Than IP66 or IP67 Ratings Seen Elsewhere",
    "explanation": "The outdoor-rated picks in this comparison specifically state IP55 protection, which guards against low-pressure water jets from any direction but offers less protection than the IP66 or IP67 ratings found on some standard Gigabit PoE extenders covered elsewhere, reflecting that 2.5GbE outdoor technology is still catching up to the waterproofing standards of the more mature Gigabit extender market. This matters if your installation faces genuinely heavy rain or potential water pooling, where an IP55 rating provides less assurance than a higher-rated alternative, and matters less for a moderately sheltered outdoor location. Check the specific IP rating number on any 2.5GbE outdoor extender and compare it against your installation's real water exposure risk, rather than assuming 'waterproof' claims are equivalent across different rated products."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DIN-Rail Mounting Compatibility Serves a Genuinely Different Installation Context Than Outdoor Wall Mounting",
    "explanation": "The DIN-rail picks in this comparison specifically target indoor control cabinet and industrial panel installations, a different physical mounting context than the outdoor wall-mount-oriented picks, even though both categories share identical core 2.5Gbps and wattage specifications. This matters if your specific installation involves a standardized industrial control cabinet with DIN-rail infrastructure already in place, and matters less for a simple wall-mounted outdoor camera installation. Match an extender's mounting format to your actual installation infrastructure rather than assuming any 2.5GbE extender's physical mounting style fits your specific deployment context."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Optional VLAN Toggle Provides More Flexibility Than an Always-On Isolation Feature for Varying Deployment Needs",
    "explanation": "The Ztyuav picks specifically include a dipswitch-controlled VLAN mode that can be enabled or disabled as needed, while the YuanLey picks apply VLAN isolation as a standard always-on feature, a real difference in flexibility for buyers whose network security needs vary between different installations using the same extender model. This matters if you deploy the same extender model across multiple sites with different security requirements, and matters less if you have a consistent VLAN isolation need across every installation. Check whether a 2.5GbE extender's VLAN feature is toggleable or fixed if deployment flexibility across varying security needs matters for your use case."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a 2.5GbE PoE extender, or is standard Gigabit enough?", "a": "Standard Gigabit is sufficient for most IP cameras and access points, so a 2.5GbE extender is specifically worth the investment only if you're deploying WiFi 6E, WiFi 7, or other multi-gig-capable equipment that can actually exceed 1Gbps throughput." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 2.5GbE PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming the impressive 90W total input figure means each connected device receives that much power, when every pick in this comparison specifically caps per-port output at 30W regardless of the higher total input rating." },
  { "q": "Is the YuanLey Outdoor extender worth the higher price over the Ztyuav DIN-Rail pick?", "a": "If you specifically need genuine IP55 outdoor waterproofing with always-on VLAN isolation, the YuanLey's higher price is justified, but for an indoor deployment without those specific needs, the Ztyuav DIN-Rail pick delivers the same core 2.5Gbps performance for less." },
  { "q": "Can I mount these 2.5GbE extenders in a standard industrial control cabinet?", "a": "The two DIN-Rail-labeled picks in this comparison specifically support DIN-rail mounting for control cabinet installations, while the outdoor-focused picks are designed primarily for wall mounting instead." },
  { "q": "Will a 2.5GbE extender actually make my WiFi 6E access point faster?", "a": "Only if your access point's actual wireless throughput exceeds standard Gigabit speeds under real conditions, since the extender's 2.5Gbps capability only provides a benefit when the connected device can genuinely utilize bandwidth beyond 1Gbps." },
  { "q": "Is IP55 waterproofing good enough for a fully exposed outdoor camera installation?", "a": "IP55 provides protection against low-pressure water jets but is a lower standard than IP66 or IP67 ratings, so for a fully exposed installation facing heavy rain or potential water pooling, you may want to consider additional weather protection beyond the extender's own rating." }
