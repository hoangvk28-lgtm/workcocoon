An anti-collision sensor stops the lift automatically if it meets resistance while raising.\n\nBuilt specifically to fit a 49\" ultrawide plus a second screen.

    q: "Will a 34\" or 49\" ultrawide look sharper?",
    a: "Not really. Both a 3440x1440 34\" panel and a 5120x1440 49\" panel land around 108-110 PPI, so text sharpness feels about the same at either size. The real difference between them is desk depth and desk space required, not image sharpness.",
  },
  {
    q: "What wattage docking station do I need for my laptop?",
    a: "65W USB-C Power Delivery is enough for most ultrabooks, but a 16\" MacBook Pro or similar high-draw laptop needs 90W or more to charge at full speed while driving external displays. The LIONWEI 13-in-1 dock's 100W PD covers both cases comfortably.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run two monitors from one docking station with an ultrawide?",
    a: "Yes, if the dock has enough video outputs. The LIONWEI 13-in-1 includes 2 HDMI 4K outputs plus 1 DisplayPort, enough to drive an ultrawide plus a second screen from a single USB-C cable to the laptop.",
