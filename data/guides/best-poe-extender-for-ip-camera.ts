export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A PoE Extender's Real Bandwidth Often Drops Well Before Its Advertised Maximum Distance",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically discloses that its paired-mode bandwidth drops to just 10Mbps once past 1960ft, even though its maximum stated distance is 2600ft, a real and substantial speed reduction that occurs before the extender reaches its full advertised range. This matters significantly if you're running a high-resolution camera that needs consistent bandwidth at the far end of a long cable run, and matters less if your camera only needs a modest, low-bitrate connection. Check a listing specifically for bandwidth figures at different distance milestones, not just its single best-case maximum distance number, before assuming full speed holds throughout the entire advertised range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Reusing Existing Coaxial Cable Can Avoid a Costly Rewiring Project When Upgrading an Analog CCTV System",
    "explanation": "The PoE Over Coax Converter pick specifically lets you reuse existing RG59, RG6, or RG11 coaxial cable already installed for an older analog CCTV system, converting it to carry both PoE power and IP data without pulling new cable runs. This matters significantly if you're upgrading a building with existing coax infrastructure, since rewiring can be expensive or physically impractical in settings like elevator shafts or finished walls, and matters less if you're installing a fresh system with no existing cabling to reuse. Check whether an extender specifically supports coax reuse if avoiding a rewiring project is a real cost consideration for your upgrade."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A PoE Combiner Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than a Straight-Line Distance Extender",
    "explanation": "The IPCamPower pick is specifically designed to run two nearby cameras over a single cable back to the switch, a fundamentally different use case from extending PoE distance to one single far-away camera, even though both product types get grouped under the general 'PoE extender' category. This matters if your actual installation has two cameras mounted near each other but far from your switch or NVR, where a combiner saves real cabling cost, and matters much less if you only have one camera per location that simply needs more distance. Identify whether your actual installation problem is distance to one device or combining multiple nearby devices onto one cable run before choosing between these genuinely different product types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Extender's Explicit 24V PoE Exclusion Can Cause a Real Compatibility Failure With Certain Cameras",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit PoE+ Extender pick specifically states it does not support 24V PoE devices, only standard IEEE 802.3af/at, a real and specific exclusion that matters if your particular camera or IP phone uses the less common 24V passive PoE standard rather than the more prevalent 802.3af/at active PoE standard. This matters significantly if you're not certain which PoE standard your existing camera uses, since connecting an unsupported 24V device to an 802.3af/at-only extender may simply not power the device at all. Verify your camera's exact PoE standard (802.3af, 802.3at, or 24V passive) against an extender's explicitly stated compatibility before purchasing, rather than assuming all PoE devices work with any PoE extender."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Operating Temperature Range Matters as Much as a Waterproof Rating for a Genuinely Harsh Outdoor Installation",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit PoE+ Extender pick specifically states an operating range of -40F to 158F, a notably wider tolerance than a typical -10C to 50C range seen on some other outdoor-rated extenders, which matters in climates with genuine temperature extremes beyond what a standard outdoor rating anticipates. This matters if you're installing in a region with very cold winters or very hot summers where electronics could be pushed outside a more modest temperature range, and matters less in a moderate climate where any outdoor-rated unit would perform adequately. Check an extender's specific operating temperature range, not just its IP waterproof rating, if your installation location experiences genuine temperature extremes."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a PoE extender's full bandwidth hold up at its maximum advertised distance?", "a": "Not always; the LINOVISION pick specifically discloses that bandwidth drops to 10Mbps well before its full 2600ft maximum distance, so checking a listing's bandwidth-by-distance breakdown rather than just its headline maximum range is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a PoE extender for an IP camera?", "a": "Assuming any PoE extender works with any PoE camera, when some extenders explicitly exclude 24V PoE devices and only support the more common IEEE 802.3af/at standard, which can cause a real compatibility failure if your camera uses a different standard." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION long-distance extender worth it over the Gigabit extender if my camera doesn't need full speed?", "a": "If your camera only needs modest bandwidth and you need to reach an extreme distance, the LINOVISION's extended reach is the better fit, but if your camera needs consistent full bitrate, the Gigabit extender's shorter range with maintained speed is the better choice." },
  { "q": "Can I use the coax converter to upgrade my analog security system without pulling new cable?", "a": "Yes, the PoE Over Coax Converter is specifically designed to reuse existing RG59, RG6, or RG11 coaxial cable from an analog CCTV system, letting you upgrade to IP networking without a full rewiring project." },
  { "q": "Do I need a combiner or an extender if I have two cameras mounted close together but far from my switch?", "a": "A combiner like the IPCamPower pick is specifically designed for that scenario, letting you run one cable to both nearby cameras rather than extending distance separately to each one with two individual extenders." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my camera uses 24V PoE or the standard 802.3af/at PoE?", "a": "Checking your camera's own product documentation or power specification label for the exact PoE standard it requires, and matching that against an extender's explicitly stated compatibility, is the reliable way to confirm before buying an extender that specifically excludes 24V devices." }
