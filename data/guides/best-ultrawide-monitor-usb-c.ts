    q: "What does USB-C Power Delivery actually do on an ultrawide monitor?",
    a: "USB-C with Power Delivery lets a single cable carry video, charge your laptop, and pass data all at once, replacing a separate power brick, video cable, and USB hub. The picks in this list range from 65W to 95W of Power Delivery, and the right wattage depends on how power-hungry your specific laptop is.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 65W USB-C Power Delivery enough to charge my laptop?",
    a: "For most thin-and-light ultrabooks, yes, 65W is sufficient to fully charge while in use, which is what the LG 34WR55QK-B, Dell S3425DW, and Philips 34E1C5600HE in this list offer. A power-hungry 16\" workstation laptop under heavy load may only slow-charge on 65W, in which case the 90W Samsung or Dell U4924DW, or the 95W Philips 346B1C, are safer choices.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a 34\" or 49\" ultrawide monitor with USB-C?",
    a: "A 34\" panel is comfortable at roughly 24-31 inches viewing distance and needs about 24-28 inches of usable desk depth, while a 49\" super-ultrawide like the Dell UltraSharp U4924DW feels best around 35-39 inches away and needs 28-30+ inches of desk depth. Pixel density is nearly identical between the two, so the real decision comes down to desk space and how much head rotation you're comfortable with across a full workday.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which monitor in this list is best for running two computers?",
    a: "The Philips 346B1C and the Dell UltraSharp U4924DW are the only picks in this list with a built-in KVM switch, letting one keyboard and mouse control two separate machines without extra hardware. If you only use one computer, this feature adds cost without a payoff.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need Thunderbolt 4 for a USB-C ultrawide monitor?",
    a: "Only if your laptop supports Thunderbolt 4 and you need its higher bandwidth for things like daisy-chaining devices or driving very high refresh rates. The Dell UltraSharp U3425WE is the only pick in this list with Thunderbolt 4; every other pick uses standard USB-C, which is sufficient for basic video, charging, and data on most setups.",
