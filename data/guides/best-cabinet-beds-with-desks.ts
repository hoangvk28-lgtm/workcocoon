  "A cabinet bed with a desk is meant to do two jobs at once, hide a bed inside a cabinet during the day and hand you a fold-down work surface for the hours you're not sleeping. Not every listing marketed in this space actually says so, even when it's positioned as a home office solution. We checked all 8 listings below and only 4 explicitly confirm a fold-down or built-in desk in the title or bullet points.",
  "This guide separates those two groups clearly rather than blurring them together. Four picks have a confirmed desk feature stated on the listing, and four are murphy beds with storage drawers and charging stations but no stated desk or work surface, useful if you want the space-saving cabinet format without paying for a desk you won't use. Ratings and review counts below are quoted exactly as listed on Amazon, and several of these are new or lightly reviewed listings with as few as 1 to 4 ratings, which is disclosed honestly pick by pick rather than glossed over.",

  {
    q: "Do all 8 cabinet beds in this guide actually have a desk?",
    a: "No. Only 4 do: the Merax, Softa, KEIKI, and MERITLINE picks each state a fold-down desk or work surface directly on the listing. The two LUXOAK listings and two AMERLIFE listings focus on storage drawers and charging stations, with no desk or work surface mentioned, so treat those 4 as storage-focused murphy beds rather than desk beds.",
  },
  {
    q: "How deep is the desk on a cabinet bed?",
    a: "Where a desk is included, it's typically only 10 to 14 inches deep, enough for a laptop but not a full monitor-and-keyboard setup. If you need more desk depth, plan to supplement with a separate small desk for daytime work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 6-inch tri-fold mattress good enough for nightly sleeping?",
    a: "It's noticeably less supportive than a standard 10 to 12 inch murphy mattress, so it works fine for occasional guest use but isn't ideal as a primary nightly mattress beyond a few months. If you plan to sleep on it regularly, consider a thicker mattress within the unit's stated weight range.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much floor space does a queen cabinet bed need?",
    a: "About 80 to 90 inches of clear floor space once unfolded, meaning you need roughly 7 feet or more of permanently open floor in front of the unit. Measure your room before buying since this space generally can't be worked around with furniture placement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a heavier or lighter mattress than the one included?",
    a: "Not safely without checking the stated weight range first. The fold spring or gas strut mechanism is pre-calibrated for a specific mattress weight, and going outside that range can make the mechanism too stiff or too loose to operate reliably.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why are two of the picks in this guide nearly identical AMERLIFE listings?",
    a: "They're separate Amazon listings for what appears to be the same core product, at slightly different prices. We included both because pricing and stock availability can shift between duplicate listings from the same seller, so it's worth comparing both before ordering.",
