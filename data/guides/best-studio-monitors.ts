  {
    "criterion": "Near-Field Placement and Listening Distance",
    "explanation": "Near-field monitors are designed to be heard directly from the speaker rather than reflected off your room's walls, floor, and ceiling, which matters because most home studios lack the acoustic treatment to control those reflections cleanly. This is why nearly every home studio monitor, including every pick in this comparison, is a near-field design tuned for listening roughly 3 to 4 feet away rather than the 8-plus feet a mid-field studio monitor expects. Check the manufacturer's recommended listening distance in the spec sheet and compare it to your actual desk setup before assuming any monitor will sound balanced at your specific seating position."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Speaker Size vs Room Size",
    "explanation": "Woofer size, most commonly 5 or 8 inches for home studios, directly affects how much low-frequency detail a monitor can reproduce and how much bass builds up in a small, untreated room. A 5-inch woofer is the standard, safer choice for a bedroom or small desk setup, since a larger 8-inch woofer can overload a small room with bass reflections that make mixing decisions less reliable, not more accurate. Check the specific woofer diameter listed in the spec sheet and match it to your room's actual square footage rather than assuming bigger always means better."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wattage and Real Headroom",
    "explanation": "Wattage describes how loud a monitor can play before the amplifier starts distorting, and for most home studio use 50 to 75 watts per channel is genuinely sufficient, since mixing at reasonable volume rarely demands more. Buyers sometimes assume more wattage always sounds better, but excess headroom mostly matters in larger rooms or louder monitoring situations, not for a typical desk setup a few feet from your ears. Check the per-channel wattage figure specifically, not a combined system total, since some listings quote the sum of both speakers as one inflated number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Equilateral Triangle Placement",
    "explanation": "Correct stereo imaging depends on positioning your pair of monitors so they, along with your listening position, form an equilateral triangle, meaning the distance between the two speakers equals the distance from each speaker to your head. Placing monitors too close together or too far apart distorts the stereo image regardless of how good the monitors themselves are, which is a setup detail entirely independent of which model you buy. Before blaming a monitor for a weak stereo image, measure your actual desk layout against this triangle rule first."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Powered vs Passive Design",
    "explanation": "A powered (active) studio monitor has its amplifier built directly into the cabinet, so it only needs a line-level source cable to work, while a passive monitor requires a separate external power amplifier matched to its impedance and wattage rating. Nearly every home studio buyer should choose powered monitors, since they're simpler to set up, avoid amp-matching mistakes, and are what nearly every current monitor on the market, including every pick in this comparison, is built as. Check the listing specifically for the word 'powered' or 'active' rather than assuming, since a passive monitor without a matched amp won't produce sound at all."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How far should I sit from studio monitors?",
    "a": "Most near-field studio monitors, including every pick in this comparison, are tuned for a listening distance of roughly 3 to 4 feet, which matches a typical desk setup; sitting much farther away moves you outside the monitor's intended sweet spot."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need an audio interface to use studio monitors?",
    "a": "Most powered studio monitors can connect directly to a computer's headphone output or a basic audio interface via RCA, TRS, or XLR cables; a full audio interface isn't strictly required but does improve sound quality and gives you more input options for recording."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are bigger studio monitors always better?",
    "a": "No. A larger woofer reproduces more low-frequency detail but can also overload a small, untreated room with bass buildup, making 5-inch monitors the safer, more accurate choice for most home studio desk setups rather than an 8-inch pair."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use studio monitors as regular speakers?",
    "a": "Yes, but studio monitors are tuned for flat, accurate reproduction rather than the boosted bass and treble many consumer speakers use to sound more exciting, so music may sound noticeably different, more neutral, than you're used to."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do studio monitors need acoustic treatment in the room?",
    "a": "Not strictly required, but even basic acoustic treatment, like foam panels at first reflection points, meaningfully improves mixing accuracy by reducing the room reflections that near-field monitors are specifically designed to minimize the impact of."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the difference between studio monitors and regular bookshelf speakers?",
    "a": "Studio monitors are built for flat, uncolored frequency response so you hear your mix accurately, while bookshelf speakers are typically voiced to sound pleasant for casual listening, which can mask real problems in a recording or mix."
