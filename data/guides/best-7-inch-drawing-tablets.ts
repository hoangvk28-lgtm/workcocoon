    description: "Wacom's EMR battery-free pen technology is the industry benchmark other brands still get measured against, and the wired Intuos Small delivers that pen-on-paper feel without needing to charge a stylus. Every purchase includes real creative software and access to Wacom's online training, a genuine value-add most budget tablets skip entirely.\n\nAs a screenless pen tablet, it maps to your existing monitor rather than adding a second display, keeping the setup simple and the price low. Wacom backs it with over 40 years in the category, which shows up in driver maturity and long-term software compatibility.",

The 16K pressure sensitivity stylus needs no charging of its own, with two built-in shortcut keys defaulting to right-click and brush/eraser toggle.\n\nSwitching to Android mode uses a specific key-combo (K3+K4 for phone, K2+K5 for tablet) to change Bluetooth pairing targets, a slightly technical but functional workflow. Six customizable shortcut keys plus a multi-function dial round out the controls, though the dial only works in computer mode, not on Android.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does \"7-inch drawing tablets\" always mean the same measurement across different brands?",
    "a": "No. The stated inch value can refer to display diagonal on a pen display or active-area dimension on a screenless tablet, so always confirm which measurement a specific listing means before comparing across brands."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I round up to the next size class if a model is close?",
    "a": "Only if the difference is genuinely small and documented; otherwise a model marketed under a neighboring size class may have different aspect ratio and chassis dimensions than what you actually want."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
