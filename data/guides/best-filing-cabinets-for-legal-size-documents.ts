  "A listing that says a cabinet fits legal-size paper is not the same as a cabinet built to hang legal-size files without a fight. What actually determines fit is internal drawer width, not the cabinet's outer dimensions, and legal hanging rails need about 14.25 inches of spacing between hooks, roughly two inches wider than the letter-size standard. Several cabinets marketed toward general home office use only confirm letter and A4 compatibility, leaving legal-size buyers to guess whether their files will hang correctly or just sit loose in the drawer.",
  "This guide compares 6 cabinets we evaluated based on product specs and buyer feedback, prioritizing which ones explicitly state legal-size hanging file support versus which ones only confirm it for letter and A4. Legal paper is also roughly 27 percent heavier per sheet once a drawer is loaded with a full run of hanging folders, so drawer slide quality matters more here than it does for a lighter letter-only cabinet. Prices range from $44.99 for a narrow vertical cabinet to $129.99 for a fully assembled two-drawer model.",

  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual steel gauge, not just \"metal\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "A filing cabinet described as \"metal\" can still be built with a thin metal face over a particleboard or MDF core rather than genuine steel construction throughout, and even among fully steel cabinets, gauge thickness (a lower number means thicker, sturdier steel) varies meaningfully between products that look nearly identical in listing photos.\n\nThis matters directly for how the cabinet holds up to years of drawer use and how well it resists denting or flexing under a fully loaded drawer's weight.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated steel gauge number, and be skeptical of the word \"metal\" alone without a gauge figure or a clear description of full-steel versus metal-faced construction."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for full-extension versus partial-extension drawer slides",
    "explanation": "Full-extension drawer slides let a drawer pull completely out of the cabinet body, giving access to files at the very back, while partial-extension slides only pull the drawer out part way, leaving files at the rear harder to reach without leaning or reaching awkwardly into the cabinet.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot for daily usability, especially for a deep drawer holding hanging files toward the back, but rarely gets mentioned clearly in listing bullet points that focus on drawer count instead.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"full-extension\" language, and check reviews for mentions of how far drawers actually pull out in practice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm anti-tip safety features if you have kids, pets, or plan a fully loaded cabinet",
    "explanation": "A filing cabinet with multiple drawers can tip forward if more than one drawer is pulled open at once while loaded with paper, a real safety hazard, and better-designed cabinets include an anti-tip interlock mechanism that physically prevents opening a second drawer while another is already open.\n\nThis matters more in a household with kids or pets who might pull on drawers, or if you plan to keep the cabinet fully loaded with heavy paper files rather than lightly used.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated anti-tip or interlock safety feature, since this detail is frequently omitted from budget cabinet listings entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match hanging file compatibility to your actual folder sizes",
    "explanation": "Not every filing cabinet drawer accommodates both letter-size and legal-size hanging files, some are sized for letter only, and a drawer that looks roomy in a photo may not actually fit the wider legal-size folders many home offices and small businesses still use for certain documents.\n\nThis matters directly if any portion of your filing includes legal-size paperwork, buying based on drawer count or overall cabinet size alone without checking hanging-file compatibility is a common and easily avoidable mistake.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for stated letter and/or legal-size hanging file compatibility, not just the general drawer dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh assembly requirements and real delivered weight before ordering",
    "explanation": "Filing cabinets range from fully assembled units shipped ready to use to flat-packed kits requiring meaningful assembly time and, for a genuinely heavy steel cabinet, more than one person to safely maneuver into place.\n\nThis matters because assembly difficulty and real shipped weight are easy to underestimate from a product photo, and a fully assembled cabinet costs more but eliminates that setup friction and the risk of a DIY assembly not being as sturdy as a factory-built one.\n\nCheck the listing for whether the cabinet ships assembled or requires assembly, and check the stated shipping weight against how much lifting and maneuvering you're actually prepared to handle at delivery."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Does a cabinet listed as 'fits legal size' guarantee my files will hang correctly?",
    a: "Not entirely. A legal-size claim is a good starting signal, but internal drawer width of at least 15.25 inches and hanging rail spacing of about 14.25 inches are what actually determine fit. Listings rarely state both to the inch, so treat the label as a first filter, not a final confirmation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does legal paper need a sturdier drawer slide than letter paper?",
    a: "Legal paper is roughly 27 percent heavier per sheet than letter paper, so a fully loaded legal drawer carries more overall weight. A slide rated for around 100 pounds gives more margin against sag than a lighter-duty slide designed with letter-size loads in mind.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are lateral cabinets better than vertical ones for legal-size files?",
    a: "They can be, since a lateral drawer's wider body gives legal folders more side-to-side room without needing the extra front-to-back depth a vertical cabinet requires. The trade-off is that lateral cabinets need more side clearance along a wall.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I put legal files in a letter-size rail cabinet?",
    a: "The folders will not hang correctly on rails spaced for letter width, and may sit unevenly or need to rest loose in the drawer instead of hanging. A separate adapter rail can sometimes convert letter spacing to legal spacing, but this adds cost and is not guaranteed to fit every cabinet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it safe to buy a cabinet that only mentions 'metal construction' without a steel gauge?",
    a: "It is a reasonable pick, but treat vaguer 'metal' language as a weaker signal than an explicit steel claim like the one on the BYNSOE cabinet in this list. Heavier steel gauge holds up better to the added weight of a fully loaded legal drawer over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy a cabinet that doesn't confirm legal-size fit if the price is right?",
    a: "Only if your legal-size filing needs are occasional rather than primary. The GYIIYUO and BYNSOE picks in this list are solid value for letter and A4 documents, but we do not recommend them as your primary legal-size storage solution since neither listing confirms legal compatibility.",
