export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A USB-C Port Physically Fitting the Cable Does Not Guarantee It Supports Video Output",
    "explanation": "The HoDo pick's listing specifically names several popular laptops, including ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7/8, Dell Latitude 3440/3340, and HP EliteBook 855 G7/G8, that have USB-C ports which only support data transfer and charging, not DisplayPort Alt Mode video output, meaning a dock will physically connect but the display function simply won't work. This matters significantly if you own or are considering purchasing one of these specific named models, where the port limitation is a hardware fact regardless of which dock you buy, and matters less if you own a laptop confirmed to have full-featured USB-C video output. Check your exact laptop model's specification sheet for confirmed DisplayPort Alt Mode support over USB-C, not just the physical presence of a USB-C port, before assuming any dock will provide video output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Apple Silicon Macs Have a Genuine Native Single-Display Limitation That Only DisplayLink Technology Can Bypass",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick specifically combines native Alt Mode video with DisplayLink graphics technology to bypass what it describes as native single-display limitations on Apple M1 through M5 MacBooks, a real hardware constraint in Apple's own chip design that a purely native-Alt-Mode dock (like the Acer or HoDo picks) cannot work around regardless of how many HDMI ports it includes. This matters significantly if you're on an Apple Silicon Mac and specifically need extended (not mirrored) multi-display support, where DisplayLink assistance is genuinely necessary, and matters less if you're on Windows where native multi-display support works without this workaround. Check whether a dock specifically includes DisplayLink technology if you're on an Apple Silicon Mac and need extended multi-display output beyond a single external monitor."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Connecting a VGA Port Alongside Digital Outputs Can Cap the Resolution of Every Connected Display",
    "explanation": "The HoDo pick's listing specifically discloses that if the VGA port is connected, it limits the resolution of all displays, including the HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, to 1080p maximum, a real technical constraint of mixing legacy analog VGA with modern digital outputs on the same dock. This matters if you have a legacy VGA display you want to use alongside modern 4K monitors, where connecting VGA would unexpectedly downgrade your other displays' resolution too, and matters less if you don't plan to use the VGA port at all. Check whether connecting a legacy VGA port on a multi-output dock affects the resolution ceiling of your other simultaneously connected displays before assuming each port operates fully independently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Included Power Adapter Matched to the Dock's Rated Wattage Ensures You Actually Receive Full Charging Performance",
    "explanation": "The Acer 13-in-1 pick specifically includes a 110W power adapter in the box, described as essential for reliably running a triple-monitor setup without performance drops, while a dock requiring you to separately source a compatible high-wattage adapter risks underpowering the setup if you use an insufficient charger. This matters if you're setting up a demanding multi-display workstation where consistent power delivery prevents performance drops, and matters less for lighter single-display use where charging headroom is less critical. Check whether a dock's full-power performance depends on an included adapter or requires you to separately source and correctly match a sufficiently rated power adapter."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Physical Lock or Security Slot Matters More in Shared, Dorm, or Public Workspace Environments",
    "explanation": "The Acer 9-in-1 pick's device lock button and the 13-in-1 pick's integrated Kensington-style security slot both add physical security measures specifically useful in shared offices, dorms, or public areas where theft or unauthorized device access is a realistic concern, features the more budget-focused HoDo pick doesn't include. This matters if your dock will be used in a shared or publicly accessible space, and matters less for a private home office where physical device security typically isn't a practical concern. Consider your specific physical environment (shared, public, or private) before deciding whether a dock's built-in security feature is a meaningful factor in your decision."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will any of these docks work with my ThinkPad X1 Carbon?", "a": "Checking your exact ThinkPad X1 Carbon generation is essential, since the HoDo pick's listing specifically excludes Gen 7 and Gen 8 for lacking video-capable USB-C, while newer ThinkPad X1 Carbon generations with full-featured USB-C ports may work fine with any of these picks." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a USB4 laptop dock?", "a": "Assuming any USB-C port on their laptop supports video output simply because a cable physically fits, when many laptops, including several popular business models, have USB-C ports limited to data transfer and charging only, without DisplayPort Alt Mode support." },
  { "q": "Is the Plugable dock worth the extra cost over the Acer picks if I'm on Windows, not Mac?", "a": "If you're exclusively on Windows, the Acer 13-in-1's native triple-display support already delivers similar functionality at a lower price, making the Plugable's DisplayLink technology (specifically valuable for Mac compatibility) less necessary for a Windows-only setup." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my laptop supports the DisplayPort Alt Mode these docks require?", "a": "Checking your laptop manufacturer's official specification sheet for your exact model, or checking whether the manufacturer's dock explicitly lists your model as compatible or incompatible, is the most reliable way to confirm Alt Mode support before purchase." },
  { "q": "Can I use the HoDo dock's VGA port and HDMI ports at full resolution simultaneously?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states that connecting the VGA port caps all connected displays, including HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, to 1080p resolution maximum, so avoid connecting VGA if you want your other displays at full 4K." },
  { "q": "Do these docks require installing drivers before use?", "a": "The Acer picks generally support plug-and-play operation on Windows without drivers, while the Plugable pick specifically requires driver installation on macOS 11 and newer to enable its DisplayLink-assisted multi-display functionality." }
