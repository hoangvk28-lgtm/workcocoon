    q: "What happens if I cancel an existing ink subscription?",
    a: "Some manufacturers reduce the displayed ink level or restrict remaining cartridge use as part of the cancellation process, even if the printer itself still functions. Check your specific model's cancellation policy before canceling if you plan to keep printing with standalone cartridges afterward.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do laser printers avoid the subscription question better than inkjets?",
    a: "Not automatically, but toner cartridges last for thousands of pages compared to a few hundred for inkjet cartridges, so a subscription offer comes up far less often in practice with a laser printer. If print volume is mostly text, that reduces how much the subscription question matters day to day.",
