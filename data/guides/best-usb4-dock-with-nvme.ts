export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An NVMe Enclosure's Actual Interface Speed Varies Dramatically Even Among Similarly Marketed Docks",
    "explanation": "The Satechi CubeDock's enclosure specifically delivers up to 6000MB/s, while the USB C Hub 6-in-1 pick's enclosure specifically delivers up to 1000MB/s, a sixfold difference despite both being marketed as NVMe storage solutions, because they use fundamentally different underlying interface speeds (PCIe 4x4 versus USB 3.1 Gen2). This matters significantly if you're working directly off the dock's storage for large file editing or transfers, where the speed difference is immediately noticeable, and matters much less for occasional file backup or storage of less frequently accessed data. Check the specifically stated MB/s throughput figure for a dock's NVMe enclosure, not just whether it has an 'NVMe slot,' since this single spec varies enormously across products."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The SSD Itself Is Sold Separately in Every Pick in This Comparison, Adding to Your Real Total Cost",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically state the M.2 NVMe SSD is not included, meaning the dock's listed price only covers the enclosure and connectivity hardware, not a complete working storage solution, a cost that applies equally whether you choose the premium Satechi pick or the budget USB C Hub. This matters when comparing total cost across these options, since you'll need to budget for a compatible SSD regardless of which dock you choose, and matters less if you already own a spare M.2 NVMe SSD to install. Factor in the cost of a separately purchased SSD compatible with your chosen enclosure's supported sizes before comparing dock prices as if they were complete solutions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Active Cooling Becomes More Important as Enclosure Speed and Sustained Workload Increase",
    "explanation": "The Satechi CubeDock's adaptive cooling system is specifically engineered to maintain its high-speed 6000MB/s performance during long renders, backups, or gaming marathons, while the fanless USB C Hub pick relies purely on passive aluminum heat dissipation, adequate for its lower 1000MB/s speed but less suited to sustained maximum-throughput workloads. This matters if you regularly push your storage to its performance limits for extended periods, where inadequate cooling can cause thermal throttling that reduces real-world speed, and matters less for occasional, brief file access where heat buildup rarely becomes an issue. Match a dock's cooling design (active fan versus passive) against how demanding and sustained your actual typical storage workload is."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Purpose-Built Single-Model Dock Trades Broad Compatibility for Tighter Physical and Thermal Integration",
    "explanation": "The Qwiizlab pick specifically states it is only compatible with the 2024 Mac mini M4 and M4 Pro chips and explicitly does not support older Mac mini models, a narrow compatibility scope that in exchange delivers a stand specifically engineered to raise that exact device by a precise height for optimal cooling and power button access. This matters if you own the exact supported device, where the purpose-built fit is genuinely better integrated than a universal dock, and matters a great deal if you own a different or older device, where this specific pick simply won't work. Confirm your exact device model and generation against a dock's specifically stated compatibility list, especially for purpose-built single-model docks that explicitly exclude other generations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Combined Display and Storage Docks Solve Two Needs at Once, But at a Meaningful Price Premium",
    "explanation": "The Satechi CubeDock combines its fast NVMe enclosure with premium multi-display support up to triple 8K 60Hz in one unit, letting a single Thunderbolt 5 connection handle both storage expansion and demanding display output, while the more affordable picks in this comparison offer more modest single-display support alongside their storage slot. This matters if you genuinely need both high-end storage speed and demanding multi-display capability simultaneously, where consolidating into one premium dock avoids needing two separate devices, and matters less if you only need one of these two capabilities. Consider whether you actually need both fast storage and premium multi-display support simultaneously before paying for a combined solution over two more affordable, single-purpose devices."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I install any M.2 NVMe SSD into these dock enclosures, or are there specific size requirements?", "a": "Checking each specific listing's supported SSD form factor sizes (commonly 2230, 2242, 2260, and 2280) against your chosen SSD's exact size is worth doing before purchase, since not every enclosure supports every physical SSD size." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a USB4 dock with NVMe storage?", "a": "Assuming any dock with an 'NVMe slot' delivers similarly fast storage performance, without checking the specifically stated MB/s throughput figure, which can vary by a factor of six or more between different enclosure interface standards." },
  { "q": "Is the Satechi CubeDock worth the significant price premium over the UGREEN Revodok for general use?", "a": "If you specifically need the fastest possible storage speed combined with premium multi-display support, the Satechi's premium price is justified, but for general storage expansion and basic display needs, the UGREEN Revodok delivers solid value at a much lower price." },
  { "q": "Will the Qwiizlab dock work with my older Mac mini M2 or M1?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states this dock is only compatible with the 2024 Mac mini M4 and M4 Pro chips and does not support older Mac mini generations, so M1 or M2 Mac mini owners should choose a different pick from this comparison." },
  { "q": "How long does it take to install an SSD into these dock enclosures?", "a": "Most of these enclosures include screws and a screwdriver for a straightforward installation process typically taking just a few minutes, though checking each specific listing's included installation hardware and instructions is worth doing before purchase." },
  { "q": "Do I need special drivers to use the NVMe storage on these docks?", "a": "The picks in this comparison generally state plug-and-play compatibility without requiring special drivers for the storage function itself, though checking your specific operating system's compatibility notes in each listing is worth doing for the smoothest setup experience." }
