export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The Cheapest Budget PoE Injector Often Trades Away Port Speed, Not Just Brand Recognition",
    "explanation": "The lowest-priced pick in this comparison caps at 100Mbps while every other budget option offers full Gigabit speed for just a few dollars more, meaning the price difference between budget tiers here reflects a real functional tradeoff rather than just a brand name premium. This matters significantly if your connected device benefits from Gigabit throughput, like a higher-resolution IP camera, and matters less for a genuinely low-bandwidth device like a basic VoIP phone or access point status light. Check the specific port speed rating on a budget listing rather than assuming all budget-tier injectors share the same core speed capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Certification Marks Like UL, CE, and FCC Provide Real Independent Verification Even at a Budget Price Point",
    "explanation": "A listing that specifically names UL, CE, and FCC certification has been independently tested against defined electrical safety and compliance standards, a meaningfully different assurance level than a listing that simply claims to be safe without naming any specific certifying body. This matters more for a permanent installation where fire and electrical safety are genuine long-term considerations, and matters less for a temporary desktop test setup. Check the listing title and bullet points for named certification marks specifically, rather than assuming a low price automatically means lower safety standards, since certification and price aren't always correlated at the budget tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mode A and Mode B Passive PoE Pin Configurations Can Matter Even for a Simple Budget Injector",
    "explanation": "Passive PoE injectors deliver power on either Mode A pins (1,2 and 3,6) or Mode B pins (4,5 and 7,8), and while most modern 802.3af/at devices support both automatically, some older or specialized equipment supports only one specific mode, meaning a budget injector's stated mode should be checked against your specific device. This matters more if you're connecting older or less common hardware, and matters less with standard modern IP cameras and access points that typically support both configurations. Check your specific device's documentation for its supported mode before assuming a budget injector's stated mode automatically matches."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Integrated Wall-Mount Design Simplifies Installation Compared to a Separate Dangling Power Brick",
    "explanation": "Some budget injectors integrate the power supply directly into a compact unit that plugs straight into a wall outlet, while others use a separate power brick connected by a cable, and the integrated design creates a cleaner, more organized installation especially in a visible location like an office wall or entryway. This matters more for a visible, permanent installation where cable clutter is a real aesthetic and safety concern, and matters less for a hidden installation in a closet or equipment room where appearance matters less. Check the listing's product images and description specifically for an integrated versus separate power supply design if installation tidiness is a priority."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Higher Power Ceiling at a Similar Budget Price Point Provides Real Headroom for a Slightly More Demanding Device",
    "explanation": "The TP-Link pick's 18W ceiling versus the PoE Texas picks' 15W ceiling at a comparable price gives you a bit more power headroom for a device that draws close to the higher end of the 802.3af standard's range, without needing to step up to a pricier 802.3at 30W injector. This matters if your specific device's power draw is uncertain or near the upper end of what a basic passive injector provides, and matters less if you've already confirmed your device draws well within either ceiling. Check your device's actual stated power draw against the specific wattage ceiling of a budget injector before assuming any budget pick provides equivalent headroom."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the cheapest PoE injector always the best value?", "a": "Not necessarily; the lowest-priced pick in this comparison caps at 100Mbps while other budget options offer full Gigabit speed for just a few dollars more, so check the port speed before assuming the lowest price is the best deal." },
  { "q": "What certifications should I look for on a budget PoE injector?", "a": "UL, CE, and FCC are the most commonly cited independent certification marks, and a listing that names all three provides more documented safety assurance than one with no stated certification." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between Mode A and Mode B passive PoE?", "a": "They're different pin configurations for delivering power over the Ethernet cable; most modern 802.3af/at devices support both automatically, though it's worth confirming with older or specialized equipment." },
  { "q": "Can a budget PoE injector power a Gigabit IP camera?", "a": "Yes, as long as the specific injector states Gigabit port speed rather than 100Mbps, which most budget options in this comparison do at only a modest price premium over the cheapest 100Mbps alternative." },
  { "q": "Is a recognized brand name worth paying more for at the budget tier?", "a": "A recognized brand like TP-Link often provides more consistent quality control and support availability, though several lesser-known brands in this comparison still deliver reliable performance at a similar or lower price." },
  { "q": "Do I need a higher wattage budget injector if my device's power draw is uncertain?", "a": "If you're not sure of your exact device's power requirement, a slightly higher wattage ceiling like the TP-Link pick's 18W provides more headroom than the 15W picks without needing to step up to a pricier 802.3at injector." }
