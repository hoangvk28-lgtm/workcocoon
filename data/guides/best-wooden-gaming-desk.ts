    q: "Are wooden gaming desks real wood?",
    a: "No - every gaming desk under $500 on Amazon uses engineered wood (MDF or particle board) with a wood-look laminate surface. The terms rustic brown, walnut finish, and vintage oak describe the color and pattern of the laminate surface, not the wood species of the desk material. This is standard across the category and is not a quality issue for gaming use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do the built-in power outlets on gaming desks have surge protection?",
    a: "Most do not. Desk power strips are typically a standard 4- or 6-socket strip with a cord to the wall outlet. They provide convenience but not surge protection. Use a dedicated surge protector for your PC and monitor - connect it to the wall outlet, not to the desk strip.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the USB-C port on gaming desks used for?",
    a: "Most gaming desk USB-C ports deliver 15W (5V/3A) - sufficient for phone charging but not for laptop fast charging (most modern laptops require 45-100W via USB-C PD). Verify the wattage specification if laptop charging is your primary use case.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between gaming desks with hutch and without?",
    a: "A hutch is an upper shelf structure mounted above the main desk surface. It provides elevated monitor placement and additional storage for headphones, speakers, or decorative items. It also adds visual weight and suits dedicated gaming rooms more than dual-purpose home office and gaming spaces. Desks without a hutch look cleaner and suit multi-purpose use.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a monitor arm on a gaming desk with a built-in monitor riser?",
    a: "Yes, but measure first. A monitor arm clamps to the back edge of the desk or uses a grommet hole. If the built-in riser covers the desk's back edge, you may not have a clean clamp point. Grommet-mounted monitor arms work regardless of built-in risers, provided the desk has a grommet hole in the right position.",
