  "A network switch living in a bedroom, home office, or media console needs to be genuinely silent, not just quieter than a server rack. Every switch in this list is fanless, but there's a real distinction between completely passive designs and switches with a fan that only spins under heavy thermal load.",
  "We differentiated between the two, since a switch with an occasional thermal-triggered fan can still surprise you with noise during a heavy PoE load, even if it's silent most of the time."

export const howToChoose: HowToChooseSection[] = [
  {
    "subheading": "Fully Passive vs Thermal-Triggered Fans",
    "note": "Every switch in this specific list is fully passive, no fan at all, regardless of load. Some higher-power PoE switches elsewhere in this category (like 400W+ 24/48-port units) do include active cooling that only spins under heavy load; check the spec sheet explicitly if total silence matters at higher port/power counts."
  }
];

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Port count is a headroom decision, not a current-need one",
    "explanation": "Buy for what you'll plug in over the next 2-3 years, not just today. An 8-port switch that's already full the day it arrives means buying a second switch and daisy-chaining, which adds a hop of latency and another point of failure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE budget is a shared pool, not per-port",
    "explanation": "A switch rated for 8 PoE+ ports at 120W total does not mean every port gets 30W simultaneously. Add up the real draw of every camera, AP, and phone you'll connect, and make sure the total budget clears it with room to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Managed vs unmanaged changes what you can diagnose later",
    "explanation": "An unmanaged switch is zero-configuration but gives you no visibility when something goes wrong. A smart-managed switch adds VLANs, port mirroring, and traffic monitoring for a modest price increase, worth it the first time you need to isolate a misbehaving device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fanless does not always mean silent under load",
    "explanation": "Most desktop switches are genuinely fanless and silent, but high-port-count PoE switches sometimes add active cooling once the power budget climbs past 200-300W. Check for a fan explicitly if a quiet office or bedroom install matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speed needs matching cable and network gear",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G or 10G switch only delivers those speeds if your cabling is Cat5e or better (Cat6a for 10G) and the devices on both ends actually support that speed. Mixing a multi-gig switch into an all-Gigabit network gets you nothing extra."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Renewed enterprise gear needs a licensing check first",
    "explanation": "Cisco Meraki, Juniper, and some Aruba/HPE switches on Amazon are frequently sold as renewed hardware without an active license or support contract. Confirm what functions before assuming a discounted enterprise switch works like a new one out of the box."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do higher-port-count switches need fans?",
    "a": "Often yes, once total power draw (especially with high-wattage PoE) climbs past roughly 200-300W, many manufacturers add active cooling. If you need both high port count and total silence, expect to pay a premium for a fanless design at that scale, or accept a lower power budget to stay passive."
