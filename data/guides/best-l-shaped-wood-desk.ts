  {
    q: "What is the difference between a left-return and right-return L-shaped desk?",
    a: "The return is the shorter L-leg. Left-return means the shorter section is on your left when seated; right-return means it is on your right. Most listings say \"reversible,\" which means you choose at assembly - not after. Stand at your planned desk position, decide which side you want the return, and commit before you start building.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much space do you need for an L-shaped desk?",
    a: "At minimum: the desk's two leg measurements plus 48\" behind the chair for aisle clearance. For a 55x55\" desk, a 10x10 ft room is workable but tight. A 12x12 ft room is comfortable. The corner triangle (8-12\" on each side) is awkward to use as a primary work surface - measure usable legs independently.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an L-shaped desk worth it for a home office?",
    a: "If you regularly work with multiple screens or need to spread documents and a computer across separate surfaces simultaneously, yes. If you primarily use a laptop and one monitor, a quality straight desk uses space more efficiently. L-shaped desks are most valuable when you genuinely use both surfaces.",

  {
    q: "Are Bush Home desks solid wood?",
    a: "No. Bush Home uses engineered wood (MDF or particle board) with a durable laminate surface. This is standard practice for office furniture at their price point. Bush Home's build quality - hardware, joinery, finish durability - is above average for engineered wood office furniture, but they are not solid hardwood.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the corner of an L-shaped desk good for?",
    a: "The 8-12\" corner triangle is awkward to use as a primary work surface. Good uses: a monitor riser or arm-mounted secondary display, a speaker, a webcam, a phone charging stand, or a cable routing box. Do not plan to use the corner triangle for your keyboard or primary monitor - the angle creates neck and wrist strain.",
