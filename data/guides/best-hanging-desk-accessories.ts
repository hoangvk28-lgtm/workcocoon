export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm attachment method honestly, since \"hanging\" doesn't always mean drill-free",
    "explanation": "Many products that rank well for this exact search are actually wall-mounted organizers requiring drilling into drywall or a stud, not a no-drill desk-edge clamp, and the two are meaningfully different commitments, a wall mount is more permanent and leaves holes if removed, while a desk-edge clamp installs and uninstalls without any wall damage at all.\n\nThis distinction matters directly for a rented space or shared office where drilling isn't an option, discovering after purchase that a \"hanging organizer\" actually means wall-mounted is a common and avoidable disappointment.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for the attachment method, wall-mount with anchors versus a no-drill desk-edge or under-desk clamp, not just the word \"hanging\" in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity against a genuinely loaded file collection, not an empty demonstration",
    "explanation": "A hanging organizer's rated weight capacity is often demonstrated with a few empty folders in marketing photos, which understates how heavy a real collection of paper-filled hanging files or a stack of mail actually gets over time.\n\nThis matters because an organizer rated just barely above a light demonstration load can sag, bend, or pull loose from its mount once genuinely loaded with paper over weeks of accumulation.\n\nCheck the listing for a specific stated weight capacity in pounds, and estimate your own realistic loaded weight, folders plus their actual paper contents, before comparing that against the rated figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider tier adjustability if you're organizing mixed folder or document sizes",
    "explanation": "A fixed-height tier layout works fine if everything you're storing is a similar size, but mixed document types, oversized folders, small mail, or varying folder thicknesses, often don't fit evenly into fixed spacing, leaving some tiers cramped and others wasting space.\n\nIndependently adjustable tiers let you customize spacing to your actual mix of items rather than accepting a one-size-fits-all layout. This matters more the more varied your actual filing needs are, less if you're storing one consistent type of document.\n\nCheck whether tier spacing is adjustable or fixed before assuming any multi-tier organizer accommodates your specific mix of items."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match the organizer's footprint to your actual available wall or desk-edge space",
    "explanation": "A vertical hanging organizer with several stacked tiers needs meaningful wall height to install properly, and a wide organizer needs horizontal clearance that a narrow desk-edge run may not have, dimensions that are easy to underestimate from a product photo alone without checking actual measured space.\n\nThis matters directly for a smaller office or a desk positioned against a window or other fixed feature that limits available mounting area.\n\nCheck the listed dimensions against your actual measured wall or desk-edge space, not just the general size category, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh material and finish for how visible the organizer will be in your workspace",
    "explanation": "Materials range from basic wire mesh to powder-coated metal to wood-finish designs, and beyond just durability, the finish affects how the organizer looks in a visible desk or wall spot versus a fully out-of-sight utility area.\n\nThis matters more if the organizer sits in a visible, client-facing, or shared office space where appearance is part of the decision, less if it's tucked into a back-office utility spot.\n\nCheck the listed material and finish against how visible the mounting location actually is, and weigh durability needs (a fully loaded file organizer sees real daily stress) alongside appearance."
