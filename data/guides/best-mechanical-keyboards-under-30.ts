export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The Phrase 'Mechanical Feeling' Is a Red Flag Indicating a Membrane Keyboard, Not a Genuine Mechanical Switch",
    "explanation": "Many budget keyboards under $30 use the phrase 'mechanical feeling' or 'mechanical feel' in their listing title specifically because they use membrane switches designed to mimic mechanical typing sensation without the actual individual spring-and-switch mechanism underneath each key that defines a true mechanical keyboard. This matters because membrane keyboards generally have a shorter lifespan, less consistent keystroke registration, and a mushier feel than genuine mechanical switches, even though they're priced similarly. Check the listing for a specific named switch type, like 'red switch', 'blue switch', or a brand name like Cherry, Gateron, or Kailh, rather than accepting vague 'mechanical feeling' language as confirmation of a genuine mechanical keyboard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Linear, Tactile, and Clicky Switch Types Produce Genuinely Different Typing Experiences Worth Understanding Before Buying",
    "explanation": "A linear switch, like the red switches on the MageGee and Redragon picks, moves smoothly from top to bottom with no bump or click, favored for fast gaming inputs, while a clicky switch, like the blue switches on the RisoPhy and 60% Wired picks, has a distinct tactile bump and audible click that many typists prefer for accuracy feedback but which can be distracting in shared spaces. This matters because switching between these feels is a genuinely different experience, not just a marketing distinction, and picking the wrong type for your use case can make typing less comfortable or gaming less responsive. Consider whether you're mostly gaming, mostly typing, or sharing a workspace with others before choosing based on switch color alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "N-Key Rollover Support Determines Whether Complex Simultaneous Key Combinations Actually Register Correctly",
    "explanation": "N-key rollover, confirmed on all four picks in this comparison, means the keyboard can accurately detect and register every key pressed simultaneously, no matter how many, which matters directly for gaming scenarios requiring multiple simultaneous inputs like strafing while jumping and shooting, or for touch typists who naturally overlap keystrokes during fast typing. A keyboard without full N-key rollover might only register a limited number of simultaneous presses correctly, dropping inputs during complex combinations. Check the listing specifically for '100% anti-ghosting' or 'N-key rollover' language, since a board advertising only 'anti-ghosting' without the N-key rollover specification might have more limited simultaneous key support."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 60% or Compact Layout Requires Learning Function-Key Shortcuts for Keys That Aren't Physically Present",
    "explanation": "The 60% Wired pick's compact 61-key layout omits dedicated arrow keys, function row, and number pad entirely, requiring you to learn an Fn+Space shortcut just to access basic directional navigation, a real adjustment period for anyone used to a full-size or even TKL layout. This matters if you frequently use arrow keys for navigation or editing tasks, where the extra step of holding a function key combination adds friction to routine actions. Consider your actual daily typing and navigation habits honestly before choosing the smallest layout purely for its desk-space savings, since the adjustment period can be genuinely frustrating for some workflows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length at This Price Point Varies More Than Buyers Expect and Signals Manufacturer Confidence",
    "explanation": "The Redragon pick's stated 24-month warranty is double the more typical 1-year coverage found on many budget mechanical keyboards, a detail that can matter if a switch or key fails after the standard return window closes but before the keyboard has seen significant use. This matters more for a first mechanical keyboard purchase where you're still learning what to expect from the category and want a safety net if something goes wrong early on. Check the specific warranty length stated in the listing rather than assuming all budget keyboards carry the same coverage period, since this detail varies meaningfully even among similarly priced options."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How do I know if a cheap keyboard listing is using real mechanical switches or just marketing language?", "a": "Look for a specific named switch type like 'red switch', 'blue switch', or a recognized brand name in the listing, and be cautious of listings that only say 'mechanical feeling' or 'mechanical feel' without naming an actual switch type, since that phrasing typically indicates a membrane keyboard." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between linear and clicky switches at this price?", "a": "Choosing a clicky blue switch for a shared office or dorm environment without considering the noise level, since the audible click on every keystroke can be genuinely disruptive to people nearby, making a quieter linear red switch the better choice for shared spaces." },
  { "q": "Is the Redragon pick worth it over the cheaper 60% Wired option?", "a": "If you want hot-swappable switch customization and a full-size layout, yes, but if you just want the smallest footprint with genuine mechanical switches at the lowest price, the 60% Wired pick covers that for about $7 less." },
  { "q": "Can I replace the switches on the MageGee or RisoPhy keyboards if they're not hot-swappable?", "a": "Not without soldering, since only the Redragon pick in this comparison explicitly supports tool-free hot-swapping, so if switch customization matters to you, that's the pick to choose from this tier." },
  { "q": "Do any of these budget mechanical keyboards work without installing software?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison are plug-and-play with no required drivers or software for basic function, though the Redragon pick's macro editing feature does require its included software to access that specific customization." },
  { "q": "How long do genuine mechanical switches typically last compared to membrane keys at this price point?", "a": "Genuine mechanical switches, like the ones confirmed on all four picks here, are generally rated for tens of millions of keystrokes, meaningfully longer than typical membrane keyboard lifespans, which is part of why confirming a real switch type matters even at a budget price." }
