export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What width desk hutch fits a small desk?",
    a: "Most small desks run between 28 and 40 inches wide. A hutch between 29 and 38.6 inches wide works well for the majority of small desk setups. The adjustable NUTIKAS (16-28 inches) and YIGANG (29 inches fixed) are best for the narrowest desks, while the Furinno 37-inch and Snughome 38.6-inch models suit desks in the 36-40 inch range.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a desk hutch hold a monitor?",
    a: "Most open-shelf desk hutches are not designed to hold monitors directly. They are intended to sit behind or beside the monitor on the desk surface. The Furinno 37-inch model is wide enough to frame a 24-inch monitor on either side, but none of the hutches in this roundup have a shelf rated for monitor weight placement above desk level.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are pegboard desk hutches worth the extra cost?",
    a: "Pegboard hutches cost $5-10 more than standard shelf-only models. They are worth the premium if you regularly store headphones, cables, scissors, or small tools that would otherwise sit on a shelf. If your main storage need is books and folders, a standard open-shelf hutch saves the money without any functional loss.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much weight can a desk hutch hold per shelf?",
    a: "Lightweight particleboard hutches in this roundup are generally suited for paper, books, and small bins rather than heavy equipment. Most are not rated beyond 10-15 lbs per shelf. For heavier items, a wall-mounted shelf system or a hutch with metal framing is a better choice.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a desk hutch and a desk shelf?",
    a: "A desk hutch typically has multiple tiers and sits on the desk surface to create a vertical storage tower, often behind the monitor. A desk shelf usually refers to a single-tier riser or monitor stand. Both serve similar organizational purposes but differ in height and storage capacity. The hutches in this roundup all have two or more tiers.",
