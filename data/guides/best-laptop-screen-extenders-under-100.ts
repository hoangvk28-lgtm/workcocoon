export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Nits and Color Gamut Figure Beats Vague Display Language",
    "explanation": "Nearly every laptop screen extender at this price uses a similar 1080P IPS panel, but listings vary in whether they state specific brightness (measured in nits) and color gamut coverage (like 72% NTSC or 72% sRGB) versus only describing the display as \"vibrant\" or \"crisp\" without numbers. A stated figure gives you something concrete to compare across products, while vague language tells you nothing you can verify. Also note that NTSC and sRGB are different color space standards, so a 72% NTSC figure and a 72% sRGB figure aren't directly the same measurement even though they look similar on paper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "HDMI Connections Often Need a Separate Power Cable",
    "explanation": "Several extenders in this price range can be powered entirely through a single USB-C to USB-C cable if your laptop has a full-featured Type-C port, but if you're connecting via HDMI instead, most of these same extenders require an additional USB-A cable purely for power. This isn't a defect, it's how the technology works, but it means an HDMI-based setup involves two cables rather than one, worth planning for before assuming a single HDMI cable is all you'll need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rotation Range Matters More If You Present to Others",
    "explanation": "Most budget extenders offer at least 180 degrees of rotation, enough to switch between landscape and portrait orientation and adjust the viewing angle for yourself. A wider range, like 226 degrees on some picks, specifically enables turning the screen fully toward someone sitting across from you without repositioning your entire laptop. If you mostly use the extender solo at a desk, the extra rotation range matters less than if you regularly share your screen with clients or colleagues in person."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for Proactively Disclosed Compatibility Caveats",
    "explanation": "Some listings specifically call out devices that may not work well with the extender, like certain Surface models lacking the required port configuration, rather than making a blanket \"works with everything\" claim. A listing willing to name specific exceptions is generally more trustworthy than one claiming universal compatibility with no caveats, since no laptop screen extender genuinely works with every device on the market."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In Speaker Isn't Universal at This Price",
    "explanation": "Some extenders in this comparison include a built-in speaker, useful for video calls or media playback without relying on your laptop's own speakers, while others don't mention audio output at all. If you plan to use the extended screen for video calls specifically, check for this feature explicitly rather than assuming it's included, since its absence isn't always obvious from a listing's main title or images."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a special USB-C port for these extenders to work with just one cable?", "a": "Yes, single-cable operation over USB-C requires your laptop's port to support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or DisplayPort Alt Mode, sometimes labeled differently by manufacturers. If your laptop only has a basic USB-C port without video output support, you'll need to use the HDMI plus USB-A power combination instead." },
  { "q": "Why do some extenders need two cables instead of one?", "a": "When connecting via HDMI, the extender still needs a separate power source since HDMI itself doesn't carry power, so you'll need an additional USB-A cable plugged into your laptop or a wall adapter specifically for power. This is standard across most extenders at this price, not a defect in any specific model." },
  { "q": "What's the real difference between 72% NTSC and 72% sRGB color coverage?", "a": "These are two different color space standards used to measure how much of the visible color spectrum a display can reproduce, and while the percentages look similar, they aren't directly comparable to each other. Generally, a percentage in sRGB terms represents a somewhat wider practical color range than the same percentage in NTSC terms, though both are reasonable for general productivity and media use at this price tier." },
  { "q": "Will one of these extenders work with an older laptop that only has USB-A ports?", "a": "Check the specific listing's compatibility section carefully, since most extenders at this tier are designed around USB-C or HDMI connections rather than USB-A alone. A laptop with only USB-A and no HDMI output likely won't work with any of the picks in this comparison without an additional adapter not included in the box." },
  { "q": "Is 226 degrees of rotation actually useful, or is 180 degrees enough for most people?", "a": "For solo desk use, 180 degrees is generally sufficient to adjust the viewing angle and switch between landscape and portrait modes. The extra range matters specifically if you regularly turn the screen to show content to someone sitting across from you, like during in-person client presentations." },
  { "q": "Do these extenders drain my laptop's battery quickly?", "a": "Power draw is generally modest since these are low-power IPS panels, and several listings specifically describe energy-efficient operation, but exact battery impact varies by your laptop's own battery capacity and how you're powering the extender. If you're using the extender for extended sessions away from an outlet, expect some additional battery drain compared to using your laptop alone." }
