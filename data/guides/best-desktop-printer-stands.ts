    "criterion": "Verify real weight capacity against your printer's actual weight, not the display model",
    "explanation": "A printer stand's listed weight capacity is often demonstrated with a small inkjet in marketing photos, which understates the load a genuinely heavy all-in-one laser printer or multifunction unit with a large paper tray actually places on the platform.\n\nThis matters because a stand rated below your specific printer's real weight can flex, wobble, or fail over time even if it looks sturdy when empty, and this category overlaps heavily with CPU tower stands and monitor risers that were never marketed for printer weight specifically.\n\nCheck your printer's actual listed weight in its own spec sheet, and compare it directly against the stand's stated capacity with real margin, not just enough to technically clear the number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for genuine vibration stability, not just static weight capacity",
    "explanation": "A printer generates real vibration during operation, especially a laser printer's internal mechanisms or an inkjet's print head carriage moving back and forth, and a stand that holds static weight fine can still wobble or transmit noise during active printing if its construction isn't rigid enough.\n\nThis matters more for a printer used frequently throughout the day, where vibration and noise become a real recurring annoyance, less for one used only occasionally.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of stability or wobble during actual printing, not just whether the stand holds the printer's weight while sitting idle."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider ventilation clearance for a printer's exhaust and paper path",
    "explanation": "Many printers vent heat from internal components and need clearance around the paper output tray for pages to eject without jamming, and a stand or enclosure that boxes the printer in too tightly can interfere with both, and this becomes a real issue with fully enclosed cabinet-style stands versus open shelf designs.\n\nThis matters more for a printer under regular heavy use generating real internal heat, and for any stand style that partially encloses the unit rather than a simple open platform.\n\nCheck the stand's design for open sides or back clearance around where your printer vents and ejects paper, not just its front-facing dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match storage features to what you'll actually use them for",
    "explanation": "Many printer stands include drawers or shelves for paper and supplies, and while this consolidates printer supplies in one spot, an oversized storage-heavy stand can eat significantly more floor or desk space than a simple platform-only riser, without adding proportional benefit if you don't actually keep much paper or supplies nearby.\n\nThis matters directly if floor or desk space is genuinely tight, where a simpler platform-only design maximizes the space savings that's likely the whole point of buying a stand in the first place.\n\nCheck the stand's actual footprint including any drawers or shelves against your available space, not just the platform surface dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh honest labeling: a CPU stand or monitor riser can work just as well as a dedicated printer stand",
    "explanation": "This product category overlaps heavily with CPU tower stands and monitor risers, since a low, stable platform rated for real weight works just as well under a compact printer as under a computer tower, even when it was never marketed specifically as a printer stand, and this often means more design and price options than searching \"printer stand\" alone would surface.\n\nThis matters because limiting your search strictly to products labeled \"printer stand\" can mean missing a better-built, better-priced option marketed for a different but functionally identical use case.\n\nCheck listed dimensions and real weight capacity rather than the product category label alone, since a well-built CPU stand or monitor riser with adequate capacity is a legitimate substitute."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Is it fine to use a CPU tower stand as a printer riser?",
    a: "Yes, as long as the platform's weight rating and dimensions fit your printer. Several picks in this list, like the Liitrton and both Hovadova stands, are sold specifically as CPU tower stands, but their low, flat, adjustable platforms perform the same job under a compact printer. Just don't assume a stand rated for a lightweight PC tower will hold a heavy laser all-in-one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does heat dissipation matter for a printer stand?",
    a: "Laser printers in particular generate real heat during and after a print job, and a sealed acrylic or laminate riser traps that heat against the base rather than letting it escape. An open, ventilated design, like a metal-tier cart or a slotted CPU stand, dissipates heat more effectively, which can help with the printer's long-term reliability.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if a riser can actually hold my printer's weight?",
    a: "Check your printer's listed weight, usually in the product specs or manual, and compare it against the stand's stated capacity. Acrylic-style risers in this category commonly max out around 20-25 lbs, while a heavier all-in-one laser printer with a scanner lid can weigh 40 lbs or more, well past what a light riser is rated for.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the ideal height for a desktop printer riser?",
    a: "It depends on whether you mostly sit or stand at your desk. A low riser that lifts the printer only a few inches suits seated use best, keeping the paper tray at a comfortable reach, while a taller multi-tier cart works better if you want the printer closer to counter height or want extra shelves for supplies underneath.",

    q: "Can a printer overhang the edge of a riser or CPU stand safely?",
    a: "A small overhang is usually fine as long as the printer's weight sits mostly over the platform's base, but a significant overhang can make the stand less stable and can block a drawer underneath from opening fully. Measure your printer's footprint against the stand's usable surface before buying if this is a concern.",

    q: "Do open-shelf utility carts work as well as dedicated printer stands?",
    a: "Functionally, yes. Open metal utility carts like the Simple Houseware and Pipishell were not designed with printers in mind, but their sturdy frames, decent weight capacity, and open airflow make them a solid substitute for a purpose-built printer stand, often at a similar or lower price.",
