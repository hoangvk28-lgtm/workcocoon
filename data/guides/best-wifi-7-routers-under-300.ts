export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Complete Mesh System's Included Unit Count Matters More Than Its Per-Unit Speed",
    "explanation": "When comparing a mesh system like the NETGEAR Orbi 370 to a single powerful router, remember that the mesh system's three units each individually have lower peak speed than a single high-end tri-band router, but the total effective coverage across your whole home is often better because you're not relying on one signal source to reach every room. Before assuming a single router with a higher Mbps number is the better buy, consider whether your home's actual layout and size genuinely benefits from multiple access points instead of maximum single-point speed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 10 Gbps Port Is Future-Proofing, Not a Requirement for Most Current Internet Plans",
    "explanation": "Very few residential internet plans currently exceed 2.5 Gbps, meaning a router's 10 Gbps port, like the one on the TP-Link Archer BE600 in this comparison, mostly benefits buyers who either already have or expect to upgrade to a multi-gig fiber plan in the near future, or who want extremely fast local wired transfers between devices on their home network, like a high-performance NAS. If your current and foreseeable internet plan tops out around 1-2.5 Gbps, a router with a 2.5 Gbps port, like the ASUS or D-Link picks here, delivers essentially the same practical internet speed for less money."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Combined Bandwidth Figures Can Make Tri-Band Routers Look More Similar Than They Actually Are",
    "explanation": "A stated combined bandwidth figure, like 9,400 Mbps or 9 Gbps, adds together the theoretical maximum across all three bands, but doesn't tell you how that total is distributed. Two tri-band routers with similar combined totals can have meaningfully different individual 6GHz, 5GHz, and 2.4GHz figures, so if a specific band matters most for your use case, like maximizing 6GHz speed for a low-interference connection to a nearby device, check the individual per-band numbers rather than comparing only the combined total."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Router's Physical Design Matters More Than It Might Seem if It's Not Hidden Away",
    "explanation": "Most routers are designed with function prioritized over appearance, using an angular, tech-forward look that some buyers prefer to keep out of sight in a closet or cabinet. If your router needs to sit in a visible living space, like a shared apartment living room, a design-conscious option like the D-Link R95's sculptured-wing aesthetic is a genuinely different value proposition than picking based on raw specs alone, since where you can actually place a router for optimal signal also affects your home's real coverage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check Whether a Mesh Ecosystem Is Proprietary Before Assuming You Can Mix Brands Later",
    "explanation": "The NETGEAR Orbi 370 mesh system in this comparison only expands with additional Orbi-branded satellites, similarly, ASUS's AiMesh only works with other AiMesh-compatible ASUS routers, and neither is interchangeable with a different brand's mesh ecosystem. If you're buying into a specific mesh or extendable router ecosystem at this price point, confirm you're comfortable staying within that same brand for any future expansion before assuming you can freely mix and match hardware from different manufacturers later."
  }

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the NETGEAR Orbi 370's dual-band mesh actually slower than a tri-band single router like the TP-Link BE600?", "a": "In terms of raw peak per-unit speed, yes, the tri-band BE600 has a higher maximum theoretical speed than any single Orbi 370 unit. However, for whole-home coverage in a larger space, the Orbi's three-unit mesh design often delivers more consistent real-world speeds throughout the house than a single router straining to cover the same total area." },
  { "q": "Do I actually need a 10 Gbps port if my internet plan is only 1 Gbps?", "a": "Not for your internet connection specifically, since a 2.5 Gbps port already exceeds a 1 Gbps plan's needs. A 10 Gbps port mainly benefits future internet plan upgrades or very fast local wired transfers between devices already on your home network." },
  { "q": "Can I add more Orbi 370 satellites to the 3-pack if I need even more coverage?", "a": "Yes, NETGEAR states the system is expandable with additional Orbi 370 Series satellites, each adding up to 2,000 sq. ft. of additional coverage, useful if your home turns out to be larger than the included 3-pack's stated 6,000 sq. ft. coverage." },
  { "q": "What's the practical difference between the ASUS RT-BE90U and the D-Link R95 since both are tri-band at similar prices?", "a": "Both deliver similar combined bandwidth figures around 9 Gbps, but the ASUS pick emphasizes its AiMesh extendable ecosystem and Smart Home Master multi-SSID features, while the D-Link pick specifically emphasizes its living-room-friendly design and self-optimizing mesh support." },
  { "q": "Will a tri-band router actually perform noticeably better than a dual-band mesh system in a small apartment?", "a": "In a small apartment where a single router's signal easily reaches every room, a tri-band single router like the TP-Link BE600 likely delivers a better experience than setting up a 3-unit mesh system, which is more valuable for larger or multi-story spaces." },
  { "q": "Is the D-Link R95's self-optimizing mesh feature the same as NETGEAR Orbi's mesh system?", "a": "No, these are separate proprietary mesh technologies from different manufacturers; the D-Link R95's self-optimizing mesh only expands with compatible D-Link devices, not with NETGEAR Orbi hardware or other brands' mesh systems." }
