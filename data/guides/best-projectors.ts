export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "ANSI Lumens vs Marketing Lumens",
    "explanation": "Brightness is measured in lumens, but listings often quote an inflated 'peak' or marketing lumens figure instead of the standardized ANSI (or ISO) lumens rating that actually predicts real-world brightness. A projector claiming 8,000 'lumens' at a budget price is almost always using an unstandardized measurement, since genuine ANSI-rated brightness at that level requires expensive optics few budget projectors have. Check the spec sheet specifically for the word 'ANSI' or 'ISO' next to the lumens figure, not just a bare number in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Throw Ratio and Room Distance",
    "explanation": "Throw ratio describes how far the projector needs to sit from the screen to produce a given image size, expressed as distance divided by image width; a 1.2:1 ratio means 12 feet of distance produces a 10-foot-wide image. Buying a projector with the wrong throw ratio for your room means either a much smaller image than expected or one that overflows the screen and needs to sit further back than the room allows. Measure your actual projector-to-wall distance first, then check that figure against the specific throw-ratio range listed for the model, not just its rated maximum screen size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Native Contrast Ratio, Not Dynamic",
    "explanation": "Contrast ratio is the single most important spec for how deep blacks look and how much shadow detail survives in dark scenes, but many listings only publish a 'dynamic contrast' figure that the projector achieves by cycling its own lamp brightness rather than a true optical measurement. Native (on/off) contrast reflects the projector's real optical performance and is usually a far lower, more honest number than the dynamic figure quoted on the box. Look specifically for 'native contrast' in the spec sheet, and treat any unqualified contrast ratio over roughly 50,000:1 as a dynamic-mode number rather than a real optical spec."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Native Resolution vs Pixel-Shifting 4K",
    "explanation": "'4K' on a projector can mean two very different things: a true native 4K chip, or a lower-resolution chip using pixel-shifting technology to simulate 4K detail by rapidly displaying overlapping frames. Pixel-shifting 4K looks convincingly sharp at typical seating distances and screen sizes under about 120 inches, while true native 4K only becomes visibly necessary on larger screens or closer seating in a dedicated theater setup. Check whether the listing says 'native 4K' or describes a pixel-shifting/enhancement technology, since the price difference between the two is substantial for a difference most casual viewers won't notice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Light Source Type and Total Ownership Cost",
    "explanation": "A projector's light source is either a traditional lamp (a replaceable bulb rated for roughly 2,000-5,000 hours) or a laser diode (rated for tens of thousands of hours with no bulb to replace). A lamp-based projector costs less upfront but adds a real recurring expense, often $150-300 per replacement bulb, that buyers frequently forget to budget for when comparing sticker prices. Calculate the total cost of ownership over your expected years of use, including at least one bulb replacement for a lamp-based model, before assuming the cheaper listed price is actually the better value."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What's the difference between ANSI lumens and regular lumens on a projector?",
    "a": "ANSI lumens is a standardized brightness measurement using a specific testing protocol, while an unqualified 'lumens' figure can be measured any way the manufacturer chooses, including at a single bright point rather than averaged across the image. Always compare projectors using their ANSI (or ISO) lumens rating specifically, since two projectors both claiming '5000 lumens' can differ dramatically in real brightness if only one is ANSI-rated."
  },
  {
    "q": "How many lumens do I need for my room?",
    "a": "Roughly 1,500+ ANSI lumens works for a fully dark room at 100-120 inches, 2,500+ ANSI lumens handles some ambient light, and 3,500+ ANSI lumens is needed for a bright room or any daytime viewing. These figures assume a matte white screen; a higher-gain screen or darker walls can let you get away with somewhat less brightness."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a laser projector worth the extra cost over a lamp-based model?",
    "a": "It depends on usage: laser projectors eliminate bulb replacement costs and reach full brightness instantly, which matters most for daily or heavy use, but casual viewers watching a few hours a week may never need to replace a lamp-based projector's bulb during its useful lifetime anyway, making the lamp-based option the better value."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a higher contrast ratio always mean a better picture?",
    "a": "Only if it's a native contrast figure. A 'dynamic contrast' number in the hundreds of thousands is achieved by the projector adjusting its own lamp brightness scene to scene, not by genuine optical black-level performance, so it doesn't reliably predict real picture quality the way a native contrast spec does."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I mount any projector on the ceiling?",
    "a": "Most projectors support ceiling mounting, but check the specific throw ratio and lens-shift range first, since ceiling placement changes the projector's distance and angle to the screen compared to a shelf or table placement, and not every model has enough keystone correction or lens shift to compensate cleanly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a special screen, or can I project onto a white wall?",
    "a": "A wall can work for casual use, but even flat matte white paint reflects light less evenly and with lower contrast than a purpose-built screen surface, which is specifically engineered for uniform light reflection; for any serious home theater setup, a proper screen makes a real, visible difference in image quality."
