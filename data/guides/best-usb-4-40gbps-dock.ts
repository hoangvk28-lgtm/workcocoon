export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Genuine 40Gbps USB4 Connection Delivers Roughly 4x the Bandwidth of a Standard 10Gbps USB-C Dock",
    "explanation": "The Hagibis pick's listing specifically states that most standard Type-C docking stations only offer 10Gbps upstream bandwidth, making its full 40Gbps connection 4 times faster, a concrete comparison that clarifies why 'USB4' or '40Gbps' branding represents a meaningfully different tier of dock than a standard USB-C 3.2 hub. This matters directly if you regularly transfer large files, work with external SSDs, or run multiple bandwidth-intensive peripherals simultaneously, and matters less if you only use a dock for basic charging and a single display. Check whether a dock specifically states a 40Gbps figure (indicating genuine USB4 or Thunderbolt bandwidth) versus a lower figure like 10Gbps (indicating standard USB-C 3.2), since these represent fundamentally different performance tiers despite superficially similar-looking product listings."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Whether 40Gbps Applies Upstream, Downstream, or Both Determines Real Multi-Device Performance",
    "explanation": "The Hagibis pick specifically clarifies its USB4 downstream port delivers a full-function 40Gbps connection combining data, video, and power simultaneously, while some docks might advertise a 40Gbps upstream host connection but step down individual downstream ports to lower speeds for cost reasons. This matters if you plan to run multiple demanding peripherals from the dock's downstream ports simultaneously, where a bottlenecked downstream port limits your actual multi-device throughput regardless of the impressive upstream figure, and matters less if you only use one primary downstream connection at a time. Look for a listing that specifically clarifies whether its stated 40Gbps bandwidth applies to the upstream host connection, individual downstream ports, or the full system, rather than assuming a single headline figure applies everywhere."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thunderbolt Certification and Intel EVO Certification Are Distinct, Verifiable Third-Party Standards",
    "explanation": "The 3-port Plugable pick specifically states Thunderbolt certification built on the Intel Goshen Ridge chipset, while the 5-in-1 Plugable pick specifically states it's uniquely certified as Engineered for EVO by Intel, two different but both genuine third-party certification programs that verify specific performance and compatibility standards beyond a manufacturer's own marketing claims. This matters if formal certification is a priority for compatibility assurance across a wide range of laptops, and matters less if you're comfortable relying on user reviews and general product reputation instead. Check for the specific named certification (Thunderbolt certified, Intel EVO certified, or similar) rather than assuming any dock claiming '40Gbps' or 'USB4 compatible' has gone through equivalent formal certification testing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Own Power Consumption Reduces the Effective Charging Wattage Delivered to Your Laptop",
    "explanation": "The Hagibis pick's listing transparently discloses that the dock itself consumes approximately 20W of its 100W PD input, meaning it delivers up to 80W (not the full 100W) to the connected laptop, a real-world power budget detail that affects whether the dock can keep pace with your laptop's actual charging needs during heavy use. This matters if your laptop requires close to the dock's maximum rated wattage to charge while under load, where the dock's own power draw could leave insufficient headroom, and matters less if your laptop's charging needs are comfortably below the dock's rated output even after accounting for its own consumption. Check whether a listing discloses the dock's own power draw and the resulting net wattage delivered to your laptop, rather than assuming the full stated PD wattage reaches your device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Portable Power Adapter Size Matters More Than Buyers Often Consider for a Travel-Oriented Dock",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS pick specifically includes a notably smaller power adapter designed for road warriors who also travel with a portable USB-C monitor, a genuinely different design priority than the bulkier, higher-wattage adapters bundled with the desk-anchored Plugable picks in this comparison. This matters if you regularly travel with your dock and want to minimize bag weight and bulk, and matters less if the dock lives permanently at one desk where adapter size is irrelevant. Consider a dock's specific power adapter size and portability, not just its core bandwidth specs, if travel use is a genuine part of your intended use case."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does 40Gbps mean I'll get faster internet speeds through these docks?", "a": "No, the 40Gbps figure refers to the USB4 or Thunderbolt data bandwidth for connected devices like external drives and displays, not internet or network speed, which is instead determined by the dock's separate Ethernet port speed if one is included." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when shopping for a 40Gbps USB4 dock?", "a": "Assuming any dock advertising '40Gbps' or 'USB4' delivers that bandwidth uniformly across every port, when some docks apply the full 40Gbps only to specific ports while others run at standard, slower USB speeds." },
  { "q": "Is the Thunderbolt-certified Plugable pick worth the extra cost over the Hagibis dock for general use?", "a": "If formal Thunderbolt certification and daisy-chain expansion for multiple SSDs matter to you, the Plugable pick's higher price is justified, but for general dual-display and peripheral use, the Hagibis dock's transparent bandwidth disclosure and lower price make it a strong alternative." },
  { "q": "Can I daisy-chain multiple external monitors using the Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Hub's 3 ports?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically states you can connect multiple high-performance SSDs or daisy-chain up to 6 additional Thunderbolt peripherals total, which can include additional Thunderbolt-compatible displays depending on your host system's own display output limits." },
  { "q": "Will these docks work with a laptop that only has USB-C but not USB4 or Thunderbolt?", "a": "They will generally work at reduced functionality, since standard USB-C ports without USB4 or Thunderbolt support won't unlock the dock's full 40Gbps bandwidth or maximum display resolution, so checking your specific laptop's exact port type is worth doing before purchase." },
  { "q": "Do I need the exact power adapter included with these docks, or can I use a different one?", "a": "Using the specifically included or manufacturer-recommended power adapter is generally advised to ensure you receive the dock's full rated wattage and stable operation, since a substitute adapter with different specifications may not deliver the same performance or could be incompatible." }
