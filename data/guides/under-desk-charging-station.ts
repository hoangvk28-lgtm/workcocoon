  {
    question: "Can wireless charging work through a wooden desk?",
    answer: "Yes -- Qi and Qi2 wireless charging works through wood up to approximately 30mm thick. Most standard desk tops (18--25mm) work reliably at full charging speed. The desk material must be non-metallic: wood, laminate, MDF, glass, stone, or bamboo all work. Metal desk tops block wireless charging completely.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I mount a charging station under my desk without drilling?",
    answer: "Use a clamp-style station -- the Anker Nano 10-in-1 Clamp or Tessan 14-in-1 both clamp to the desk edge without screws. For wireless charging, the NeatCharge adhesive pad requires no drilling either. Only the screw-mount power strip requires drilling.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best way to hide a charging station on a desk?",
    answer: "Three options in order of visibility reduction: (1) Clamp station at the back desk edge -- hardware visible only from behind. (2) Screw-mount strip under the desk -- completely hidden. (3) Through-desk wireless pad -- charging hardware is entirely invisible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does under-desk mounting damage the desk?",
    answer: "Clamp mounts: no damage if silicone pads are used. Adhesive pads: removable without damage if removed carefully within 6 months (longer adhesion can leave residue). Screw mounts: small pilot holes remain -- only suitable for owned furniture.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will an under-desk clamp work on a sit-stand desk?",
    answer: "Yes -- clamp stations like the Anker Nano move with the desk as it raises and lowers. The power cord should have enough slack for the full height range. For most sit-stand desks with a 70--120cm height range, a 5-foot power cord is sufficient.",
