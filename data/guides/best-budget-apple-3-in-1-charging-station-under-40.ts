export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Do these charge iPhone at full 15W MagSafe speed?",
    a: "The ESR and KEEPRO picks are rated for 15W MagSafe. Achieving 15W requires a USB-C PD 20W+ adapter, if your adapter is weaker, iPhone defaults to 7.5W Qi regardless. Use a 20W+ USB-C adapter for full speed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Apple Watch charger included?",
    a: "No, none of the picks in this guide include the Apple Watch charging disk (the small magnetic puck). You need Apple's USB-C Magnetic Fast Charge Cable or an Apple-certified third-party puck. The stations provide the arm and positioning.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between MagSafe and Qi?",
    a: "Qi is the universal wireless charging standard, all iPhones from iPhone 8 support Qi at up to 7.5W. MagSafe is Apple's magnet-based system (iPhone 12+) that aligns the charger precisely and enables 15W. Qi chargers work on iPhones but only at 7.5W.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 25W MagSafe worth the extra $10 over 15W?",
    a: "In practice: 25W charges iPhone 16 Pro from 0-50% about 15 minutes faster than 15W. For overnight charging, both complete fully, 15W is perfectly sufficient. 25W matters for quick 30-45 minute top-ups.",
  },
  {
    q: "What AirPods support wireless charging?",
    a: "AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd gen), AirPods 3, and AirPods 4 support Qi wireless charging. AirPods 2nd gen (non-Pro) requires the Wireless Charging Case (sold separately). Original AirPods do not support wireless charging.",
