Wireless setup connects it to a home network without extra cabling. At this price, expect a single combined color cartridge design common to entry printers, meaning printing any single color still draws down the whole cartridge. It's a solid fit for light home printing but plan for standard cartridge pricing once the trial ends. Instant Ink trial offsets early ink cost. Set against that, combined color cartridge raises cost once any single color runs low. Both matter when comparing it to the other picks here.",
