export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "IP66 and IP67 Waterproof Ratings Sound Similar but Certify Genuinely Different Levels of Water Protection",
    "explanation": "An IP66 rating, like the YuanLey pick's, certifies protection against powerful water jets from any direction, while an IP67 rating, like the LINOVISION and Cudy picks', adds certified protection against temporary submersion in up to 1 meter of water, a meaningfully higher standard that most buyers don't realize is a real, different certification level rather than a marketing variation. This matters significantly if your installation location could face standing water or flooding risk, and matters less for a wall-mounted unit under an eave that only faces rain and spray. Check the exact IP rating number on a listing rather than assuming any 'waterproof' or 'weatherproof' label means the same level of protection across different products."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dedicated High-Wattage Output Port Is Necessary for Devices Like PTZ Cameras That Exceed Standard PoE Power",
    "explanation": "The Tliffpaco pick specifically includes one dedicated 60W IEEE 802.3bt output port alongside three standard 30W ports, recognizing that some outdoor devices like pan-tilt-zoom cameras or larger access points draw more power than a standard 802.3af/at port can supply. This matters significantly if any device in your outdoor installation is a higher-power PTZ camera or similar device, since connecting it to a standard 30W-only extender could result in the device failing to power on or operating in a reduced-power mode. Check your specific outdoor device's power requirements against an extender's per-port wattage rating, not just its total combined output figure, before assuming any port will adequately power any device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cascade Distance Figures Represent a Multi-Unit Configuration, Not the Distance Achievable From a Single Extender",
    "explanation": "The YuanLey and Cudy picks both specifically state their maximum 1312ft distance is achieved through 3-level cascading, meaning three separate extender units chained together, not the distance a single unit alone provides. This matters if you're comparing extenders based on their headline maximum distance figure, since a single unit's actual individual extension range (330ft in this case) is meaningfully shorter than the multi-unit cascade total advertised as the product's maximum capability. Check whether a stated maximum distance requires purchasing and cascading multiple units, or whether it's achievable from a single extender alone, before budgeting for your actual installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Explicit Surge Protection Adds Real Value in Storm-Exposed Locations but Isn't Universal Across Similarly Priced Extenders",
    "explanation": "The Cudy pick specifically discloses built-in surge protection, a real electrical safeguard against transient voltage spikes from nearby lightning or power fluctuations, a feature not explicitly stated on the lower-priced YuanLey or Tliffpaco picks in this comparison. This matters significantly if your installation is in a location genuinely exposed to storms or electrical surge risk, and matters less for a sheltered installation with stable power infrastructure nearby. Check whether a listing specifically names surge protection as a feature, rather than assuming any outdoor-rated extender includes this safeguard by default."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Warranty and Named Technical Support Commitment Provide Real Recourse for an Outdoor Installation That's Harder to Access",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's specifically stated lifetime 24/7 US local and global technical support goes beyond a standard 1-year warranty, providing ongoing help for an outdoor installation that may be mounted somewhere harder to physically access or troubleshoot than an indoor device. This matters if your extender will be mounted in a hard-to-reach outdoor location where diagnosing an issue yourself is more difficult, and matters less for an easily accessible installation where you're comfortable troubleshooting hardware issues independently. Check whether a listing specifically names an ongoing support commitment beyond just a warranty period, if remote troubleshooting help matters for your specific installation's accessibility."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is an IP66 rating good enough for a wall-mounted outdoor PoE extender?", "a": "For most wall-mounted installations under an eave or overhang facing rain and spray, an IP66 rating like the YuanLey pick's is generally adequate, though an IP67 rating adds real additional protection if your location could face standing water or flooding." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an outdoor PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming a stated maximum cascade distance is achievable from a single extender unit, when several listings specifically require chaining 2 to 3 units together to reach their full advertised maximum distance figure." },
  { "q": "Is the Cudy extender worth the higher price over the YuanLey pick?", "a": "If you're installing in a genuinely storm-prone or adverse climate and want explicit surge protection alongside IP67 waterproofing, the Cudy's higher price is justified, but for a more moderate outdoor environment, the YuanLey's lower price and IP66 rating are likely sufficient." },
  { "q": "Can I power a PTZ security camera with a standard 30W PoE extender port?", "a": "Not reliably; a PTZ camera often draws more power than a standard 30W IEEE 802.3af/at port can supply, so checking for a dedicated higher-wattage port like the Tliffpaco pick's 60W IEEE 802.3bt output is worth doing before connecting a PTZ camera." },
  { "q": "Do these outdoor PoE extenders need their own power supply?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison are unmanaged extenders that draw power directly from the upstream PoE source, requiring no separate local power supply or outlet at the extender's installation location." },
  { "q": "How do I know if I need cascade support for my outdoor installation?", "a": "If your device is farther than a single extender's stated individual range (typically around 330ft), you'll need cascade support to chain multiple units together, so checking your actual required distance against a single unit's base range before assuming you only need one extender is worth doing." }
