  {
    "criterion": "Understand duty cycle as a maximum ceiling, not a healthy day-to-day volume",
    "explanation": "A printer's rated duty cycle is the absolute maximum number of pages it can print in a month before risking premature wear, not a figure representing comfortable, sustained daily use, printing consistently near that ceiling month after month accelerates wear on the print mechanism well beyond what the same printer would experience at a more moderate, realistic volume.\n\nThis matters because buying a printer rated just barely above your expected monthly volume often means running it closer to its stress limit than its comfortable operating range.\n\nCheck the listed duty cycle figure, and target a printer rated at 3 to 5 times your actual expected monthly volume for genuinely comfortable long-term use, not a printer rated just above what you think you'll print."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match multi-user wifi sharing to how many people will actually print from it",
    "explanation": "A printer's wireless sharing capability varies in real-world reliability between models, some handle multiple simultaneous connection requests from different devices smoothly, while others can drop connections or queue print jobs unreliably when more than one person tries to print around the same time.\n\nThis matters directly for a shared home office or household with multiple people printing throughout the day, less for a single dedicated user.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of multi-device wifi reliability, not just whether wireless printing is listed as a supported feature, since the feature existing and working reliably under real multi-user load aren't the same thing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check scan resolution against what you're actually digitizing, not just print quality",
    "explanation": "Print quality specs get most of the attention in printer listings, but scan resolution, measured in DPI, determines whether a scanned document stays genuinely readable when zoomed in or printed again later, and this spec is often buried or only briefly mentioned compared to print specs.\n\nThis matters more if you regularly scan contracts, receipts, or other documents where legibility of fine print matters, less if scanning is an occasional, low-stakes task.\n\nCheck the listed optical scan resolution in DPI specifically, not just the printer's overall feature list, if document scanning is a real part of your workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh whether legacy features like fax are worth paying for in a 2026 home office",
    "explanation": "Many home-office printers still bundle a fax feature as a holdover from an earlier era, adding to the printer's cost and complexity even though most home offices in 2026 will genuinely never use it, having largely moved to email and digital document sharing entirely.\n\nThis matters for value, paying for a feature you'll never touch is a real, if often overlooked, inefficiency when a fax-free model at a lower price covers the same core printing and scanning needs.\n\nCheck whether fax is a genuine requirement for your specific situation before treating its presence as a meaningful selling point, and consider a fax-free model if it isn't."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider ink versus toner cost per page for your actual print volume, not just the printer's price",
    "explanation": "An inkjet printer is typically cheaper to buy upfront but has a meaningfully higher cost per printed page than a laser printer using toner, a gap that adds up significantly over months of real use at moderate to high volume, while a laser printer costs more initially but can work out cheaper in total ownership cost if you print regularly.\n\nThis matters directly based on your actual expected volume, a low-volume occasional printer may never recoup a laser printer's higher upfront cost, while a high-volume home office likely will.\n\nCheck the manufacturer's stated or estimated cost-per-page for both ink and toner options, and weigh that against your realistic monthly print volume, not just the printer's sticker price."

  {
    q: "How much slower is duplex printing than single-sided printing?",
    a: "Expect roughly 5 to 10 seconds added per page for the internal flip, so a printer rated at 20 pages per minute single-sided often runs closer to 10 pages per minute effective in duplex mode. Budget extra time for large two-sided print jobs accordingly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is duplex printing the same as duplex scanning?",
    a: "No, these are different features that are frequently conflated. Duplex printing means the printer automatically prints both sides of a page. Duplex scanning means the ADF automatically scans both sides of a page. A printer can have one without the other, we've flagged where a listing confirms scan/copy duplex but not print duplex, and vice versa, in this guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I duplex print on cardstock?",
    a: "Generally no. The automatic duplex mechanism on most printers is built for standard weight paper, roughly 20-24 lb, and cardstock or heavier stock typically can't go through that path without jamming. Print cardstock single-sided instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does duplex printing actually save much money?",
    a: "The real savings are modest, roughly $10 a year at typical home-office volume around 500 pages a month. It's a genuine and easy saving on paper, but don't expect it to significantly offset your overall printing costs, ink or toner remains the bigger expense.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does duplex-printed text sometimes show through the page?",
    a: "Thinner paper is more transparent, so content on one side can faintly show through the other, more noticeable on recycled or colored paper than standard bright white copier paper. Use a slightly heavier paper weight for duplex jobs where this would be distracting.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if a printer's duplex printing is actually confirmed?",
    a: "Check the product listing and spec sheet directly for the word \"duplex\" or \"two-sided printing\" stated explicitly. Several capable all-in-one printers, like the Canon PIXMA TR8620a and Brother INKvestment 4355 in this guide, don't state it clearly in their listings, so we've included them only as secondary alternatives rather than confirmed duplex picks.",
