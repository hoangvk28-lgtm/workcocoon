export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Why does my power bank charge my phone fewer times than the mAh suggests?",
    "a": "The mAh rating is measured at the battery's internal voltage, not the voltage your phone charges at, so conversion losses mean you get roughly 60 to 70% of the rated capacity as real usable charge, closer to 3 to 4 phone charges from a 20,000mAh power bank rather than 5-plus."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I bring my power bank on a plane?",
    "a": "It depends on watt-hours (Wh), not mAh: up to 100Wh is allowed without airline approval, up to 160Wh with prior permission, and nothing above that on any commercial flight; power banks must also go in carry-on luggage, never checked bags."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I convert power bank mAh to Wh for flying?",
    "a": "Multiply the mAh by the battery's voltage (commonly 3.7V) and divide by 1000; a 27,000mAh power bank at 3.7V works out to roughly 100Wh, right at the limit allowed without airline approval."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a higher-wattage power bank charge my phone faster?",
    "a": "Only if your phone supports that charging speed; an 18W-capable phone won't charge any faster from a 65W power bank than an 18W one, so match the power bank's wattage to your specific device's actual charging spec, not just the highest number available."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is pass-through charging on a power bank?",
    "a": "It lets the power bank charge your device while it's simultaneously being charged itself, useful if you're leaving it plugged in at a desk as backup power; not every power bank supports this safely due to heat buildup, so check the listing specifically."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does a power bank's battery actually last?",
    "a": "A standard lithium-ion cell typically retains about 80% of its original capacity after 300 to 500 full charge cycles, while premium lithium-polymer or LiFePO4 cells hold up longer, so daily charging habits matter as much as the day-one capacity spec."
