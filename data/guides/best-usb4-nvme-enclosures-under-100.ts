export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Identify the actual controller chip, not just the 40Gbps number",
    explanation: "The controller chip is the piece of hardware inside the enclosure that translates between the NVMe SSD and the USB4 port, and it determines real-world speed and compatibility far more than the advertised interface speed does. Most enclosures in this price range use the ASM2464PD chip, which has a strong compatibility track record across Windows, macOS, and Linux, while a few use Intel's JHL7440 chip alone or paired with a second bridge chip for added reliability. Look for the chip name spelled out in the listing's bullet points or specifications, not just the headline \"40Gbps\" claim, since two enclosures with the same speed rating can behave differently depending on which chip is actually inside."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match cooling method to your actual usage pattern",
    explanation: "Enclosures cool the SSD either actively, with a small fan that spins up under load, or passively, using a finned metal body that dissipates heat without any moving parts. A fan-cooled enclosure generally holds full speed longer during hours of continuous transfer, which matters for large video exports or full backup jobs, while a fanless design runs completely silent but has less thermal headroom if you push it hard for an extended period. Check the listing for words like \"fan,\" \"cooling fan,\" or \"active cooling\" versus \"fanless\" or \"passive cooling,\" and pick based on whether your typical use case is short file transfers or long sustained sessions."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Confirm your SSD's physical thickness and side-mounting are supported",
    explanation: "M.2 NVMe SSDs come in single-sided designs (memory chips on one side only) and double-sided designs (chips on both sides), and some enclosures physically cannot fit a double-sided drive because there's no clearance on the inside. Several listings in this category explicitly name specific SSD models they don't support, such as certain WD_BLACK or Crucial drives, precisely because those drives are double-sided or unusually thick. Before buying, check your SSD's spec sheet for \"single-sided\" or \"double-sided,\" and cross-reference that against the enclosure listing's compatibility notes rather than assuming any M.2 drive fits any enclosure."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check whether your SSD already has a heatsink, and whether the enclosure allows for one",
    explanation: "Some NVMe SSDs ship from the factory with their own heatsink already attached to help with cooling inside a desktop PC, but that same heatsink can prevent the drive from fitting inside a USB4 enclosure designed for a bare drive. At least one enclosure in this comparison explicitly states it does not support SSDs that already have a heatsink attached, since there's no internal clearance for both the drive's heatsink and the enclosure's own cooling accessories. Check your SSD's product listing for \"heatsink included\" language, and if it has one, look specifically for an enclosure that either accommodates it or doesn't bundle its own conflicting heatsink."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Verify your host device can actually deliver 40Gbps before paying for it",
    explanation: "A 40Gbps-rated enclosure only reaches that speed when plugged into a USB4 or Thunderbolt 3/4 port on a host device that itself supports the full 40Gbps standard, and several listings specifically note that older Thunderbolt versions or certain USB-C ports fall back to a much lower 10Gbps USB 3.2 speed instead. This matters most on older laptops or budget desktops where a USB-C port looks the same on the outside but supports a fraction of the bandwidth. Check your laptop or desktop's exact port specification (not just \"USB-C\") for \"Thunderbolt 4,\" \"Thunderbolt 3,\" or \"USB4\" labeling before assuming you'll see the full advertised speed."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Do I need a Thunderbolt port specifically, or does any USB-C port work with these enclosures?",
    a: "Every enclosure in this comparison works in a standard USB-C port, but only reaches its full 40Gbps speed on a Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB4-certified port. A standard USB-C 3.2 port will still work, just at a much lower speed, typically 10Gbps or less, so check your device's exact port specification before expecting full speed."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a double-sided M.2 SSD in any of these enclosures?",
    a: "Not universally. Some enclosures, including the top pick in this comparison, are built only for single-sided SSDs and explicitly list incompatible double-sided models. Check both your SSD's spec sheet and the enclosure's stated compatibility list before buying, since this detail is easy to miss in the main bullet points."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a fanless enclosure worth choosing over a fan-cooled one?",
    a: "It depends on your usage. A fanless design runs completely silent and has no fan bearing to wear out, making it a good fit for quiet desk setups with typical short file transfers. If you regularly run hours-long sustained transfers, like large video exports, a fan-cooled enclosure generally holds full speed longer under that kind of sustained load."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do these enclosures list different maximum read/write speeds if they're all rated for the same 40Gbps interface?",
    a: "The 40Gbps figure describes the interface's theoretical ceiling, not the enclosure's real-world tested speed, which depends on the specific controller chip, the SSD used in testing, and the host device. That's why one listing cites 3800MB/s and another cites 2700MB/s despite both being 40Gbps-rated: they're reporting real tested numbers on their own specific hardware combination, not the same theoretical maximum."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I plug a 40Gbps enclosure into an older laptop's USB-C port?",
    a: "It will still work, but at a reduced speed. If the port only supports USB 3.2 rather than Thunderbolt or USB4, the connection falls back automatically to whatever speed that port supports, often 10Gbps or lower. Several enclosures in this comparison include a status LED that changes color specifically to show you when this fallback has happened."
  },
  {
    q: "Do any of these enclosures come with an SSD included?",
    a: "No. Every enclosure in this comparison is sold empty, meaning you supply your own M.2 NVMe SSD separately. This is standard for the category and lets you choose your own capacity and drive brand rather than being locked into a bundled drive."
