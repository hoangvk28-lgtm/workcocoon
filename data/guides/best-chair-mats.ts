  "The right chair mat depends almost entirely on 2 things most buyers skip past: what floor is underneath it and, if it's carpet, how thick the pile actually is. A mat built for hard floor has a smooth flat underside meant to protect the floor finish, while a mat built for carpet needs cleats or spikes to grip the fibers and a pile-height rating to match, and mixing the two up is the most common reason a chair mat underperforms.",

    "explanation": "Listings for a chair mat often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the chair mat holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this chair mat over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any chair mat you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A chair mat that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

  {
    q: "Can I use a carpet chair mat on a hard floor, or vice versa?",
    a: "It's not recommended either way. A hard-floor mat's smooth, flat underside has nothing to grip carpet fibers with and will slide around, while a carpet mat's cleats or spikes can scratch a hardwood or laminate finish. Dual-use picks like the MuArts, GLSLAND, or Koonmi mats in this guide are built to genuinely work on either.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I really need a chair mat if my hardwood floor is in good shape?",
    a: "Not necessarily. If your hard floor is well-maintained and your chair has quality, non-marking casters, a mat may not be needed purely for floor protection, though it can still make the chair roll more smoothly and reduce noise.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know my carpet's pile height before buying a mat?",
    a: "Low pile is under 1/4 inch, medium pile runs 1/4 to 1/2 inch, high pile is 1/2 to 3/4 inch or more, and extra-high pile with padding runs over 1 inch. Most standard office carpet mats, including several picks in this guide, are rated for low pile only, so measure or check your carpet spec sheet before assuming any mat will fit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is tempered glass so much more expensive than PVC or polycarbonate mats?",
    a: "Glass is the most durable of the 3 main material categories and the only one immune to scratching, denting, or yellowing over years of use, and it's dual-use on carpet or hard floor. That durability and versatility is reflected in the higher price of picks like the Koonmi and Lorell mats in this guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why won't my new chair mat lie flat?",
    a: "Mats shipped rolled up need roughly 24 hours lying flat to fully relax before they settle into shape. This is the most common cause of a 'defective' flatness complaint and usually resolves on its own within a day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which mat in this guide is rated for the thickest carpet?",
    a: "The Marvelux Heavy Duty Polycarbonate Mat is the only pick in this guide's polycarbonate lineup rated for carpet up to 3/4 inch, covering medium and high pile. Most other carpet-rated picks here top out at low pile, under 1/4 inch.",
