export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Passive PoE Sends Power Without the Negotiation That Active PoE Standards Use, Creating a Real Overvolt Risk",
    "explanation": "The UCTRONICS pick specifically warns that non-standard passive PoE switches deliver power without negotiation, which can overvolt and damage a device expecting a properly negotiated IEEE 802.3af/at connection, a genuine safety risk distinct from active PoE's built-in device detection and voltage negotiation. This matters significantly if you're connecting a device that specifically expects standard negotiated PoE, since a mismatched passive power source could cause real damage, and matters less if your device is specifically designed for a known, fixed passive voltage. Verify your exact device's PoE compatibility (passive versus negotiated active PoE) before connecting it to any passive splitter, rather than assuming any PoE-labeled adapter is safe for any PoE-labeled device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Documented Voltage Range Determines Which Devices a Passive Splitter Can Actually Power Safely",
    "explanation": "The picks in this comparison range from a fixed 12V (LUORNG) to a wide 12V-48V range (Coaxuhf) to up to 60V (5 Pairs Kit), a real difference in which devices each splitter can safely power, since connecting a device requiring a voltage outside a splitter's supported range could result in inadequate power or potential damage. This matters if your specific device requires a voltage at the edge of or outside a splitter's documented range, and matters less if your device's voltage requirement falls comfortably within any of these ranges. Check your specific device's required voltage against a passive splitter's documented range before assuming any passive PoE splitter works with any device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "10Mbps Speed Limits on Most Passive Splitters Make Them Unsuitable for Bandwidth-Intensive Devices",
    "explanation": "Three of the four picks in this comparison specifically cap network speed at 10Mbps, adequate for basic IP cameras and simple network devices but genuinely limiting for anything requiring higher bandwidth, while the UCTRONICS pick specifically delivers full Gigabit 1000Mbps alongside its power function. This matters significantly if you're powering a device that also needs fast data transfer, like a Raspberry Pi running network-intensive applications, and matters less for a basic camera or sensor with modest bandwidth needs. Check a passive splitter's stated network speed against your specific device's actual bandwidth requirement before assuming any PoE splitter delivers adequate data throughput."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Passive Splitters Reusing Idle Network Cable Lines Avoid Rewiring but Require Compatible Existing Cabling",
    "explanation": "The LUORNG pick specifically explains that its splitter uses idle lines within an existing network cable to power a device without modifying the wiring, a genuinely convenient approach that only works if your existing cable run actually has those idle lines available and in good condition. This matters if you're retrofitting PoE capability onto an existing camera or device installation with cable already run, and matters less for a fresh installation where you're running new cable anyway. Confirm your existing cable run has functional idle pairs available before assuming a passive splitter can add PoE capability without any rewiring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Pair Kit's Per-Unit Cost Only Delivers Value if You Actually Need to Power That Many Devices",
    "explanation": "The 5 Pairs Kit and Coaxuhf pick both bundle five splitter pairs at a similar total price to buying a single pair alone would cost proportionally, delivering real value only if you have that many devices needing passive PoE conversion, while the LUORNG single-pair kit avoids paying for unused pairs if you only have one device. This matters if you're specifically converting multiple devices at once, where the multi-pair kits offer better per-unit value, and matters less if you only need to power a single device, where a single-pair kit avoids unnecessary spending. Count your actual number of devices needing passive PoE conversion before choosing between a multi-pair kit and a single-pair purchase."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a passive PoE splitter safe to use with any PoE device?", "a": "Not necessarily; the UCTRONICS pick specifically warns that non-standard passive PoE can overvolt and damage a device expecting proper negotiated power, so verifying your specific device's passive PoE compatibility before connecting it is important." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a passive PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming any passive PoE splitter is interchangeable with an active, negotiated PoE source, when passive splitters deliver power without the voltage negotiation that protects a device from receiving an incompatible or excessive voltage." },
  { "q": "Is the UCTRONICS splitter worth the higher price over the basic DC-jack kits?", "a": "If you're specifically powering a Raspberry Pi or another micro-USB device that also needs full Gigabit data speed, the UCTRONICS pick's higher price is justified, but for a basic IP camera needing only 10Mbps, the cheaper DC-jack kits deliver adequate performance." },
  { "q": "Can I use a passive PoE splitter to power a device that doesn't natively support PoE?", "a": "Yes, that's specifically the purpose of these passive splitters, converting non-PoE devices like standard IP cameras or access points into PoE-enabled equipment using their DC jack connectors." },
  { "q": "How many devices can I power with a 5-pair passive PoE kit?", "a": "A 5-pair kit like the 5 Pairs Passive PoE Injector and Splitter Kit or the Coaxuhf pick includes enough components to convert up to five separate devices, each requiring its own injector and splitter pair." },
  { "q": "Do I need special tools to install a passive PoE splitter kit?", "a": "No, these kits are specifically designed for plug-and-play installation using standard DC jack and RJ45 connectors, requiring no special tools or network configuration beyond connecting the included components." }
