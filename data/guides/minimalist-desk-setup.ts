  {
    question: "What is a minimalist desk setup?",
    answer:
      "A minimalist desk setup keeps only the items that serve a clear, daily purpose. It is not about having an empty desk -- it is about removing low-value objects so the ones that remain feel intentional. The typical minimalist setup includes a desk mat, one organizer, hidden cables, a compact keyboard, a lamp with no base, and one personal item.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I make my desk look minimalist?",
    answer:
      "Start by removing everything from the desk. Put back only items you use every day. Add a desk mat to define the work zone. Route cables under the desk with a cable tray. Replace separate containers with one organizer. The setup should look clean after these four steps -- then add accessories only if they solve a specific problem.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I keep on a minimalist desk?",
    answer:
      "Keep the monitor or laptop, keyboard, mouse, a lamp, one organizer, and one personal item. Everything else -- chargers, notebooks, headphones, bags -- should either be stored, mounted under the desk, or removed entirely. A wireless charger and a headphone hook handle two of the most common surface clutter sources.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I remove from my desk first?",
    answer:
      "Start with anything you have not touched in a week. Then remove all visible cables and replace them with wireless charging and cable management. Then remove duplicate containers -- if you have two pen cups, keep one. Most people find that clearing cables and consolidating storage makes the biggest visible difference.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I hide cables in a minimalist desk setup?",
    answer:
      "Mount an under-desk cable tray to hold the power strip and excess cable length. Use adhesive cable clips along the rear edge of the desk to guide individual cables toward the tray. Replace charging cables with a wireless charger pad where possible. A USB hub consolidates multiple device cables into one.",
  },
  {
    question: "What colors work best for a minimalist desk setup?",
    answer:
      "The most common minimalist palettes are white and wood, black and walnut, beige and cream, and gray and silver. The key is using no more than two accent colors across all accessories. A neutral desk mat ties the palette together. Avoid brightly colored accessories or matching themed sets, which draw attention to individual items rather than the setup as a whole.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a minimalist desk setup good for small spaces?",
    answer:
      "Yes -- a minimal setup is especially effective on small desks because it maximizes usable surface area. A clamp lamp, slim organizer, and hidden cables free up the most space. A monitor stand with a storage shelf adds a second layer without expanding the desk footprint. See our guide to small desk setup ideas for more.",
