  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best standing desk often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best standing desk holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best standing desk over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best standing desk you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best standing desk that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What standing desk height do I need if I'm 6'2\"?", a: "At 6'2\", the ergonomic standing desk height is approximately 44 to 47 inches, depending on shoe sole thickness and elbow angle. A desk with a 48-inch maximum height gives adequate clearance. For 6'3\" and above, look for 50 inches or more. The FlexiSpot E6 Max (50 inches) and E7 Pro (52 inches) in this guide both cover 6'2\" to 6'5\" ranges." },
  { q: "What is a 3-stage standing desk and why does it matter for tall people?", a: "A 3-stage standing desk frame has three telescoping sections per leg that extend in sequence to achieve greater maximum height. Most standing desks use 2-stage frames that top out at 47 to 48 inches. A 3-stage frame reaches 50 to 52 inches in the same upright footprint. For users 6'2\" and above, a 3-stage frame is often the only way to reach correct ergonomic standing height without raising the desk on risers." },
  { q: "Can I use a regular standing desk if I'm tall?", a: "A standard standing desk reaching 47 to 48 inches will leave most users 6'2\" and taller standing with elbows above 90 degrees, creating shoulder and wrist strain. The ergonomic guidance is to raise or lower the desk until your elbows are at 90 to 100 degrees with your upper arms relaxed at your sides. For tall users, this usually requires a desk that reaches 49 to 52 inches." },
  { q: "Do I also need a special chair for my height?", a: "If you are tall and alternate between sitting and standing, a standard chair may not allow your feet to rest flat on the floor with hips at 90 degrees. Look for chairs rated for users above 6 feet with a seat height range starting at 19 to 21 inches. See our [office chair for tall person](/guide/best-office-chair-for-tall-person) guide for chairs matched to tall-user proportions." },
  { q: "What is the minimum desk depth I should get as a tall person?", a: "For tall users, monitor placement matters more than for average-height users because a 27-inch monitor placed 18 inches away is too close at taller eye levels. A desk depth of 28 to 30 inches allows the monitor to be pushed back 20 to 24 inches from the front edge for comfortable viewing distance. 24-inch deep desks force tall users to tilt their heads down at monitors that are too close." },
