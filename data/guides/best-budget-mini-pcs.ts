export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match RAM and storage to your actual workload, not just the headline spec",
    "explanation": "Mini PC listings often lead with a large RAM number like 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB, but the amount you actually need depends heavily on what you're running: basic web browsing and office work is comfortable at 8 to 16GB, while running multiple virtual machines, a Plex transcoding server, or memory-hungry emulation genuinely benefits from 32GB or more.\n\nBuying far more RAM than your workload needs is simply wasted money, while buying too little means the system will lean on slower disk-based swap memory under load, causing real stuttering that a spec sheet number won't warn you about.\n\nCheck whether the RAM is soldered (fixed at purchase) or user-upgradeable via SO-DIMM slots, since a soldered configuration means you're locked into whatever capacity you buy today with no future upgrade path."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the CPU generation and core count actually mean for your use case",
    "explanation": "A mini PC's processor model number (like an Intel N100, N150, or a specific AMD Ryzen model) tells you its generation and general performance tier, but raw core count and clock speed matter less than how well that specific chip handles your actual workload, since a low-power efficiency chip like the N100 is genuinely fine for a home server or media player but will bottleneck video editing or modern gaming badly.\n\nThis distinction matters because two mini PCs can list similar-sounding specs while being built around completely different design goals, one optimized for low power draw and silence, the other for sustained performance under load.\n\nLook up independent benchmark results for the exact CPU model rather than trusting a generic \"powerful\" or \"fast\" marketing description, since chip model numbers are the one spec that translates directly to comparable real-world performance data."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check whether the mini PC includes dedicated graphics or relies on integrated graphics alone",
    "explanation": "Most mini PCs rely on integrated graphics built into the CPU itself, which handles everyday desktop use, video playback, and light gaming fine, but a genuine dedicated GPU or officially supported external GPU (eGPU) connection is a meaningfully different tier needed for serious gaming or GPU-accelerated video editing work.\n\nThis is a real distinguishing feature worth checking specifically, since \"mini PC\" as a category spans everything from a fanless office box with no gaming capability at all to a compact system that can be paired with an external GPU enclosure for near-desktop gaming performance.\n\nIf your use case involves gaming or GPU-accelerated tasks, check explicitly for a dedicated GPU or a confirmed Oculink/Thunderbolt eGPU connection rather than assuming any mini PC can be upgraded that way."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the exact port selection matches your real peripherals, not just the port count",
    "explanation": "A mini PC's small size means its port selection is fixed at purchase with essentially no room for internal expansion the way a desktop tower allows, so the specific mix of USB versions, display outputs, and networking ports listed matters far more here than on a full-size computer.\n\nCheck specifically for the number and type of display outputs if you run multiple monitors, since some budget mini PCs only support two displays despite having enough physical ports to suggest otherwise, and check for dual Ethernet ports specifically if you're planning a home server, router, or NAS build that benefits from network redundancy or link aggregation.\n\nCount your actual peripherals and required display outputs against the listed ports before buying, since there's no expansion card slot to add what's missing later on most mini PC designs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh fanless passive cooling against active cooling for your noise and thermal tolerance",
    "explanation": "Mini PCs use either active cooling (an internal fan that spins up under load) or fully passive fanless cooling (relying entirely on the metal chassis itself to dissipate heat), and this choice is a genuine tradeoff rather than one being strictly better: fanless designs run completely silent and have no moving parts to fail, but they also throttle performance under sustained heavy load once the passive heatsink reaches its thermal limit, something an actively cooled system with a fan can sustain longer.\n\nThis matters concretely for anyone running a 24/7 home server or media server in a bedroom or living room, where fan noise is a real annoyance, versus anyone running sustained CPU-heavy workloads like video transcoding, where a fanless design may throttle noticeably during long jobs.\n\nCheck whether cooling is explicitly described as fanless/passive or fan-cooled/active, and match that to whether silence or sustained performance matters more for where this mini PC will actually live."
