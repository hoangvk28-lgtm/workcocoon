  "A dual-motor standing desk uses one motor per leg instead of a single motor driving both legs through a synchronization bar, and the practical benefit is real, dual-motor frames generally lift heavier and more evenly distributed loads with less side-to-side lean than a single-motor frame. What rarely gets explained is that dual motor is not one uniform standard, sync quality between the two motors, the weight capacity, and how many memory presets are available still vary a lot between models at different price points.",
  "Below are 8 dual-motor standing desks we evaluated on stated weight capacity, memory preset count, desktop size, and included features like power outlets or cable management, ranging from $94.98 to $169.99. We did not test each frame's motor synchronization directly, so the notes below are framed around what dual motor generally means for stability rather than claims about any individual desk's sync smoothness beyond what the listing states.",

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the dual motor standing desk holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this dual motor standing desk over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any dual motor standing desk you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A dual motor standing desk that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

  {
    q: "Is a dual-motor standing desk actually more stable than a single-motor desk?",
    a: "Generally yes, because two independent motors, one per leg, distribute the lifting load more evenly than a single motor driving both legs through a sync bar. That said, sync quality between the two motors still varies by model, and we haven't independently tested motor synchronization on the picks in this list beyond what each listing states.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my dual-motor desk sound louder than the advertised decibel rating?",
    a: "Quoted noise ratings are usually measured about 1 meter from the motor housing, not from your actual seated or standing distance of roughly 1-2 meters, where real perceived noise is typically several decibels lower. If a desk sounds louder than expected, check the measurement distance the manufacturer used before assuming the unit is defective.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many memory presets do I actually need?",
    a: "If more than one person shares the desk, or you switch between a sitting and standing height several times a day, 4 presets, available on picks like the Huuger 47 x 24 and FLEXISPOT EN1, avoid constant manual re-adjustment. A single consistent user with one sit and one stand height is fine with 3 presets.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the motor warranty cover the same length as the frame warranty?",
    a: "Not usually. Motor and electronics warranties are commonly shorter than frame warranties because the motor is the component most likely to fail first under repeated daily cycling. Check both warranty terms separately on the specific listing before buying rather than assuming one number applies to the whole desk.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do all dual-motor desks include anti-collision sensors?",
    a: "Many do, but sensitivity varies, and a poorly calibrated sensor on a budget frame can false-trigger against a heavy object simply resting nearby rather than an actual collision. If precise sensor behavior matters to you, look for buyer feedback specifically mentioning false-triggering before choosing a model.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a splice-board top and a one-piece top?",
    a: "A splice-board desktop, used on picks like the FEZIBO and Claiks in this list, is assembled from a joined panel and has a visible seam, while a one-piece top, like the FLEXISPOT EN1, is a single continuous surface. The functional difference is mostly cosmetic, but a one-piece top gives a cleaner, seamless look if that matters to you.",
