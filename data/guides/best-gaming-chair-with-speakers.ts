export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity against your actual body weight with real safety margin",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's rated weight capacity is the absolute maximum before the frame, gas lift, and casters are at real risk of failure, not a comfortable operating range, so a chair rated just barely above your actual weight is running much closer to its structural limit than a chair with genuine headroom.\n\nThis matters because a chair operating near its weight limit tends to develop wobble, sagging, or gas-lift failure faster than one with real margin, even if it doesn't fail outright.\n\nCheck the listed weight capacity, and favor a chair rated at least 50-75 lbs above your actual weight rather than one that just barely clears it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify lumbar support is genuinely adjustable, not just a fixed cushion",
    "explanation": "Many gaming chairs include a lumbar cushion or built-in curve marketed as \"ergonomic support,\" but a fixed, non-adjustable lumbar shape only fits correctly for a body proportioned exactly the way the chair was designed for, while a genuinely adjustable lumbar system (height-adjustable, inflatable, or a repositionable pillow) can be tuned to your actual lower back curve.\n\nThis matters directly if you experience real lower back discomfort during long sessions, a fixed lumbar shape that doesn't match your body can be worse than no lumbar support at all.\n\nCheck whether lumbar support is described as adjustable and how (height, firmness, or position), not just whether the word \"lumbar\" appears in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider armrest range of motion for your actual desk height and typing posture",
    "explanation": "Armrest adjustability ranges from simple height-only adjustment to full 4D armrests that move up, down, forward, back, and pivot, and this range matters directly for matching the armrest height to your specific desk and keyboard position, a mismatched armrest height forces shoulders up or wrists at an awkward angle during long sessions.\n\nThis matters more for anyone spending many hours daily typing or gaming, less for occasional use where posture matters less.\n\nCheck the specific armrest adjustment axes listed (2D, 3D, or 4D), not just whether armrests are present, and match that against how much your desk height or seating position varies."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh recline range and locking positions against how you actually use the chair",
    "explanation": "Recline range varies from a modest 90-135 degrees on basic gaming chairs to a near-flat 180 degrees on recliner-style models, and a wider recline range only matters if you'll actually use it, for napping, watching content reclined, or relaxing between gaming sessions, versus sitting upright for focused work or gaming most of the time.\n\nThis matters because a chair with an impressive recline range but a weak recline lock can feel unstable at extreme angles, while a more basic recline range with a solid lock mechanism holds position reliably.\n\nCheck both the maximum recline angle and whether the recline lock holds at multiple positions, not just the maximum angle alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check base material and caster quality for real long-term stability",
    "explanation": "The 5-star base and caster wheels bear the chair's full weight through thousands of rolling and swiveling cycles over the chair's life, and material quality here varies significantly, a genuine steel or reinforced nylon base holds up far better under real weight than a cheaper plastic base that can crack or flex over time, and caster wheel quality affects both smooth rolling and floor protection.\n\nThis matters more for a heavier user or daily long-session use, less for occasional light use.\n\nCheck the listed base material specifically, not just the overall chair material, and check reviews for mentions of base or caster durability after months of use, not just initial assembly quality."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "How long does the battery last on a gaming chair's built-in speakers?", a: "None of the listings in this guide publish an exact battery life figure, which is a gap worth noting since it's a real consideration for this category. Based on typical Bluetooth speaker battery capacities in similar built-in audio products, expect several hours of playback per charge, but confirm directly with the specific listing before buying if battery life is a priority." },
  { q: "What's the Bluetooth range on a gaming chair speaker system?", a: "Chairs with Bluetooth 5.3, like the GTPLAYER GT890MF and both HOFFREE models, typically offer a more stable and longer effective range than older Bluetooth versions, generally up to around 30 feet in open indoor space, though walls and interference reduce that in practice. Always pair from a device reasonably close to the chair for the most reliable connection." },
  { q: "Are gaming chairs with speakers actually different from regular gaming chairs?", a: "Yes. Beyond the added Bluetooth audio hardware, these chairs need to route wiring and battery components through the frame, which changes the internal construction compared to a standard gaming chair. Considerations like speaker placement, Bluetooth pairing reliability, and battery life are specific to this category and worth researching separately from general gaming chair comfort and lumbar support." },
  { q: "Can I use a gaming chair with speakers on a console like PS5 or Xbox?", a: "The X Rocker Prism 2.1 is explicitly built for multi-platform Bluetooth pairing with PS5, Xbox, and Switch. Other chairs in this guide, like the GTPLAYER and HOFFREE models, use standard Bluetooth that can pair with most modern consoles, but they're marketed primarily toward PC desk setups, so double-check pairing compatibility with your specific console before buying." },
  { q: "Do the built-in speakers replace the need for a headset?", a: "For casual listening and background audio, built-in chair speakers work well, but they broadcast sound into the room rather than directly to your ears, which makes them less ideal for competitive gaming where directional audio cues matter or for late-night sessions where you don't want to disturb others. A headset remains the better choice for those specific situations." },
  { q: "Which chair in this guide has the best sound quality?", a: "The X Rocker Prism 2.1 stands out for bass response thanks to its dedicated subwoofer in a 2.1 configuration, which none of the dual-speaker or surround-only chairs in this guide match. For buyers who prioritize a broader soundstage over bass, the GTPLAYER ACE-PRO's patented 360-degree surround sound is the more immersive option." },
