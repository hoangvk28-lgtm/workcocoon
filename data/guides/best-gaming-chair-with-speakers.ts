export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "How long does the battery last on a gaming chair's built-in speakers?", a: "None of the listings in this guide publish an exact battery life figure, which is a gap worth noting since it's a real consideration for this category. Based on typical Bluetooth speaker battery capacities in similar built-in audio products, expect several hours of playback per charge, but confirm directly with the specific listing before buying if battery life is a priority." },
  { q: "What's the Bluetooth range on a gaming chair speaker system?", a: "Chairs with Bluetooth 5.3, like the GTPLAYER GT890MF and both HOFFREE models, typically offer a more stable and longer effective range than older Bluetooth versions, generally up to around 30 feet in open indoor space, though walls and interference reduce that in practice. Always pair from a device reasonably close to the chair for the most reliable connection." },
  { q: "Are gaming chairs with speakers actually different from regular gaming chairs?", a: "Yes. Beyond the added Bluetooth audio hardware, these chairs need to route wiring and battery components through the frame, which changes the internal construction compared to a standard gaming chair. Considerations like speaker placement, Bluetooth pairing reliability, and battery life are specific to this category and worth researching separately from general gaming chair comfort and lumbar support." },
  { q: "Can I use a gaming chair with speakers on a console like PS5 or Xbox?", a: "The X Rocker Prism 2.1 is explicitly built for multi-platform Bluetooth pairing with PS5, Xbox, and Switch. Other chairs in this guide, like the GTPLAYER and HOFFREE models, use standard Bluetooth that can pair with most modern consoles, but they're marketed primarily toward PC desk setups, so double-check pairing compatibility with your specific console before buying." },
  { q: "Do the built-in speakers replace the need for a headset?", a: "For casual listening and background audio, built-in chair speakers work well, but they broadcast sound into the room rather than directly to your ears, which makes them less ideal for competitive gaming where directional audio cues matter or for late-night sessions where you don't want to disturb others. A headset remains the better choice for those specific situations." },
  { q: "Which chair in this guide has the best sound quality?", a: "The X Rocker Prism 2.1 stands out for bass response thanks to its dedicated subwoofer in a 2.1 configuration, which none of the dual-speaker or surround-only chairs in this guide match. For buyers who prioritize a broader soundstage over bass, the GTPLAYER ACE-PRO's patented 360-degree surround sound is the more immersive option." },
