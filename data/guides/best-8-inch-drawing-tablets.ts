A built-in detachable Type-C cable stores compactly, avoiding the loose-cable problem of most portable tablets.\n\nThe vertical layout specifically aligns with how people naturally hold phones for drawing, and six shortcut keys integrate deeply with popular mobile apps like ibis Paint and Concepts. The battery-free stylus delivers 16K pressure levels with 60-degree tilt using inbuilt passive chip electromagnetic technology, compatible with Android 6.0+, Mac, Windows, and Chrome OS.",

  },
  {
    "q": "Should I round up to the next size class if a model is close?",
    "a": "Only if the difference is genuinely small and documented; otherwise a model marketed under a neighboring size class may have different aspect ratio and chassis dimensions than what you actually want."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."

    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
