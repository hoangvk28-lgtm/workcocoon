export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What's the biggest mistake buyers make shopping for large drawing tablets?",
    "a": "Judging quality by pressure-level count alone. Activation force, tilt behavior, and driver stability matter more for real drawing feel than a high number on the spec sheet."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I prioritize price or pen quality when choosing large drawing tablets?",
    "a": "Pen quality first, since a tablet with a poor-feeling stylus won't become more enjoyable to use for being cheaper. Narrow the field by real pen behavior, then compare price among finalists."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
    "a": "A standalone tablet runs its own operating system and apps with no computer needed, while a pen display has a screen but still requires a connected computer or laptop to function, they solve different problems despite both having a visible screen."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a screenless pen tablet harder to learn than one with a screen?",
    "a": "There's a real adjustment period since you're looking at a monitor while drawing on a separate surface, but most users adapt within a few sessions, and screenless tablets cost meaningfully less while offering the same pen precision."
