  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the cartridge-free printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this cartridge-free printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any cartridge-free printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Does cartridge-free actually mean no ongoing ink cost?",
    a: "No. Cartridge-free describes a refillable ink tank system rather than disposable cartridges, but ink bottles are still a recurring purchase. The real benefit is cost per page, bottled ink typically runs a fraction of what the equivalent cartridge volume would cost, not zero ongoing spend.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the printhead clogs on a cartridge-free printer?",
    a: "On most consumer ink-tank models, including the Epson EcoTank line in this guide, the printhead is integrated into the printer rather than separately replaceable. A serious clog after years of use often means replacing the whole printer rather than swapping a part, so routine nozzle checks matter for long-term reliability.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use third-party ink bottles to save more money?",
    a: "You can, but it carries real risk. Cheaper generic ink can cause clogs, produce noticeably different color output, and may void your printer's warranty. Sticking with the manufacturer's own bottles is the safer choice unless you're comfortable with that tradeoff.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Epson EcoTank or Canon MegaTank the better system?",
    a: "It depends on your priority. Epson EcoTank covers a wider range of price points and feature sets in this list, from the budget ET-2400 to the office-grade EcoTank Pro ET-5800. Canon's MegaTank system, represented here by the PIXMA G620, leans toward stronger photo output.",

    q: "Do ink tanks dry out if the printer sits unused for a while?",
    a: "They can. Ink tank ink is more forgiving than small cartridges, but it can still settle and clog nozzles if the printer is idle for 4 or more weeks. Run a test page or nozzle check before an important print job after a long break.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a cartridge-free printer worth it for light, occasional printing?",
    a: "Usually not as strongly as for regular use. The higher upfront price pays off through cheaper ink over volume, so a household printing only a handful of pages a month may be better served by a basic cartridge inkjet, and can revisit an ink-tank model if volume grows.",
