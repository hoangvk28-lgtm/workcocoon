export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A PoE Splitter With Pass-Through Capability Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than a Single-Output Splitter",
    "explanation": "The IPCamPower pick specifically splits incoming PoE into both a 12V DC output and a separate downstream PoE output, letting you power a camera and a separate 12V accessory like an IR illuminator from one cable, a fundamentally different capability than the single-output splitters in this comparison that only convert to DC without any pass-through. This matters significantly if your installation needs to power two separate devices near each other from one cable run, and matters less if you only have one non-PoE device to power. Check whether a splitter specifically offers pass-through or dual-output capability if you need to power more than one device from a single PoE source."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Comprehensive Electrical Protection Specifications Matter Even on an Inexpensive Splitter",
    "explanation": "The SICSOLINK pick specifically names overcurrent, short-circuit, overvoltage, and overpower protection built into its chip, a genuinely comprehensive safety feature set despite being the lowest-priced pick in this comparison, showing that low price doesn't have to mean reduced electrical safety. This matters if you're powering valuable connected equipment where an electrical fault could cause real damage, and matters less if you're powering an inexpensive, easily replaceable device. Check a splitter's specifically named protection features rather than assuming price alone indicates safety quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Specifically Named Device Compatibility List Removes Real Guesswork Before Connecting Your Equipment",
    "explanation": "The PoE Texas pick specifically names compatible devices including Arduino, Foscam, Wansview, Airsight, EasyN, Escam, Q-See, and Apexis, a genuinely specific compatibility disclosure that helps confirm your exact device will work before purchase, rather than a generic 'works with IP cameras' claim. This matters if you own one of these specifically named devices and want confidence before buying, and matters less if your device isn't on any listed compatibility list, where you'd need to verify voltage and connector specifications independently regardless. Check for a specifically named compatibility list matching your exact device model if you want that added purchase confidence."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Selectable Voltage Output Provides Flexibility for Buyers Who Aren't Certain Which Voltage Their Device Needs",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically offers selectable DC12V or DC24V output, letting the same physical splitter serve devices with different voltage requirements, unlike the fixed-12V-only picks in this comparison that only work with 12V devices. This matters if you're deploying the splitter across multiple device types with different voltage needs, or if you're not entirely certain of your specific device's exact voltage requirement, and matters less if you know you specifically need 12V and nothing else. Check whether a splitter offers selectable voltage output if you need flexibility across multiple device types or voltage uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Metal Housing With DIN-Rail Mounting Serves Industrial Installation Contexts Differently Than a Compact Plastic Splitter",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's full metal housing with DIN-rail mounting compatibility targets industrial control cabinet installations, a different physical deployment context than the compact plastic-housed splitters in this comparison designed for simpler camera-adjacent placement. This matters if your installation involves a standardized industrial control cabinet with DIN-rail infrastructure, and matters less for a simple camera installation where a compact splitter mounted near the camera makes more practical sense. Match a splitter's physical mounting format to your actual installation context rather than assuming any splitter's form factor fits your specific deployment."

  { "q": "Can a PoE splitter power both a camera and a separate accessory like a light or siren?", "a": "Only the IPCamPower pick in this comparison specifically offers this dual-output capability, splitting incoming PoE into both a 12V DC output and a downstream PoE output, letting you power two devices from one cable run." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a PoE splitter?", "a": "Assuming any PoE splitter provides pass-through or multi-device capability, when most splitters, including three of the four picks in this comparison, only provide a single DC output without any additional pass-through function." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION splitter worth the higher price over the SICSOLINK pick?", "a": "If you specifically need an industrial metal build with selectable 12V/24V output for a control cabinet or wireless bridge deployment, the LINOVISION's higher price is justified, but for a basic camera installation, the SICSOLINK pick delivers comparable core function for much less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if a PoE splitter is compatible with my specific camera model?", "a": "Checking a listing's specifically named compatible device list, like the PoE Texas pick's list including Foscam, Wansview, and other named brands, or verifying your camera's exact voltage and connector requirements against the splitter's specifications, is the reliable way to confirm compatibility." },
  { "q": "Can I extend my PoE network distance using a PoE splitter?", "a": "The IPCamPower pick specifically states its PoE pass-through output also functions as a network extender, reaching an additional 328ft to a downstream device, a dual-purpose capability the single-output splitters in this comparison don't offer." },
  { "q": "Do I need a metal-housed splitter for an outdoor installation?", "a": "The LINOVISION pick's metal housing suits industrial and outdoor enclosure deployments, though checking a specific splitter's stated indoor/outdoor rating, like the IPCamPower pick's explicit indoor-only designation, is important before installing any splitter outdoors." }
