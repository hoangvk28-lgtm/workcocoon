    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand vesa often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand vesa holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand vesa over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand vesa you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand vesa that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "What does VESA mean for a TV stand?",
    a: "VESA refers to the standardized spacing between the mounting holes on the back of a TV, measured in millimeters like 400x400mm or 800x600mm. A TV stand's bracket needs to match your TV's specific VESA pattern, not just fall within its screen size range.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find my TV's VESA pattern?",
    a: "Check your TV's user manual or the manufacturer's spec sheet, which lists the VESA mount pattern in millimeters. You can also measure the horizontal and vertical distance between the mounting holes on the back of the TV directly if the manual is unavailable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which VESA TV stand covers the widest range of hole patterns?",
    a: "The PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand PSTVS01 (Pick 2) supports the widest max VESA range in this list at 800x600mm, with 2 mounting configurations to match different hole spacings within that range.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a VESA stand rated for a larger pattern on a smaller TV?",
    a: "Not necessarily. A stand's max VESA rating is an upper limit, and the bracket needs holes that also match smaller, more common patterns like 200x200mm or 400x400mm. Check the stand's full compatible range, not just its maximum, before assuming it will fit a smaller TV.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best VESA TV stand for a large or heavy TV?",
    a: "For TVs up to 75 inches with a wide VESA pattern, the PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand PSTVS01 (Pick 2) offers 800x600mm VESA support and 110 lb capacity, the widest range and highest capacity among the tabletop picks in this list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a tabletop VESA mount or a floor-standing VESA stand?",
    a: "A tabletop stand works if you already have a media console, dresser, or table to place the TV on and just need the VESA bracket and height mechanism. A floor-standing unit like the Perlegear PGFS06 (Pick 5) is freestanding and often adds an AV shelf or built-in power outlets, useful if you do not already have furniture for the TV.",
