The all-aluminum frame and steel shaft guide rails keep the beam tracking straight at speed, and the compressed 0.06mm spot size holds engraving accuracy within 0.004 inches.\n\nThe 17\" x 16\" open frame is large enough for full sign blanks and cutting boards, and it works with both LightBurn and the free LaserGRBL, so new users are not locked into paid software just to get started.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verified Power vs Marketed Power",
    "explanation": "Many listings advertise machine input power, sometimes 60-72W, rather than the actual laser output (typically 5-10W) that determines real cutting and engraving performance. Look for a listing that states both figures, or one independently verified, before assuming a higher marketed number means more cutting capability. A 10W diode engraver that clearly separates input from output power is more trustworthy than one that only lists a large single number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Enclosure and Physical Safety Hardware",
    "explanation": "An open-frame laser leaves eye protection, fume containment, and stray-beam exposure entirely to the buyer, while a fully enclosed design with a lid interlock stops the laser automatically when opened. Buyers in apartments, homes with children, or shared workspaces should weigh this before working area or price, since retrofitting an enclosure onto an open-frame machine after purchase is both costly and imperfect. Flame sensors and tilt cutoffs add a further layer that's worth checking for explicitly rather than assumed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Working Area vs Physical Footprint",
    "explanation": "A larger working area only helps if the machine's overall footprint still fits the intended space, since some large-bed machines exceed 20 inches per side once housing and cable clearance are included. Match the bed size to actual planned projects (sign blanks need 16in+, most gift and craft work fits an A4-size 12in bed) rather than buying the largest available bed by default. Object height clearance matters separately from bed footprint for anything taller than a flat panel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Control Software and Workflow",
    "explanation": "Some machines run entirely from a companion phone app or offline TF card, while others require a permanently connected computer running LightBurn, a paid license after a trial period, or LaserGRBL, a free but less polished tool. Decide up front whether jobs will be designed and queued from a phone, a shared shop computer, or offline, since this affects both real project turnaround time and any recurring software cost. AI-assisted design generation from a photo or prompt is a genuine time-saver for buyers without vector-design experience."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Material Compatibility and Cutting Depth",
    "explanation": "Confirm the specific cutting depth claimed for wood and acrylic (commonly stated in millimeters at a given power), not just a general materials list, since a lower-power machine may only mark a material a higher-power one can cleanly cut through in one pass. Machines under 5W typically handle engraving only, while 10W-class diode lasers cut thin plywood and acrylic in a single pass. Multi-pass cutting is possible on lower-power machines but adds real project time."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 10W laser engraver actually more powerful than a 5W one?",
    "a": "Usually yes for cutting depth, but check whether both wattage figures refer to actual laser output rather than one listing input power and another output power, since some listings mix the two. A verified 10W output diode laser will cut thicker material in fewer passes than a verified 5W unit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a fully enclosed laser engraver at home?",
    "a": "Not strictly, but an open-frame machine requires the buyer to source their own ventilation, eye protection, and a way to contain stray beam exposure, which a fully enclosed design handles by default. In an apartment, shared house, or any space with children or pets nearby, a fully enclosed model is the safer default."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the difference between LightBurn and the free apps some machines include?",
    "a": "LightBurn is a paid, general-purpose laser design and control tool used across many brands, while manufacturer apps like CutLabX or MKSLaser are free but typically limited to that specific machine's ecosystem. Either can run a job well; the choice mainly affects whether design work is done on a phone or a full desktop tool."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a diode laser engraver cut metal?",
    "a": "No. Diode lasers in this power range (3W to 10W) can mark or engrave coated or painted metal surfaces but cannot cut through bare metal; that requires a fiber laser, a different technology entirely. Wood, acrylic, leather, and similar organic materials are what these machines are built to cut."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much working area do I actually need?",
    "a": "Most gift, sign, and craft projects fit comfortably within an A4-size bed (roughly 12in x 8in); a larger 16in-plus bed only matters if projects regularly include full sign blanks or oversized panels. Buying a bed larger than actual projects require mostly adds footprint and cost without a practical benefit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a laser engraver need special ventilation?",
    "a": "Yes, for any cutting or heavy engraving job, since the process produces smoke and fine particulate regardless of enclosure. A fully enclosed machine still needs to vent that exhaust outside or through a filter; the enclosure contains fumes during the job but does not eliminate the need for ventilation."
