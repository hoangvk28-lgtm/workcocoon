export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB 3.2 Gen 2 vs Gen 2x2 Is a Real, Large Speed Gap",
    "explanation": "At the 2TB tier, the speed difference between standard USB 3.2 Gen 2 (topping out around 1050MB/s) and Gen 2x2 (up to 2000MB/s) is nearly 4x, a far bigger gap than typically separates drives at lower capacity tiers. This distinction matters specifically for buyers who regularly move very large files like 4K video projects, but it only delivers real benefit if your computer's own port also supports the faster standard. Check both the drive's rated generation and your host device's actual port specification before paying a premium for Gen 2x2 speed you can't fully use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated TBW Rating Gives You a Concrete Longevity Number",
    "explanation": "TBW, or terabytes written, is a manufacturer's stated estimate of how much total data a drive can reliably write over its lifetime before performance may degrade. Not every listing provides this figure, but when one does, like the 1024TBW rating on the fanxiang pick in this comparison, it gives you something concrete to compare against your actual expected usage, rather than relying on vague reliability language. A drive without a stated TBW isn't necessarily less durable, but you have less to verify that claim against."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Encryption Software Becomes More Relevant as Capacity Grows",
    "explanation": "A 2TB drive holds meaningfully more sensitive data than a smaller drive simply by virtue of storing more files, making built-in encryption software, like the 256-bit AES encryption on the Lexar pick in this comparison, a more consequential feature at this capacity tier than it might be on a small transfer drive. If you're storing client work, financial records, or other sensitive material at this capacity, prioritize a listing that explicitly names an encryption feature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Brand Premium Isn't Always Backed by a Specs Advantage",
    "explanation": "At this price tier, an established brand name doesn't automatically come with faster speed or more features, in this comparison, the branded Sandisk pick costs more than both a faster and a slower alternative without a clear specs win in either direction. This means paying more for brand recognition at 2TB is a legitimate but explicit tradeoff, not something you should assume comes bundled with better performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Physical Carry Features Matter More at Higher Capacities",
    "explanation": "A drive holding 2TB of irreplaceable files is worth protecting during actual transport, not just during use, which is why features like a rubber carry hook for a belt loop or bag, as seen on the Sandisk pick in this comparison, become more relevant here than on a smaller everyday-carry drive. If your 2TB drive will regularly travel with you, weigh physical attachment options alongside the core speed and capacity specs."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a Gen 2x2 drive's 2000MB/s speed worth paying for if my laptop only has a standard USB-C port?", "a": "Only partially. If your laptop's port doesn't support the full 20Gbps Gen 2x2 standard, you'll still get a real speed benefit over a slower drive, but you won't reach the full advertised 2000MB/s. Check your laptop's actual port specification before assuming you'll see the full rated speed." },
  { "q": "What does a 1024TBW rating actually mean for how long my drive will last?", "a": "TBW estimates total data written over the drive's useful life before performance may start to decline, not a hard failure point. A 1024TBW rating means you could write roughly 1024 terabytes total, which for most users represents years of typical daily use, though heavy, continuous write workloads would reach that figure faster." },
  { "q": "Should I pay extra for a Sandisk or Samsung 2TB drive over a lesser-known brand with similar specs?", "a": "It depends on your risk tolerance and past experience. In this comparison, the branded Sandisk 2TB pick doesn't outperform the cheaper, faster fanxiang alternative on speed, so the extra cost is mainly buying brand track record and support history rather than better raw capability." },
  { "q": "Do I need encryption software on a portable SSD, or can I add it myself later?", "a": "You can add third-party encryption software to most drives yourself, but built-in encryption like the Lexar pick's 256-bit AES feature is typically easier to set up and manage than configuring a separate tool. If security is a priority and you'd rather not configure it manually, prioritize a drive with the feature built in." },
  { "q": "Why do some 2TB drives include a carry hook or belt loop attachment?", "a": "This is aimed at buyers, like professional photographers, who need to physically secure a valuable drive during travel or fieldwork rather than just carrying it loose in a bag. If your drive stays on a desk most of the time, this feature matters less than the core speed and capacity specs." },
  { "q": "Is 2TB overkill for most people, or is 1TB usually enough?", "a": "It depends on your file types and workflow. For general document and photo storage, 1TB is often plenty, but for video editing, large game libraries, or extensive RAW photo archives, 2TB provides meaningfully more comfortable headroom without needing to manage storage as actively." }
