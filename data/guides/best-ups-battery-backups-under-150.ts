export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "ECO Mode Only Saves Energy on Specifically Designated Outlets, Not the Entire UPS",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower EC850LCD's ECO Mode specifically applies to 3 of its 12 outlets, automatically cutting power to peripherals connected to those specific outlets when the computer is detected as off or sleeping, while the other 9 outlets continue operating normally regardless of computer state. This means the actual energy savings depend on which devices you connect to the ECO-controlled outlets specifically, and connecting your most power-hungry peripheral to a non-ECO outlet would miss out on the feature's benefit entirely. Check which specific outlets are ECO-controlled and plan your device connections accordingly to actually realize the energy savings this feature offers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Data Line Telephone Protection Addresses a Vulnerability Distinct From AC Surge Protection",
    "explanation": "The CyberPower AVRG900LCD's data line protection specifically guards against surges traveling through telephone lines, a genuinely different entry point for electrical damage than the AC outlets every UPS in this comparison protects. This matters specifically if you still use a landline phone or DSL modem connection, since a surge entering through that phone line could damage connected equipment even with excellent AC surge protection in place. Check whether your setup includes any telephone line connections before assuming AC-only surge protection covers every vulnerability in your equipment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Documented Replacement Battery Model Number Signals Genuine Long-Term Serviceability Planning",
    "explanation": "Both APC picks in this comparison specifically name their exact replacement battery models, APCRBC110 for the 650VA unit and RBC17 for the 550VA unit, letting you plan ahead for eventual battery replacement with confidence about compatibility, while a UPS without this specific documentation leaves more uncertainty about whether a suitable replacement battery will be available when needed. This matters for the total cost of ownership over the unit's life, since a UPS with clear replacement battery support avoids becoming disposable once the original battery degrades after several years of use. Check for a specific named replacement battery model rather than vague language about battery replaceability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Doubling Battery-Backup Outlet Count Genuinely Changes How Many Critical Devices Stay Powered Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The AVRG900LCD's 6 battery-backup outlets provide meaningfully more simultaneous outage protection than the 4 battery-backup outlets on either APC pick in this comparison, letting you protect more critical devices, a computer, a monitor, a router, and a modem, all through battery backup rather than needing to prioritize which devices get that protection. This matters directly if your home office setup includes more than 4 devices you'd want to keep running during an outage. Count your actual critical devices needing battery backup specifically, not just total device count, before assuming a lower battery-backup outlet count will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Higher Documented Connected Equipment Warranty at This Tier Reflects Genuine Confidence in More Capable Hardware",
    "explanation": "The AVRG900LCD's $200,000 Connected Equipment Guarantee is double the $100,000 coverage on the EC850LCD despite both being CyberPower products with LCD panels, suggesting the higher-capacity unit's manufacturer backs it with correspondingly stronger financial assurance. This matters most if you're protecting genuinely expensive equipment, a gaming PC, professional monitors, or networking gear supporting a home business, where the cost of potential damage justifies weighing this documented protection level more heavily in your decision. Compare the specific warranty dollar amount against the actual replacement value of what you're protecting."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the CyberPower EC850LCD's ECO Mode work on all 12 of its outlets?", "a": "No, ECO Mode specifically applies to 3 of the 6 surge-only outlets, so only devices connected to those specific ECO-controlled outlets benefit from the automatic power-cutting feature when your computer is off or sleeping." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing battery-backup outlet counts?", "a": "Focusing on total outlet count rather than the specific battery-backup outlet count, when a UPS with more total outlets but the same or fewer battery-backup outlets doesn't actually protect more critical devices during an outage." },
  { "q": "Is the CyberPower AVRG900LCD worth the price premium over the CyberPower EC850LCD?", "a": "If you need the highest capacity, the most battery-backup outlets, and telephone line data protection, yes, but if genuine ECO Mode energy savings matter more to you at a lower price, the EC850LCD delivers that specific feature the AVRG900LCD doesn't emphasize." },
  { "q": "How do I know which specific replacement battery to buy when my APC UPS eventually needs one?", "a": "Check the specific model number stated in the product listing, such as APCRBC110 for the 650VA unit or RBC17 for the 550VA unit, and search for that exact replacement battery model rather than a generic UPS battery." },
  { "q": "Do I need data line telephone protection if I only use a cell phone and cable internet?", "a": "If you don't have a landline phone or DSL modem connection running through a telephone line, this specific protection feature won't provide any practical benefit, so a pick without it would serve your needs just as well." },
  { "q": "Can I add more battery-backup outlets to a UPS after purchase if I need more than it provides?", "a": "No, the battery-backup outlet count is a fixed hardware feature of each specific UPS model, so if you need more battery-backed outlets than your current unit provides, you'd need to choose a different UPS model with a higher battery-backup outlet count from the start." }
