export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your desk can actually grip the mounting base before comparing arms",
    "explanation": "A monitor arm's clamp or grommet base needs a solid desk edge to grip securely, and this is the real first question to answer before comparing gas spring tension or weight capacity, since a hollow honeycomb-core desktop, a glass top, or a desk under about an inch thick can rule out an entire category of arms regardless of how good the arm itself is.\n\nThis matters because discovering after purchase that your desk simply can't mount the arm you bought is a common and entirely avoidable problem.\n\nCheck your desk's actual edge thickness and construction (solid, hollow-core, or glass), and confirm the arm's clamp or grommet base is explicitly rated for that construction before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check real per-arm weight capacity, not the bundled-stand weight printed on the monitor box",
    "explanation": "Monitor weight ratings printed on the box often reference the monitor's included stand, not the bare panel weight relevant to a monitor arm, and a monitor arm's real weight capacity needs to match your specific monitor's actual panel weight without its stand, information usually found in the monitor's separate spec sheet rather than the box itself.\n\nThis matters directly for a larger or ultrawide monitor, where the gap between stand-inclusive and bare-panel weight can be substantial enough to matter.\n\nCheck your monitor's bare panel weight (without its stand) in its official spec sheet, and compare that specifically against the arm's rated capacity, not a generalized weight class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify VESA compatibility for both your monitor and the arm's mounting plate",
    "explanation": "VESA mounting patterns come in a few standard sizes (75x75mm and 100x100mm are most common), and a mismatch between your monitor's VESA pattern and the arm's mounting plate means the arm simply won't attach, some arms include an adapter for multiple patterns while others support only one.\n\nThis matters directly for a monitor with a non-standard or larger VESA pattern, particularly some ultrawide or curved monitors, where assuming universal compatibility can lead to an unusable purchase.\n\nCheck your monitor's specific VESA pattern in its spec sheet, and confirm the arm explicitly supports that pattern, either natively or with an included adapter, before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand gas spring tension and how it affects long-term reliability",
    "explanation": "A gas spring monitor arm relies on an internal pressurized cylinder to hold the monitor at any height with minimal effort, and tension needs to be roughly matched to your monitor's actual weight, a monitor lighter than the spring's calibrated range can drift upward on its own, while pressure calibrated too low for a heavier monitor won't hold position and will slowly droop.\n\nThis matters for long-term usability, not just initial setup, since gas springs can also lose tension gradually over years of use.\n\nCheck the arm's rated weight range against your monitor's actual weight, favoring a monitor that falls comfortably within the middle of that range rather than at either extreme."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider reach and range of motion against your actual desk depth and seating position",
    "explanation": "An arm's horizontal reach and vertical range of motion determine how far the monitor can extend from the mounting point and how much height adjustment is available, and these dimensions matter differently depending on your desk depth and how far back you sit, a shallow desk needs less reach than a deep one, and a standing desk that changes height throughout the day needs a wider vertical range to stay at eye level.\n\nThis matters more for anyone switching between sitting and standing regularly, less for a fixed single seated position.\n\nCheck the arm's listed reach and height range against your actual desk depth and how much your seated or standing eye level varies throughout the day."

  {
    q: "How do I know if my desk can fit a monitor arm clamp?",
    a: "Check that your desk underside is flat, solid, and free of a metal rail, cable tray, or drawer frame where the clamp needs to sit, and confirm the desktop is at least 1 inch thick. A hollow honeycomb-core desktop can look solid but dent under a hard clamp, so tighten gradually and check for give before fully seating it. If your desk is glass or has no clampable edge, a standard clamp mount will not work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to match the monitor arm's weight rating to my monitor's listed weight?",
    a: "Not exactly. The weight printed on your monitor's box or listing includes its factory stand, which is typically 20-40% of the total once removed. Subtract that before comparing against an arm's rated capacity, a 27\" monitor listed at 12 lbs might only be 8-9 lbs on the panel alone, comfortably within a budget arm like the ErGear or WALI pick rather than requiring a heavy-duty arm.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my monitor arm droop after a year or two?",
    a: "Gas spring and mechanical spring arms both lose tension over time with repeated daily height and angle adjustments. Most arms, including the Ergotron LX and LX Pro, have a tension adjustment screw at the joint that can restore proper hold. Check your specific model's manual for the retensioning procedure before assuming the arm needs replacing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does 'full motion' actually mean on a monitor arm?",
    a: "'Full motion' marketing often emphasizes horizontal swivel and does not always guarantee a wide vertical tilt range. Check the stated tilt degrees specifically, arms like the Ergotron LX typically list a real tilt range (roughly 5 to 90 degrees), rather than assuming the phrase covers every direction equally.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a monitor arm worth buying for a small or single monitor setup?",
    a: "It depends on your monitor's size and your desk. A monitor under 21 inches and under 3kg usually balances fine on its stock stand, so an arm mainly adds ergonomic flexibility rather than solving a real problem. If your monitor is 24 inches or larger, or you frequently adjust height and angle through the day, an arm like the budget ErGear or WALI pick becomes worth the cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a monitor arm on a standing desk?",
    a: "Yes, but confirm the cable has enough slack for repeated height changes and that the clamp or grommet base is secure enough to handle the desk moving daily, not just the monitor. A gas spring arm like the Ergotron LX generally handles the added stress of a standing desk's height cycling better than a lighter-duty mechanical spring arm.",
