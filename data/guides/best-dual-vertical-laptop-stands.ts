It is the most affordable dual-slot aluminum stand with independent per-slot adjustment and a lifetime warranty.

A genuine advantage here is that two independent adjustable slots. The tradeoff is narrower range per slot than single-slot model.",

  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best dual vertical laptop stands (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best dual vertical laptop stands (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best dual vertical laptop stands (2026) over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best dual vertical laptop stands (2026) you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best dual vertical laptop stands (2026) that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Do both slots need to hold the same size laptop?", a: "No. Stands with independent per-slot adjustment (OMOTON dual, Psitek dual, UGREEN dual) let each slot hold a different size device. You can store a thin MacBook Air in one slot and a thicker 15-inch Windows laptop in the other at the same time." },
  { q: "How do I choose between a dual stand and two single stands?", a: "A dual stand takes less desk space than two single stands and costs less than buying two singles at similar quality. Two singles offer more placement flexibility if the devices are on opposite sides of the desk. For most desk setups, a dual stand is the more efficient choice." },
  { q: "What is the maximum laptop size for dual stands?", a: "Most dual vertical stands in this roundup hold laptops up to 17 inches per slot. The limiting factor is usually slot width (for device thickness) rather than height, since devices of different heights all fit in the vertical orientation." },
  { q: "Can I mix a laptop and a tablet in a dual stand?", a: "Yes. Tablets like iPad Pro are typically 0.23 to 0.25 inches thick, well within the minimum slot width of all stands in this roundup. Most users with a dual stand store a laptop in one slot and an iPad or second device in the other." },
  { q: "Is a 4-in-1 stand better than a dual stand?", a: "A 4-in-1 organizer stores more devices but the phone and tablet slots are often smaller fixed-width openings. If you only need two laptop slots, a dual stand is more stable and purpose-built. If you genuinely need to store four devices, the Vaydeer 4-in-1 is the practical choice." }
