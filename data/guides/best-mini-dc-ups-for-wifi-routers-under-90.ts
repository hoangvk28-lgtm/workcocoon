export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Confirm whether your device needs passive PoE, active PoE, or neither",
    explanation: "PoE (Power over Ethernet) comes in two incompatible flavors: passive PoE, an older, simpler standard that just injects a fixed voltage onto unused Ethernet wire pairs, and active PoE (the IEEE 802.3af/at standard), which negotiates power delivery electronically and is used by most modern PoE security cameras and access points. A mini UPS built for passive PoE, as at least one listing in this comparison explicitly states, will not properly power a device that requires active 802.3af/at negotiation, even though both use the same RJ45 connector. Check your specific device's documentation or its power adapter's label for \"passive PoE\" or \"802.3af/802.3at\" before assuming any PoE-labeled UPS output will work with it."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Understand what LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually trades off",
    explanation: "Most mini UPS units use standard lithium-ion battery cells, but a smaller number use LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) instead, a different chemistry that generally tolerates more full charge-discharge cycles before capacity degrades and runs at a lower internal temperature during use. The tradeoff is physical size: a LiFePO4 battery is typically bulkier than a lithium-ion battery of the same rated capacity, since the chemistry itself is less energy-dense by volume. If you plan to cycle the battery frequently over several years (repeated outages in an area with unreliable power), the longer cycle life of LiFePO4 is worth the larger footprint; for occasional backup use, standard lithium-ion is a reasonable and more compact choice."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Add up your actual connected device wattage against the unit's max rating",
    explanation: "Every mini UPS lists a maximum total output wattage, and exceeding it, by connecting multiple devices whose combined power draw is higher than that rating, can cause the unit to shut down protectively or fail to deliver stable power to any connected device. Your router's and modem's individual wattage is usually printed on their own power adapters (for example, \"12V 1A\" works out to roughly 12 watts). Add up the wattage of everything you plan to connect simultaneously and compare it against the UPS's stated max output before assuming a single unit can back up multiple devices at once."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check whether status feedback is a real screen or just an indicator light",
    explanation: "Some mini UPS units include a small LCD screen showing an actual battery percentage and which outputs are currently active, while most rely on a simpler LED light that only signals a rough state (fully charged, low, or running on battery) through color or blink pattern. An LCD screen gives you more precise, actionable information, useful if you want to know exactly how much runtime is left during an extended outage rather than just a vague \"battery low\" signal. This is a genuine convenience difference worth a few extra dollars if you'll be checking status regularly, though it doesn't affect the unit's actual backup performance."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Decide if you need single-device or multi-device simultaneous backup",
    explanation: "Most mini UPS units in this category are built with a router or modem in mind as a single device, offering one or two output ports at each voltage, while a smaller number explicitly state dual-device support with duplicate ports at the same voltage so a router and a separate modem can both draw power at once. If your home network setup uses a single combined modem-router gateway device, single-device support covers you fully. If you have genuinely separate modem and router units that both need backup power, check specifically for a listing that states dual simultaneous device support and confirms enough total wattage headroom for both."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "What's the difference between passive PoE and the PoE my security camera uses?",
    a: "Passive PoE injects a fixed voltage onto the Ethernet cable with no negotiation, while most modern PoE security cameras use the IEEE 802.3af/at standard, which negotiates power electronically. These two are not interchangeable: a passive-PoE-only mini UPS will not properly power an 802.3af/at camera, so check your camera's specific PoE type before buying."
  },
  {
    q: "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry worth paying more for?",
    a: "It depends on how often you expect to cycle the battery. LiFePO4 generally handles more full charge-discharge cycles over its lifetime and runs cooler than standard lithium-ion, at the cost of being physically bulkier for the same capacity. For occasional backup use during infrequent outages, standard lithium-ion is a reasonable, more compact choice."
  },
  {
    q: "Can one of these units power both my modem and my router at the same time?",
    a: "Only if it's specifically built for it. Most units in this comparison are designed around a single device, while one pick explicitly states dual simultaneous device support with duplicate output ports. Check the specific listing for that language before assuming any unit here supports two devices at once."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if my router's power needs exceed a unit's max wattage rating?",
    a: "Check your router's power adapter label for its wattage (often shown as voltage times amperage, like \"12V 1A\" for roughly 12 watts). Add up the wattage of every device you plan to connect at once and compare that total against the mini UPS's stated maximum output rating before buying."
  },
  {
    q: "Do these units work as regular power banks when I'm not using them for backup?",
    a: "Several picks in this comparison explicitly double as a standard USB power bank via their USB output ports when they're not actively backing up networking equipment. Check the specific listing's USB output rating to confirm how fast it'll charge a phone or tablet."
  },
  {
    q: "Will my router restart when the mini UPS switches to battery power?",
    a: "It depends on the specific unit's switchover speed. At least one pick in this comparison specifically states a zero-second switchover with no restart needed, while others don't make that claim explicitly. If avoiding any restart is important to you, prioritize a listing that states this directly."
