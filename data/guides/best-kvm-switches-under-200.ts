export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Independent KVM and USB Switching Solves a Specific Professional Workflow Problem",
    "explanation": "Most KVM switches move your keyboard, mouse, and USB peripherals to whichever computer you switch your display to, but the ATEN CS1922 in this comparison allows independently pointing KVM control at one computer while USB peripheral focus stays on a different one. This matters specifically for workflows like transferring a file from one active computer to another, where you'd otherwise need to fully switch back and forth repeatedly, a genuinely specialized capability most buyers won't need but professionals managing complex multi-system workflows will find valuable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Stream Transport Lets One DisplayPort Connection Drive Multiple Monitors",
    "explanation": "Multi-Stream Transport (MST) is a DisplayPort feature that allows a single DisplayPort output to carry the signal for multiple daisy-chained monitors, rather than needing one dedicated cable per monitor. A KVM switch supporting MST, like the ATEN CS1922 in this comparison, can potentially reduce cable complexity for a multi-monitor setup, though actual monitor daisy-chaining also requires monitors that themselves support MST pass-through, so check monitor compatibility alongside the switch's support."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 15-in-1 Docking Station's Port Count Only Matters if You'll Actually Use Those Ports",
    "explanation": "The JCYMELE pick's comprehensive port list, Gigabit Ethernet, SD and Micro SD card slots, multiple USB standards, represents genuine added value only if your actual workflow uses these specific connections. If you don't use an SD card reader or need wired Ethernet, paying for a comprehensive docking station over a simpler KVM switch with fewer ports means paying for capability you won't exercise, so honestly assess your actual port usage before choosing based on port count alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirmed Laptop Compatibility Lists Are More Trustworthy Than Generic 'Universal Compatibility' Claims",
    "explanation": "The JCYMELE pick in this comparison provides a specific compatibility list naming HP EliteBook and Omen series, Dell XPS and Latitude series, Lenovo ThinkPad and Yoga series, and other named models, rather than a vague claim of working with \"any USB-C laptop.\" This level of specific, checkable detail is a stronger trust signal, since USB-C's DisplayPort Alt Mode support varies meaningfully across manufacturers and models despite all technically using the same USB-C connector."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Apple Silicon Macs Frequently Have Display Limitations on USB-C KVM Switches, Even at This Price",
    "explanation": "Multiple picks in this comparison, even at the professional $200 price tier, explicitly note that Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) MacBooks are limited to mirrored dual-monitor output rather than genuine extended displays, a macOS-level limitation rather than a switch hardware failure. If you specifically need extended (not mirrored) dual-monitor output from a MacBook, this limitation persists even on premium hardware, so verify this specific behavior for your exact MacBook model rather than assuming a higher price solves it."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the practical use case for independent KVM and USB switching on the ATEN CS1922?", "a": "It's most useful for workflows like transferring files between two computers, where you want your mouse and keyboard control pointed at one system while a shared USB drive or peripheral stays connected to a different system, avoiding the need to fully switch back and forth repeatedly." },
  { "q": "Can the JCYMELE's triple-monitor mode work with any laptop, or does it require specific hardware?", "a": "It requires a laptop with a USB-C port supporting DisplayPort Alt Mode and data transmission, or Thunderbolt 3/4/5 ports specifically; the listing provides a detailed compatibility list of confirmed laptop models from major manufacturers to check against." },
  { "q": "Does Multi-Stream Transport work with any monitor, or do the monitors also need to support it?", "a": "For true MST daisy-chaining of multiple monitors from a single output, the monitors themselves generally need to support MST pass-through as well; without this monitor-side support, MST mainly benefits driving one high-resolution monitor from a single connection rather than chaining multiple displays." },
  { "q": "Why does the AV Access switch limit Apple Silicon MacBooks to mirrored rather than extended displays?", "a": "This is a limitation in how macOS handles certain external display configurations through USB-C KVM switches at the operating system level, not a hardware defect specific to this switch; it affects multiple KVM switches in this price range similarly when used with Apple Silicon MacBooks." },
  { "q": "Is the ATEN US3311's compact single-monitor design actually missing anything important compared to the full docking stations?", "a": "It lacks the Gigabit Ethernet port and SD card reader found on the JCYMELE and AV Access docks, but it matches or exceeds their charging wattage and resolution capability, making it a reasonable choice if you don't specifically need wired networking or card reading built into the switch." },
  { "q": "Can I connect more than two computers to any of the switches in this comparison?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison are 2-computer switches; if you need to manage more than two computers simultaneously, our under $150 guide covers a 4-computer, 3-monitor option at a lower price than these professional 2-computer docking switches." }
