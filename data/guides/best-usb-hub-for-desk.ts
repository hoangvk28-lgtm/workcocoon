export const faq: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
  {
    q: "Do I need a powered USB hub for a mechanical keyboard and mouse?",
    a: "No -- keyboards and mice draw very little power (under 100mA each). An unpowered 4-port hub handles keyboard + mouse + wireless receiver + one more accessory without issues. You only need a powered hub when connecting external drives, charging devices, or running 5+ peripherals simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a USB hub to charge my phone faster?",
    a: "Depends on the hub. Standard USB 3.0 data ports deliver 900mA (about 5W) -- this charges a phone slowly. Look for a hub with a dedicated charging port: BC 1.2 (Anker 7-port), PowerIQ (Anker 10-port), or smart charging (Sabrent 10-port). These deliver 2-2.4A (10-12W) to phones, meaningfully faster.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a USB hub slow down my internet if I connect a mouse or keyboard to it?",
    a: "No. USB hubs don't affect Wi-Fi or ethernet. They share the USB bandwidth of the port they connect to (5 Gbps for USB 3.0), but keyboard and mouse data is negligible -- a full keyboard dataset is less than 1MB/s even during heavy typing. No measurable impact on transfer speed for other devices.",
  },
  {
    q: "My external hard drive keeps disconnecting from the hub -- why?",
    a: "Almost certainly an unpowered hub. External hard drives require 900mA-1.5A on startup (spin-up current) -- more than most unpowered hubs can deliver from the laptop's USB port. The drive powers on, demands more current than available, and disconnects. Solution: use a powered hub with its own AC adapter. The Anker 7-port (#1) and both 10-port options (#2, #6) handle this reliably.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I daisy-chain USB hubs?",
    a: "Technically yes -- USB supports up to 5 tiers. Practically, each tier adds latency and reduces total available bandwidth. For stable desk use, don't chain more than two hubs. One powered hub connected directly to your laptop is always preferable to a chain.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a USB hub and a USB docking station?",
    a: "A USB hub expands USB ports only. A docking station adds display outputs (HDMI, DisplayPort), ethernet, SD card reader, and audio -- plus USB ports -- all from one cable. If you need a monitor output alongside more USB ports, look at docking stations. If you only need more USB ports, a hub is simpler and cheaper.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do USB hubs work with Mac and PC?",
    a: "Yes -- all hubs on this list are plug-and-play on Windows (7/10/11), macOS, Chrome OS, and Linux. No driver installation needed. The USB standard is universal.",
