  "Starlink's proprietary cable often isn't long enough to reach an ideal mounting spot with a clear sky view, and rather than cutting or splicing the expensive original cable, a dedicated coupler lets you join a second cable to extend your reach without voiding anything or risking damage.",
  "We compared this lineup on connector type, since Starlink actually uses two different cables depending on the model, an Ethernet-style RJ45 cable on Standard/Gen 3 dishes and a DC barrel power cable on the Mini, so the right extender depends entirely on which Starlink model and cable type you actually have."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Starlink Uses Two Genuinely Different Cable Types Depending on the Dish Model, Requiring the Correct Coupler",
    "explanation": "The Standard and Gen 3 Starlink dishes use an RJ45-style Ethernet cable, while the Starlink Mini uses a 5.5mm by 2.1mm DC barrel power cable, meaning an Ethernet coupler like the Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit and a DC coupler like the RVSPARK adapter are not interchangeable despite both being marketed as 'Starlink extenders.' This matters significantly since buying the wrong connector type for your specific dish model simply won't work at all, regardless of how well-reviewed or well-built the product is. Verify your exact Starlink model and cable connector type before purchasing any extender, rather than assuming any 'Starlink extender' product matches your specific dish."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Coupler Specifically Matched to the Original Cable's Gasket Provides a More Reliable Weatherproof Seal",
    "explanation": "The LYANSO pick specifically states it's designed to perfectly match the Starlink cable's original rubber gasket, creating a seamless seal, a more precisely engineered fit than a generic coupler that achieves waterproofing through its own separate housing design alone. This matters if your installation faces genuine sustained outdoor weather exposure like rooftop mounting, where a precisely matched gasket seal provides more reliable long-term protection, and matters less for a sheltered or temporary indoor test setup. Check whether a coupler specifically states gasket compatibility with your exact Starlink cable model if long-term outdoor weatherproofing is a priority."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Explicit 'Not Lightning Protected' Disclosure Is an Honest Limitation Worth Knowing Before Rooftop Installation",
    "explanation": "The Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit specifically discloses that it is not lightning protected, an honest limitation that matters if your rooftop installation is in an area with genuine lightning strike risk, since this coupler alone won't provide surge protection beyond what your existing Starlink setup already includes. This matters significantly for a high, exposed rooftop mount in a storm-prone region, and matters less for a lower, more sheltered mounting location. Consider whether your specific installation location's lightning risk warrants additional surge protection beyond what any of these couplers explicitly provide, since none in this comparison specifically claim lightning protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual LED Connection Indicators Provide Real Troubleshooting Value for a Connection You Can't Easily See Once Installed",
    "explanation": "The STARGEAR pick's specifically named dual blue LED power indicators glow to confirm a proper connection on both sides, a genuinely useful troubleshooting aid for a coupler that might be installed somewhere hard to visually inspect once in place, like inside a wall conduit or a weatherproof outdoor enclosure. This matters if your installation location makes it difficult to physically verify the connection after installation, and matters less for an easily accessible connection point you can inspect directly at any time. Check for a stated visual or audible connection confirmation feature if your specific installation location will be hard to physically re-inspect after setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Broader Stated Compatibility With Third-Party PoE Equipment Adds Real Flexibility Beyond Just Starlink's Own Ecosystem",
    "explanation": "The Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit specifically states compatibility with third-party PoE injectors from Ubiquiti and TP-Link in addition to Starlink hardware, meaning the same coupler could serve a broader home networking setup beyond just extending your Starlink cable. This matters if you're also running other PoE equipment in your network and want a single compatible coupler solution across multiple devices, and matters less if your only use case is strictly extending the Starlink cable itself. Check whether a coupler's stated compatibility extends beyond Starlink-specific hardware if you anticipate using it with other PoE equipment as well."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use the same coupler for a Starlink Standard dish and a Starlink Mini?", "a": "No, the Standard and Gen 3 dishes use an RJ45 Ethernet cable while the Mini uses a DC barrel power cable, so you need the correct coupler type, like the Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit for Ethernet cables or the RVSPARK adapter for the Mini's power cord, matched to your specific dish model." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Starlink cable extender?", "a": "Assuming any 'Starlink extender' product works with any Starlink dish, when the Standard/Gen 3 and Mini models use genuinely different cable connector types that require different, non-interchangeable couplers." },
  { "q": "Is the Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit worth the higher price over the LYANSO coupler?", "a": "If you want the broadest compatibility across Starlink generations and third-party PoE equipment plus an extreme temperature rating, the Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit's higher price is justified, but for a straightforward extension matched to your exact dish model, the LYANSO pick offers strong value at a lower price." },
  { "q": "Will extending my Starlink cable with a coupler reduce my internet speed?", "a": "The Ethernet couplers in this comparison specifically state they maintain full 1000Mbps speed with lossless transmission, so a properly installed, quality coupler should not noticeably reduce your speed within its rated distance." },
  { "q": "Are these couplers actually waterproof for rooftop or long-term outdoor installation?", "a": "The picks in this comparison carry IP67 or IP68 ratings, genuine waterproof certifications suited to rooftop and long-term outdoor use, though checking the specific rating and whether it matches your installation's actual weather exposure is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Do I need a lightning-protected coupler for a rooftop Starlink installation?", "a": "The Starlink Ethernet Adapter Kit specifically discloses it is not lightning protected, so if your rooftop installation faces genuine lightning risk, you may want to research additional surge protection separate from any of these couplers." }
