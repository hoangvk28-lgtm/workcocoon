  "A desktop whiteboard's surface material matters more than its listed size once you account for the frame border eating into usable writing area. Melamine surfaces tend to \"ghost\" (retain faint marker residue) after repeated use, while porcelain and glass resist ghosting far longer, a spec most general roundups never decode, so we noted the material for each pick below where the listing states it.",
  "Freestanding desktop whiteboards depend on their stand holding steady while you actually write on them, not just while sitting on a shelf for a photo. Listing data can't confirm stand stability under real writing pressure, so treat that as a buyer-advisory check worth reading current reviews for before buying, especially for glass boards where any wobble is more noticeable.",
