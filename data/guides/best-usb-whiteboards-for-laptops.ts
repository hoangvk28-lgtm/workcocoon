  "The phrase \"USB whiteboard\" is genuinely ambiguous. It could mean a literal digital device that connects to your laptop over USB, or it could simply describe searchers wanting a compact physical whiteboard to sit next to their laptop on a desk. In our research pass, we found no genuine USB-connected digital whiteboard devices, real products in that category exist but are a rare, specialized, and considerably more expensive category that wasn't part of this research.",
  "Given that most people searching this phrase are almost certainly looking for a compact physical whiteboard for their laptop desk setup, not an actual USB-connected device, we're covering the most laptop-desk-appropriate physical whiteboards below. To be explicit: these are standard dry erase whiteboards with no USB connection or digital feature, and we're not implying otherwise.",
