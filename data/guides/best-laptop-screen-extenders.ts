export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match the extender's screen size proportionally to your laptop, not just to the biggest option available",
    "explanation": "A screen extender attaches directly alongside your laptop's own display, so its physical size needs to pair proportionally with your laptop's screen rather than simply being as large as possible, since an extender significantly larger or smaller than your laptop's own panel creates a visually unbalanced setup and can make the attachment hardware work harder to support the size difference.\n\nA 13 to 14 inch laptop pairs naturally with a similarly sized 14-inch extender, while a 15.6 or 16-inch laptop balances better with an extender in that same size range.\n\nCheck your own laptop's screen size first, then choose an extender sized to match it rather than assuming a bigger panel is automatically a better upgrade."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that resolution and physical size together determine real sharpness, not either spec alone",
    "explanation": "Two panels advertised at the same 1080P resolution will look noticeably different in sharpness if their physical sizes differ, because the same number of pixels spread across a smaller 14-inch panel produces a higher pixel density, and therefore a visibly crisper image, than the identical pixel count spread across a larger 15.6 or 17-inch panel.\n\nThis means a smaller extender is not automatically a downgrade in visual quality, and buyers chasing the largest available screen size at a fixed resolution should understand they're trading pixel density for physical workspace, a genuine tradeoff rather than a straightforward size-equals-better relationship.\n\nCompare both the stated resolution and the physical panel size together, and calculate or look up the resulting pixel density (pixels per inch) if sharpness matters more to you than raw screen real estate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the connection type actually matches your laptop's available ports",
    "explanation": "Screen extenders connect via USB-C (which can carry both video and power over a single cable on laptops that support USB-C DisplayPort alt mode), HDMI (video only, requiring a separate power cable to the extender), or both, and this isn't just a convenience detail, since a laptop without a USB-C port that supports video output simply cannot drive a USB-C-only extender regardless of how the cable physically connects.\n\nThis is a genuine, easy-to-miss compatibility trap: not every USB-C port on a laptop supports video output (some are power or data only), so having a USB-C port at all doesn't guarantee this specific use case will work.\n\nCheck your specific laptop model's documentation for confirmed USB-C DisplayPort alt mode support, or favor an extender with both USB-C and HDMI options to cover either connection path."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the attachment mechanism against how you'll actually use the extender day to day",
    "explanation": "Extenders attach to a laptop through a few genuinely different mechanisms, magnetic mounts (quick to attach and remove but rely on magnet strength holding position), clip-on or clamp designs (a firmer physical grip on the laptop lid but slower to attach and remove), or a separate kickstand base (fully independent positioning but adds desk footprint and doesn't travel attached to the laptop).\n\nSomeone who frequently packs up and travels with their setup benefits from a fast magnetic or clip attachment, while someone with a permanent desk setup may prefer a stand-based design that doesn't touch or stress the laptop's own lid hinge at all.\n\nMatch the attachment mechanism to your actual daily routine (frequent travel and reassembly versus a fixed desk setup) rather than defaulting to whichever style looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since panel size categories vary widely in review depth",
    "explanation": "Common laptop screen sizes like 15.6 inches generally have a much larger pool of dedicated extenders and far more accumulated reviews than less common sizes like 17-inch or specialty categories like touchscreen or 4K extenders, which means a high star rating on a niche-size listing often rests on a meaningfully smaller review sample than the same rating on a mainstream-size product.\n\nThis matters because a thin review base, even a positive one, gives less confidence about long-term reliability (hinge durability, cable connector wear, panel defect rates) than a rating built on thousands of purchases across diverse use cases.\n\nWhen comparing extenders, especially at a less common size or in a specialty category, check both the star rating and the review count together rather than trusting the rating figure alone."
