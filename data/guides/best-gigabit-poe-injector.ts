export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Passive PoE and Standard 802.3af/at PoE Are Not Interchangeable Power Delivery Methods",
    "explanation": "Passive PoE simply applies a fixed voltage to specific wire pairs without any negotiation with the connected device, while 802.3af/at standard PoE performs a handshake to detect the device and deliver the correct wattage safely, and connecting a passive-PoE-only injector to a device expecting standard negotiation (or vice versa) can fail to power the device or, in rare cases, cause damage. This matters specifically for Ubiquiti and MikroTik equipment, much of which uses 48V passive PoE rather than the 802.3af/at standard common on IP cameras and VoIP phones. Check your specific device's documentation for whether it expects passive PoE or standard 802.3af/at PoE before matching it to an injector."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA and TAA Compliance Matters for Institutional Buyers but Adds No Real Value for a Home Network",
    "explanation": "NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) and TAA (Trade Agreements Act) compliance restrict the use of networking equipment from certain manufacturers in U.S. government and government-adjacent procurement, and a compliant injector typically costs a few dollars more for functionally identical Gigabit PoE performance. This matters if you're purchasing for a government contractor, school district, or municipal deployment where procurement policy requires it, and matters not at all for a home or small business network with no such requirement. Check your organization's specific procurement policy before paying extra for compliance you don't actually need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Manufacturer Warranty Reflects Real Confidence in Long-Term Reliability",
    "explanation": "A PoE injector that fails after a year of continuous operation, particularly one powering a security camera you rely on, is a real inconvenience beyond just the replacement cost, and a 3-year manufacturer warranty like TRENDnet states on its Gigabit injectors gives you a documented path to replacement if that happens. This matters more for a permanent installation you don't want to think about again for years, and matters less for a temporary or test setup where a shorter or unstated warranty is an acceptable tradeoff for a lower price. Check the listing's bullet points for an explicit warranty length rather than assuming all injectors carry the same coverage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Explicit Usage Note About Device Compatibility Prevents a Real Mismatch Before You Buy",
    "explanation": "Some PoE injector listings specifically clarify that they only work with true PoE devices and PoE cameras, not cameras that use separate power and data connections, and buying without checking this distinction can mean the injector simply doesn't power your specific camera model even though it's technically a camera. This matters if you're unsure whether your specific device negotiates power over the same Ethernet cable as its data, and matters less if you've already confirmed your device is a standard single-cable PoE device. Read the listing's usage notes and compatibility bullet points carefully, not just the headline wattage and speed specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "LED Connectivity Indicators Provide a Real Diagnostic Advantage During Installation and Troubleshooting",
    "explanation": "An injector with LED indicators lets you visually confirm at a glance whether power and data are flowing correctly, which is genuinely useful when troubleshooting why a connected camera or access point isn't coming online, compared to a unit with no visual feedback at all. This matters more for installations in less accessible locations like ceilings or outdoor enclosures where you want to diagnose a problem without physically disconnecting cables, and matters less for a simple desktop setup where a quick unplug-and-replug test is easy enough. Check the listing's bullet points specifically for a mention of LED indicators if diagnostic visibility matters for your installation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a Gigabit PoE injector necessary for a basic security camera?", "a": "A basic 1080p camera works fine on 100Mbps, but Gigabit ports future-proof the injector for higher-resolution 4K cameras or additional devices you might connect later, and cost only a few dollars more." },
  { "q": "Can I use a standard 802.3af/at injector with a Ubiquiti access point?", "a": "It depends on the specific model; some newer Ubiquiti gear supports standard 802.3af/at PoE, but many use 48V passive PoE instead, so check your specific access point's documentation before assuming compatibility." },
  { "q": "Is NDAA compliance worth paying extra for a home network?", "a": "No, NDAA and TAA compliance only matter for government and government-adjacent procurement policies; a home or small business network gets no functional benefit from paying more for compliant hardware." },
  { "q": "What happens if I use a passive PoE injector with a standard 802.3af device?", "a": "The device may not power on at all since it's waiting for the negotiation handshake standard PoE uses, or in some cases the mismatch can risk damaging the device, so matching the power delivery method correctly matters." },
  { "q": "How long should a Gigabit PoE injector last?", "a": "A quality unit with a stated multi-year manufacturer warranty, like the TRENDnet picks in this comparison, is built for continuous long-term operation, though any electronic device can fail early regardless of warranty length." },
  { "q": "Do I need a Gigabit PoE injector if my switch is already Gigabit?", "a": "Yes, the injector itself must have Gigabit ports independently of your switch, since a Fast Ethernet-only injector placed in the path between your Gigabit switch and device will still bottleneck that connection to 100Mbps." }
