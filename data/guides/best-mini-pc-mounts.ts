  "A Mini PC mount only earns its keep if it solves the problem it was bought for: getting a small computer off the desk without blocking its vents, overloading the surface it attaches to, or making the ports impossible to reach. Before comparing individual products, it helps to separate mounting method from mounting hardware, because a mount rated for under-desk use is not automatically a good wall mount, and a VESA-only bracket cannot substitute for a stud-anchored wall plate.",
  "This guide covers the full mounting category: behind-monitor, under-desk, and wall-mounted options side by side. If you already know you want VESA-specific hardware or a wall-only setup, our narrower guides on VESA mounts and wall mounts dig deeper into those two methods specifically, while this guide is the place to start if you are still deciding which mounting location fits your desk.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify your exact mini PC model against the mount's stated compatibility list",
    "explanation": "Mini PC mounts and brackets are built around specific chassis dimensions and screw-hole patterns, and unlike a universal VESA monitor mount, many mini PC brackets are designed for one specific brand's chassis shape, such as Dell OptiPlex Micro, Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny, HP EliteDesk Mini, or a specific generation of Mac mini.\n\nMounting hardware that doesn't match your exact model can fail to align with the screw holes at all, or worse, only partially secure the device, creating a real risk of it working loose over time in a mount that's supposed to hold it stationary.\n\nCheck the listing's stated compatible models and generations specifically against your own mini PC's exact model number, not just the general \"mini PC\" category claim in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the mount's actual mounting surface (VESA, rack, wall, or under-desk) matches your install location",
    "explanation": "Mini PC mounts split into genuinely different installation categories: VESA mounts attach to the back of a monitor or TV using the standardized VESA hole pattern, rack mounts fit a 10-inch home-lab or 19-inch commercial server rack, wall mounts attach directly to drywall or a stud, and under-desk mounts clamp to the underside of a desk surface, and these are not interchangeable hardware despite all falling under the same general product category.\n\nBuying a rack-format shelf when you actually need a VESA bracket, for instance, means the hardware simply won't attach to your intended surface at all, since the mounting mechanism itself is fundamentally different between categories.\n\nIdentify your specific installation surface first (monitor back, rack, wall, or desk underside) and filter specifically for that mount type, rather than searching generically for \"mini PC mount\" and assuming any result will work for your setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the stated weight capacity against your mini PC's actual weight",
    "explanation": "A mount's weight capacity, when disclosed, reflects how much load the bracket's screws, arms, and adhesive or clamping mechanism can safely hold long-term without gradually sagging, loosening, or failing outright, and mini PCs vary meaningfully in weight depending on their chassis material and internal components, from under a pound for the lightest fanless designs to several pounds for units with larger heatsinks or multiple drive bays.\n\nMounting a device at or near a bracket's rated limit, especially on a mount holding the device at an angle or overhead behind a monitor, leaves little margin for the natural loosening that happens over months of use, vibration, or repeated adjustment.\n\nWeigh your specific mini PC model (check its listed weight spec) against the mount's stated capacity, and favor a mount with meaningful headroom above your device's actual weight rather than one rated right at the edge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider port and cable access after the mount is installed, not just before",
    "explanation": "A mini PC's ports are typically concentrated on the rear and sometimes front panel, and once mounted, especially behind a monitor, inside a rack, or under a desk, those ports can become significantly harder to reach for routine tasks like plugging in a USB drive or checking a status light, even though the mount holds the device perfectly securely.\n\nSome mounts are specifically designed to preserve front-panel port access after installation, while others prioritize a low-profile or flush mount that trades away easy access for a cleaner look, and this is a real day-to-day usability tradeoff that photos alone don't always make obvious.\n\nThink through which ports you'll need to access regularly after mounting (power, a USB drive, HDMI swaps) and check whether the specific mount's design keeps those reachable, rather than only checking that it physically holds the device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what installation hardware is actually included versus what you'll need to source separately",
    "explanation": "Mount listings vary in how complete their included hardware kit is, some ship with every screw, VESA adapter plate, and cable tie needed for a full installation, while others assume you already have compatible mounting screws from the mini PC's original packaging or a previous mount, which isn't always the case if you're mounting a device for the first time or switching setups.\n\nThis matters because discovering mid-installation that you're missing a specific screw size or an adapter plate means a delayed setup and a second order, a genuinely avoidable frustration.\n\nCheck the listing's stated included contents specifically, and if you no longer have your mini PC's original mounting screws, confirm the mount ships with compatible replacements rather than assuming they're included by default."

  { q: "Can any of these mounts go on a wall, under a desk, and behind a monitor?", a: "A few, like the HumanCentric and VIVO brackets and the Adjustable Thin Client mount from this guide, genuinely support all three locations with one hardware kit. Others, like the PUTORSEN and 5-Level Height Adjustable brackets, are under-desk only despite being in the same general category." },
  { q: "Is a drywall anchor strong enough for a wall-mounted Mini PC?", a: "It can hold a very light device for light use, but a stud is the more reliable anchor point for anything left mounted long-term, since drywall anchors are more prone to slow pull-out failure under sustained load or repeated cable tension." },
  { q: "Does a higher weight rating always mean a better mount?", a: "Not for a bare Mini PC, since most only weigh 1 to 3 pounds and any mount here clears that easily. A higher rating matters only if you are adding a docking station, NAS enclosure, or piggybacking on a monitor's VESA point." },
  { q: "Will mounting my Mini PC make it run hotter?", a: "Only if the mount traps its intake or exhaust against a solid surface or an enclosed space. Open-frame mounts with real clearance on multiple sides avoid this problem; a mount pressed into a tight under-desk cubby needs its own clearance check regardless of the bracket's design." },
  { q: "How is this guide different from the VESA mount and wall mount guides on this site?", a: "This guide compares all three mounting methods side by side so you can decide which fits your desk first. Our VESA mount guide and wall mount guide each narrow into one specific method with more depth on that method's particular tradeoffs." },
