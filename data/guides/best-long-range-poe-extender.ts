  "We compared this lineup on documented speed and power output at multiple distance milestones, not just the single best-case maximum range, since one listing specifically states up to 30W at 100Mbps over 300m but drops to 15.4W at just 10Mbps over 800m using the identical hardware."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Long-Range PoE Extender's Real Bandwidth Almost Always Drops Well Before Its Maximum Advertised Distance",
    "explanation": "The Intellinet pick specifically documents up to 30W at 100Mbps over 300m, dropping to just 15.4W at 10Mbps over 800m, a real and substantial reduction that occurs well before the kit's full 1000m maximum range, illustrating that a single headline maximum-distance figure rarely tells the whole story. This matters significantly if your device needs consistent bandwidth at the far end of a long cable run, and matters less if your device only needs a modest, low-bitrate connection regardless of distance. Look for a listing that specifically breaks down bandwidth and power at multiple distance milestones, not just its single best-case maximum range number, before assuming full performance holds throughout."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Direct Burial Rating Is a Distinct, More Specific Claim Than a General Outdoor Waterproof Rating",
    "explanation": "The FASTCALBING pick specifically states a direct burial rated design, meaning the unit itself is built to be buried underground as part of the cable run, a more specific and demanding standard than a general IP67 outdoor rating that assumes the unit sits in open air or a mounted enclosure rather than fully submerged in soil. This matters significantly if your installation plan involves burying the extender itself underground, since a standard outdoor-rated unit not specifically rated for direct burial could fail prematurely in that environment. Check for an explicit direct burial rating rather than assuming a general outdoor IP67 rating covers underground burial use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Explicit Surge Protection Ratings Provide Real, Checkable Assurance Against Electrical Damage in Remote Installations",
    "explanation": "The PROCET pick's specifically stated 6KV surge protection gives a concrete, checkable rating for how much transient voltage spike the unit can absorb before damage occurs, a real safeguard that matters more in remote, elevated, or lightning-prone installations like farms and outdoor stations than in a sheltered urban indoor setting. This matters significantly if you're installing in a location genuinely exposed to electrical surge risk, and matters less for a fully indoor, sheltered installation with stable power. Check whether an extender specifically states a surge protection voltage rating rather than a vague 'built-in protection' claim, if your installation location has real surge exposure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Pairing Mode Removes a Real Configuration Step Compared to a Manually Configured Long-Distance Link",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's Paired Mode activates automatically simply by connecting two units' input ports directly, removing any manual configuration step that a more complex long-distance PoE setup might otherwise require. This matters if you want the simplest possible setup process and don't have networking configuration experience, and matters less if you're comfortable with more manual setup steps in exchange for potentially finer control over the connection. Check whether a long-range extender specifically states automatic pairing or plug-and-play operation if setup simplicity is a priority over manual configuration flexibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wide Operating Temperature Range Matters More Than a Waterproof Rating Alone for Extreme Climate Installations",
    "explanation": "The PROCET pick's specifically stated -40F to 149F operating range is notably wider than the roughly 14F to 131F range on the Intellinet pick, a real difference that matters in climates with genuine temperature extremes beyond what a more modest outdoor rating anticipates. This matters if you're installing in a region with very cold winters or very hot summers, and matters less in a moderate climate where any outdoor-rated unit performs adequately regardless of the exact stated range. Compare an extender's specific operating temperature range, not just its IP waterproof rating, if your installation location experiences genuine temperature extremes."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will I get full Gigabit speed at the maximum distance advertised on a long-range PoE extender?", "a": "Generally no; most long-range extenders in this comparison specifically document reduced bandwidth well before their maximum stated distance, so checking a listing's speed-by-distance breakdown rather than just its headline maximum range figure is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a long-range PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming the maximum advertised distance comes with full bandwidth throughout, when most long-range extenders specifically disclose reduced speed and power well before reaching their absolute maximum documented range." },
  { "q": "Is the Intellinet kit worth the higher price over the FASTCALBING extender?", "a": "If you need the most detailed distance-to-power documentation and the broadest PoE standard support including 802.3bt, the Intellinet's higher price is justified, but if you specifically need a direct burial installation over a shorter distance, the FASTCALBING is the better fit." },
  { "q": "Can I bury a standard outdoor PoE extender underground if it's IP67 rated?", "a": "Not necessarily; an IP67 waterproof rating doesn't automatically mean a unit is rated for direct burial, so checking specifically for a direct burial rating, like the FASTCALBING pick explicitly states, is important before burying any extender underground." },
  { "q": "Do I need surge protection for a PoE extender in a typical suburban home installation?", "a": "Surge protection matters more in remote, elevated, or lightning-prone locations like farms and rural outdoor stations; a typical sheltered suburban installation has lower surge exposure, though the PROCET pick's 6KV protection adds a meaningful safeguard regardless of location." },
  { "q": "Can I chain multiple long-range PoE extenders together to reach an even greater distance?", "a": "Some extenders, like the LINOVISION pick, are specifically designed to pair two units together to reach their maximum documented distance, though chaining beyond the manufacturer's stated configuration isn't guaranteed to work reliably and should be verified against each product's specific documentation." }
