export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "IP67 Alone Doesn't Tell You Everything About an Outdoor Injector's Real Durability",
    "explanation": "IP67 specifically means the enclosure is dust-tight and can withstand temporary immersion in up to 1 meter of water, which covers rain and dust exposure well, but says nothing about resistance to physical impact or vandalism, a separate IK rating (like IK10) that only some listings in this comparison state. This matters if your installation is in a publicly accessible location where physical tampering or accidental impact is a realistic risk, and matters less for a mounted, out-of-reach installation where weather is the only real concern. Check for both an IP rating for weather and dust and, separately, an IK rating if physical protection is also a consideration for your specific installation site."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In Power Supply Versus a Separately Sold Power Supply Changes the Real Total Cost of an Outdoor Injector",
    "explanation": "Some outdoor injector listings, like the FASTCABLING pick, include a built-in 100-240V AC power supply so the stated price is the complete cost, while others, like the TRENDnet pick, sell the power supply as a separate accessory, meaning the listed price doesn't reflect what you'll actually spend to get a working installation. This matters for comparing prices fairly across different listings, since a lower headline price with a separate required accessory purchase can end up costing more than a higher headline price that includes everything needed. Check the listing specifically for whether a power supply is included or sold separately before comparing prices across outdoor injector options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DC Input Flexibility Is Essential for Remote or Solar Installations but Unnecessary Complexity for a Standard Grid-Powered Site",
    "explanation": "An outdoor injector designed to accept a wide DC voltage range with voltage boosting, like the PROCET pick, specifically enables solar panel or battery power for installations without grid electricity access, a genuinely different design purpose from a standard AC-powered unit. This matters significantly for remote PTZ cameras, wireless bridges, or radar signs installed away from existing electrical infrastructure, and matters not at all if your installation site already has standard AC power readily available. Confirm your specific installation site's actual power access before paying for DC input flexibility you won't use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wide Operating Temperature Range Matters More in Extreme Climates Than Moderate Ones",
    "explanation": "The listings in this comparison range from a -25C to 60C operating range up to a -40C to 75C range, and this difference matters significantly if your installation is in a climate with genuine temperature extremes, like far northern winters or desert summers, where a narrower-rated unit could fail to operate reliably or degrade faster over time. This matters less in a moderate climate that rarely approaches either temperature extreme, where any of the outdoor-rated picks in this comparison would perform reliably. Check your local climate's actual temperature extremes against a listing's stated operating range before assuming any IP67-rated unit handles your specific conditions equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included Mounting and Sealing Accessories Reduce Real Installation Complexity and Hidden Costs",
    "explanation": "A listing that includes a mounting kit, earthing kit, and IP67-rated cable glands, like the Intellinet pick, gives you everything needed for a genuinely sealed outdoor installation without sourcing additional parts separately, while a listing without these accessories may leave you needing to purchase compatible glands or grounding hardware on your own to achieve the same weatherproof result. This matters more for a DIY installation where sourcing compatible additional parts adds real time and cost, and matters less if you're working with an installer who already has standard mounting and sealing supplies on hand. Check the listing's included-items section specifically rather than assuming any IP67-rated unit comes complete for installation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the real difference between IP67 and IK10 ratings on an outdoor PoE injector?", "a": "IP67 covers dust and water resistance, including temporary submersion, while IK10 is a separate rating for physical impact and vandal resistance, and a unit can have one rating without the other." },
  { "q": "Can I power an outdoor PoE injector from a solar panel?", "a": "Only if the specific unit is designed for DC input, like the PROCET pick in this comparison; standard AC-powered outdoor injectors cannot accept solar or battery power directly." },
  { "q": "Do I need NDAA compliance for a residential outdoor PoE injector installation?", "a": "No, NDAA and TAA compliance only matter for U.S. government and government-adjacent procurement requirements, and add no functional benefit for a residential or standard commercial installation." },
  { "q": "Is a higher wattage always better for an outdoor PoE injector?", "a": "No, match the injector's power ceiling to your specific device's actual draw; a 95W injector powering a 30W PTZ camera doesn't provide any extra benefit and typically costs more than a correctly matched lower-wattage unit." },
  { "q": "What happens if an outdoor PoE injector's power supply isn't included?", "a": "You'll need to purchase a compatible power supply separately, which adds to the real total cost of the installation beyond the listed injector price, so factor that into your budget comparison." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my climate requires a wider operating temperature range?", "a": "Check your local area's historical extreme low and high temperatures against the injector's stated operating range; a unit rated only to 60C maximum could struggle in an extremely hot desert installation compared to one rated to 75C." }
