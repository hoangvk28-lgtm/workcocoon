export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Open-Back Monitor Clearance Determines Whether the Hutch Actually Fits Your Screen",
    "explanation": "The open-back compartment on a desk hutch is the cutout space behind the lower shelf where your monitor sits, and its stated width and height directly determine whether your specific screen fits without being blocked or forced too close to your face. A hutch rated for a 24 inch monitor, like the Furinno pick, may not leave enough clearance for a 27 or 32 inch ultrawide, even though both are technically called desk hutches. Check the listing for exact clearance dimensions in inches, not just a marketing phrase like 'fits most monitors', and measure your own monitor's width and stand height before assuming any hutch in this comparison fits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated Weight Capacity Per Shelf Matters More Than a Single Total Capacity Number",
    "explanation": "Some listings state a single total weight capacity for the whole unit, like the Furinno pick's 50 lb total, while others state capacity per shelf without a combined total, which makes direct comparison tricky if you're planning to load every shelf near its limit simultaneously. This matters concretely if you're storing dense items like textbooks or a small printer on one shelf, since a shelf rated for 10 lbs sags or fails well before a total-unit rating would suggest. Look for both the per-shelf and total figures in the listing bullet points, and plan your heaviest items for whichever shelf has the highest individual rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Anti-Tip Hardware Is Not Standard Across This Category and Should Be Verified, Not Assumed",
    "explanation": "Anti-tip straps or anchors are small hardware pieces that secure a top-heavy hutch to a wall or desk to prevent it from tipping forward when a top shelf is loaded unevenly, and not every desk hutch at this price includes them. The Furinno and Giantex picks both specifically call out anti-tip hardware in their listings, while others in this price range may skip it entirely. This matters more for taller, narrower hutches or households with children who might pull on shelves, so check the listing's feature bullets for the words 'anti-tip' or 'anti-toppling' rather than assuming standard hardware is included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hidden Drawer Storage Changes What You Can Practically Store Versus Open Shelving Alone",
    "explanation": "A hidden drawer, like the fabric one on the Marbrasse pick, is meant for smaller or personal items you don't want visibly displayed, such as chargers, medication, or paperwork, while open shelves work better for books, decor, or a monitor riser that benefit from easy visual access. This matters if your desk hutch will sit somewhere visible to roommates, family, or video call backgrounds, where open-only shelving leaves everything on display. Check whether a listing mentions a drawer explicitly versus just 'compartments' or 'cubbies', since those terms usually mean open storage rather than a closeable drawer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Assembly Complexity and Included Hardware Vary Enough to Matter for a First-Time Buyer",
    "explanation": "Desk hutches in this price range range from tool-free, pre-drilled assembly taking under 15 minutes, like the Nova Microdermabrasion pick, to multi-step builds requiring around 30 minutes with labeled parts, like the Furinno pick. This matters if you're assembling furniture without help or tools on hand, since a tool-free design avoids the need to track down a screwdriver or hex key for a single piece of furniture. Check the listing's stated assembly time and whether it specifies 'tool-free' or lists required tools before assuming any two hutches take the same effort to set up."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does a desk hutch actually need to be bolted to a wall for safety?", "a": "Most picks in this comparison include anti-tip straps meant to anchor to a wall or desk, and using them is worth doing if the hutch will hold weight on its top shelves, though a lighter, well-balanced load on lower shelves reduces the practical risk somewhat." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when picking a desk hutch for a monitor setup?", "a": "Not checking the exact open-back clearance dimensions against their monitor's actual width and stand height, since a hutch marketed as fitting 'most monitors' can still block a wide curved or ultrawide screen that wasn't specifically tested." },
  { "q": "Is the Furinno Classic pick worth it over the cheaper Nova Microdermabrasion option?", "a": "If you need the highest weight capacity, anti-toppling hardware, or a specific monitor clearance, yes, but if you just want basic multi-tier open storage without a monitor cutout, the Nova Microdermabrasion pick covers that for about $15 less." },
  { "q": "How do I set up the Marbrasse pick's fabric drawer without it sagging over time?", "a": "Keep heavier items on the open wood shelves and reserve the fabric drawer for lighter personal items like chargers or notebooks, since fabric drawers are generally rated for less weight than the surrounding wood shelving." },
  { "q": "Can these desk hutches sit on top of a standing desk safely?", "a": "Yes, as long as the standing desk's surface can support the hutch's own weight plus its stated capacity, though checking your desk's stated weight limit against the hutch's total loaded weight is worth doing before mounting one on a height-adjustable desk." },
  { "q": "Do any of these picks include built-in cable management?", "a": "None of the four picks in this comparison specifically include cable management features like grommet holes or cable channels, so if that's a priority, plan to route cables externally or add a separate cable tray." }
