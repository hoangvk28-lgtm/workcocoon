export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Docks With Built-in 10GbE Consistently Cost More Because the Underlying Network Chip and Cooling Requirements Are Genuinely More Complex",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison cluster at $449.99 or higher, reflecting the real engineering cost of integrating genuine 10 Gigabit Ethernet alongside Thunderbolt 5 data and display bandwidth in a single dock, since 10GbE controllers generate meaningfully more heat and require more sophisticated power delivery than standard Gigabit Ethernet. This matters if you're comparing this tier against cheaper docks with only 2.5GbE or standard Gigabit Ethernet, where the price jump reflects genuine hardware complexity rather than pure brand markup. Expect to pay a premium for genuine 10GbE integration compared to more common 1GbE or 2.5GbE dock options, since this reflects real component and engineering cost differences, not just marketing positioning."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual 10GbE Ports Serve a Genuinely Different Use Case Than a Single 10GbE Port Plus Storage Expansion",
    "explanation": "The OWC pick's two independent 10GbE ports let you maintain simultaneous connections to two separate high-speed networks (for example, a production network and a backup network), a capability the single-10GbE-port Sonnet picks can't replicate regardless of their other strengths like built-in NVMe storage. This matters if your specific workflow genuinely requires dual independent high-speed network connections, and matters less if a single 10GbE connection to one network, paired with local NVMe storage instead, better serves your actual needs. Determine whether your workflow needs two independent 10GbE network connections or would benefit more from a single 10GbE port paired with built-in local storage before choosing between the OWC and Sonnet approaches."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Advanced Thermal Design Becomes Genuinely Necessary to Sustain Peak Bandwidth During Extended High-Load Use",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY pick's triple-layer thermal system, combining an NTC-controlled fan, internal copper heat sinks, and a floating chassis chimney-effect design, is specifically engineered to sustain its 120Gbps peak performance during 24/7 operation, a meaningfully more elaborate cooling approach than a simpler dock might use. This matters if you run the dock under sustained heavy load for extended periods, such as continuous RAID array access or all-day video editing sessions, where inadequate cooling could cause thermal throttling that reduces real-world performance, and matters less for lighter, intermittent use. Check a dock's specific stated thermal design approach if your typical workload involves sustained, maximum-bandwidth operation for extended periods rather than brief, occasional use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mac-Exclusive Dual-Silicon Architecture Delivers Maximum Throughput But Locks You Into a Single Platform",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY pick's dual 80/120Gbps silicon architecture is specifically engineered exclusively for the Mac ecosystem, unlocking display and bandwidth capabilities the listing describes as previously impossible on standard Mac docks, but this Mac-exclusive design means it offers no meaningful functionality if you ever need to use it with a Windows or Linux system. This matters if you're committed entirely to the Mac ecosystem and want the absolute maximum performance that platform-specific engineering can deliver, and matters significantly if there's any chance you'll need cross-platform compatibility in the future, where the OWC and Sonnet picks' broader compatibility would serve you better long-term. Consider your long-term platform commitment before choosing a Mac-exclusive dock over a cross-platform alternative with slightly different performance characteristics."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standard Cat6 or Cat6A Cable Compatibility Determines Whether You Need Specialized Networking Infrastructure",
    "explanation": "The Sonnet Echo 20 SecureDock specifically confirms its 10GbE port works with standard Cat6 or Cat6A cabling rather than requiring specialized fiber or Cat6A-only infrastructure, meaning most existing home or office network cabling can support the connection without upgrades. This matters if you're integrating the dock into an existing network setup with standard cabling already in place, where confirmed Cat6/Cat6A compatibility avoids an unexpected infrastructure upgrade cost, and matters less if you're building a new network from scratch anyway. Check a dock's specific stated cable compatibility for its 10GbE port before assuming your existing network cabling will support the full 10Gbps speed."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need special networking equipment to use these docks' 10GbE ports?", "a": "The Sonnet Echo 20 specifically confirms compatibility with standard Cat6 or Cat6A cabling, so most existing network setups with reasonably modern cabling should support the full 10Gbps speed without needing specialized fiber infrastructure." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a USB4 dock with 10GbE?", "a": "Assuming any dock with an Ethernet port delivers 10Gbps speeds, when many docks in this general category actually include only standard Gigabit or 2.5Gbps Ethernet, with genuine 10GbE consistently appearing only at this comparison's premium price tier." },
  { "q": "Is the iVANKY FusionDock Ultra worth its significant price premium if I use both Mac and Windows devices?", "a": "No, since the iVANKY pick is specifically engineered exclusively for the Mac ecosystem, buyers who need cross-platform compatibility should choose the OWC or either Sonnet pick instead, which all support Mac, Windows, Chromebook, and iPad Pro." },
  { "q": "How do I decide between the OWC's dual 10GbE ports and the Sonnet Echo 21's built-in NVMe storage?", "a": "If your workflow genuinely requires two independent high-speed network connections simultaneously, the OWC's dual ports serve that specific need, but if local fast storage matters more than a second network connection, the Sonnet Echo 21's built-in NVMe slot is the better fit." },
  { "q": "Will these docks work with older Thunderbolt 3 laptops, or do they require Thunderbolt 5?", "a": "The OWC pick specifically states Thunderbolt 3 support is available but Mac-only and requires a specific macOS version, so checking each pick's exact minimum host generation and OS version requirements for your specific device is worth doing before purchase." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Sonnet Echo 21's built-in NVMe slot without buying a separate SSD?", "a": "No, the M.2 NVMe SSD slot requires you to purchase and install a compatible SSD separately, as the dock itself only provides the enclosure and connection infrastructure, not the storage drive itself." }
