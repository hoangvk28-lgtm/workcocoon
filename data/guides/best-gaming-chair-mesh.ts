export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Are mesh gaming chairs actually cooler than PU leather or fabric chairs?", a: "Yes. Mesh is a woven, open material that allows air to pass through the seat and backrest, which prevents the heat buildup that solid PU leather or padded fabric surfaces trap against the body during long sessions. Full-mesh chairs like the BestOffice and TRALT maximize this effect across the whole seating surface." },
  { q: "Is a mesh-and-foam hybrid seat, like the SIHOO M18, less breathable than full mesh?", a: "The seat cushion itself is less breathable since it uses memory foam instead of mesh, but the backrest, which covers more surface area against a seated body, remains mesh. This hybrid approach trades some seat breathability for extra cushioning, which some buyers prefer over a firmer full-mesh seat." },
  { q: "What does BIFMA certification mean on a mesh gaming chair?", a: "BIFMA is an independent furniture industry testing standard covering structural durability, stability, and safety. A BIFMA-certified frame, like the BestOffice, NEO CHAIR, SIHOO M18, TRALT, and GABRYLLY in this guide, has been tested against these standards rather than relying solely on the manufacturer's stated weight capacity." },
  { q: "How much weight capacity do I actually need in a mesh gaming chair?", a: "The chairs in this guide range from 250 lbs (BestOffice) to 400 lbs (CAPOT). Choose a capacity comfortably above your body weight, not just equal to it, since sustained daily use and shifting body position add stress beyond a static seated load. Heavier or taller users should lean toward the CAPOT or GABRYLLY." },
