  "Gaming-marketed vertical mice are a genuinely small niche, and the label 'gaming' doesn't guarantee the sensor and DPI quality of a dedicated gaming mouse at a similar price. This category tends to see less R&D investment than mainstream gaming mice, so it's worth checking actual DPI figures and buyer feedback on tracking accuracy rather than assuming parity just because a product uses gaming branding or RGB lighting.",
  "We also looked at how comfortable each pick is for fast lateral movement common in FPS-style games specifically, since the vertical grip changes wrist mechanics in ways that can help or hurt depending on genre, and checked programmable button count and placement against typical needs for MMO or MOBA titles versus FPS titles. Adjustable weight is rare in this niche, more often fixed, so we noted that explicitly rather than assuming it's available.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match the vertical angle to your actual hand size and grip",
    "explanation": "A vertical mouse's tilt angle, usually somewhere between 45 and 90 degrees from flat, is what actually reduces forearm rotation strain, but the ideal angle isn't the same for every hand, a mouse shaped for a larger hand can feel awkwardly steep and unstable in a smaller hand, and vice versa.\n\nThis matters because the entire ergonomic benefit depends on the mouse fitting your hand well enough to hold a natural, relaxed grip, a mismatched size can actually introduce new strain from over-gripping to keep the mouse stable.\n\nCheck the listing for hand-size guidance (often given in inches from wrist to middle fingertip) rather than assuming a single design fits all hand sizes equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider DPI range and sensor quality for your actual desk surface and use",
    "explanation": "DPI (dots per inch) determines cursor sensitivity, and while a wide adjustable DPI range sounds like a universal benefit, what actually matters is whether the sensor tracks accurately and consistently at the DPI level you'll realistically use, a mouse with an impressively high max DPI but a mediocre sensor can still feel imprecise in daily use.\n\nThis matters more for precision work like design or spreadsheet navigation than for basic web browsing, where sensor quality differences are less noticeable.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of tracking accuracy and cursor jitter, not just the advertised maximum DPI number, since the two don't always correlate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless connectivity type against your actual setup and battery expectations",
    "explanation": "A vertical mouse connects via Bluetooth, a proprietary RF USB dongle, or a wired cable, and each comes with real tradeoffs, Bluetooth avoids using a USB port but can have a small input lag some users notice, an RF dongle is generally more responsive but takes up a port and is easy to lose while traveling, and wired eliminates battery concerns entirely but limits desk placement flexibility.\n\nThis matters directly if you're already short on USB ports, travel frequently with the mouse, or care about minimal input latency for precise work.\n\nCheck the specific connectivity type and, for wireless options, the claimed battery life under real use, not just standby time, before assuming any wireless mouse fits your setup equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check button placement and count against how you actually use a mouse day to day",
    "explanation": "Extra programmable buttons for back/forward navigation or DPI switching are only genuinely useful if they're placed where your thumb naturally rests during normal use, a button that requires shifting your grip to reach defeats its own ergonomic purpose.\n\nThis matters more for anyone doing heavy web browsing or navigation-heavy work where back/forward buttons get used constantly, less for someone doing simple pointing and clicking.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of thumb button reachability and accidental misclicks, not just the total button count listed in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Factor in adjustment period and whether the design suits your actual daily tasks",
    "explanation": "Switching to a vertical mouse from a standard mouse involves a genuine adjustment period, typically one to two weeks, during which precision and speed can feel worse before the new grip becomes natural, this is a normal part of the transition, not a sign the mouse is a bad fit.\n\nThis matters most for anyone doing precision-dependent work like graphic design or gaming, where a temporary drop in accuracy during the adjustment period has a real short-term cost worth planning around.\n\nCheck reviews for mentions of how long the adjustment period took for reviewers with a similar use case to yours, and consider trying the new grip during a lower-stakes work period rather than a deadline crunch."
