    q: "Do I need a Teams-certified headset for Microsoft Teams?",
    a: "No. Any headset works on Teams as a standard audio device. Teams Certified headsets add native button integration (mute, call answer, and end sync with the platform) and are tested to Teams audio quality standards. For light Teams use (a few calls per day), any pick in this guide works. For call-center or sales roles on Teams for 6+ hours daily, certification saves real friction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a boom mic better than a built-in mic for work calls?",
    a: "Generally yes, especially in noisy environments. A boom mic positions the microphone 3 to 5cm from your mouth, physically increasing your voice signal-to-noise ratio. Built-in mics rely on software DSP or AI to achieve the same result. At equivalent price, a boom mic outperforms a basic built-in array. An AI-enhanced built-in array like the Anker H700 or Sony XM5 is competitive with boom mics in most real-world conditions.",

    q: "What is the best wireless headset for working from home?",
    a: "Depends on call volume and budget. For light to moderate calls: Logitech Zone Vibe 125 at $70-$90. For Teams-heavy roles: Jabra Evolve2 55 MS at $169, the certification and 33-hour battery justify the cost. For open-plan office or loud WFH environments: Sony WH-1000XM5 at $248 for best-in-class ANC.",

    q: "Can I use noise-cancelling headphones like Sony or Bose for work calls?",
    a: "Yes. Both the Sony WH-1000XM5 and Bose QC45 deliver good call quality on Zoom and Teams as standard Bluetooth devices. The tradeoff: hardware button integration does not sync with platform mute state, and there is no boom mic. For most WFH users this is acceptable. For enterprise environments requiring certified devices, use the Jabra Evolve2 series.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a wired headset sound better than wireless for calls?",
    a: "At equivalent price, yes. Wired delivers lossless audio with zero compression. At $25-$65, the Logitech H390 and Jabra Evolve2 30 MS outperform wireless headsets at similar prices for microphone clarity. Above $90, wireless DSP and AI processing close the gap significantly.",
