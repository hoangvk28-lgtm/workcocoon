      "at a budget-friendly price, the LBP6030w is one of the cheapest true laser printers available, and it sticks to print-only duty rather than trying to be an all-in-one on a limited budget. Rated at 19 PPM, it's built for straightforward monochrome documents rather than photos or graphics-heavy pages. A compact wireless single-function design keeps the footprint small on a shared desk, and the 1-year limited warranty is standard for the price tier. Buyers should plan for a toner replacement cartridge purchase sooner than the box implies, since the included starter toner is a lower-yield cartridge. A genuine advantage here is that fast, crisp monochrome text output. The tradeoff is print only, no scan or copy.",

    "explanation": "Listings for a budget laser printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the budget laser printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this budget laser printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any budget laser printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A budget laser printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Is a budget laser printer actually cheaper than an inkjet long-term?",
    a: "For text-heavy printing, generally yes. Laser toner produces a lower cost per page than inkjet cartridges once you're past the initial purchase price, and toner doesn't dry out during periods of infrequent use the way inkjet cartridges can. Factor in the true replacement toner cost, not just the starter cartridge included in the box, before comparing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my new laser printer's toner run out faster than the box advertised?",
    a: "Budget laser printers commonly ship with a starter toner cartridge rated for roughly half the page yield of the standard replacement cartridge. The advertised cost-per-page figure on the box is usually based on the full-yield replacement cartridge, not the starter one, so your first toner purchase often comes sooner than expected.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long should I expect a budget laser printer to last?",
    a: "Around 2 to 3 years of comfortable service under moderate home use is a realistic expectation for entry-tier laser hardware, which typically uses plastic gears and lighter-duty pickup rollers than mid-tier models. That's not a flaw specific to any one brand, it's the trade-off for the lower purchase price across this category.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose monochrome or color laser on a budget?",
    a: "Choose monochrome, like the Canon LBP6030w or Brother HL-L2405W, if you mostly print text documents, it's cheaper to buy and cheaper per page. Only go with a color laser like the Brother HL-L3220CDW if you regularly need color output, since replacing all four toner cartridges in a color laser system costs more than a single monochrome swap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need duplex printing on a budget laser printer?",
    a: "Only if you print double-sided documents regularly, the HP LaserJet M209d, Brother DCP-L2640DW, and Brother HL-L3220CDW all include automatic duplex, while the two cheapest picks in this list don't. Manual double-sided printing is possible on non-duplex models but requires flipping and reloading pages yourself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I add scan and copy later if I buy a print-only laser printer?",
    a: "No, print-only laser printers like the Canon LBP6030w and Brother HL-L2405W don't support adding scan or copy hardware after purchase. If there's a reasonable chance you'll need scan or copy down the line, it's worth choosing an all-in-one model like the Brother DCP-L2640DW upfront.",
