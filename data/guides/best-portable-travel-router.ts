export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Router's Stated Weight in Grams Is a More Reliable Comparison Point Than 'Pocket-Sized' Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "Multiple travel routers describe themselves as pocket-sized or compact in marketing copy, but only a specific stated weight (like 39 grams) and dimension measurement give you an objective way to compare actual physical size between listings, since 'pocket-sized' can mean very different things depending on the specific pocket or bag compartment you have in mind. This matters significantly if minimizing carry weight is a genuine priority, like for backpacking or strict carry-on luggage limits, and matters less if you have ample room in checked luggage or a larger travel bag. Check for a specific stated weight and dimension figure rather than relying on marketing terms like 'pocket-sized' or 'compact' alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Smallest Routers Often Trade Away Dual-Band Wi-Fi for 2.4GHz-Only Operation",
    "explanation": "Both of the lightest routers in this comparison operate on 2.4GHz only, while the slightly larger TP-Link WiFi 5 pick offers dual-band AC750 speed, meaning the smallest physical size sometimes comes with a real bandwidth tradeoff since 2.4GHz networks are more prone to congestion and interference in busy areas like hotels or airports. This matters more if you're often in Wi-Fi-congested environments where 5GHz's cleaner spectrum offers a real speed advantage, and matters less for basic browsing and email where 2.4GHz's range advantage can actually help. Check whether a compact router specifically supports 5GHz if congestion resistance and speed matter more to you than achieving the absolute minimum size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Operation Mode Flexibility Determines How Many Different Travel Scenarios a Single Router Can Actually Handle",
    "explanation": "A router supporting 5 distinct operation modes, like router, AP, client, repeater, and WISP, can adapt to a wider range of situations, from connecting to a hotel's wired Ethernet, to extending an existing weak Wi-Fi signal, to connecting through a WISP-style outdoor antenna setup, while a simpler router might only support a router or hotspot mode. This matters more if you travel to varied locations with different connectivity setups (hotels, campgrounds, coworking spaces), and matters less if your travel pattern is consistent and always involves the same type of connection. Check the specific number and type of supported operation modes if your travel involves genuinely varied connectivity scenarios."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VPN Software Included on the Smallest Routers Isn't Guaranteed, Even Among Otherwise Similar Ultra-Light Models",
    "explanation": "Two routers can share nearly identical size and weight specifications while differing significantly in VPN capability, as seen between the two 39-gram picks in this comparison, one offering client and server support with WireGuard while the other offers OpenVPN client only. This matters if VPN protection is a requirement alongside minimal size, and matters less if you plan to run VPN software on your individual devices rather than at the router level. Check a compact router's specific VPN feature list rather than assuming similar-sized units offer identical security capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Router Designed Specifically for Ethernet-to-WiFi Conversion Solves a Different Problem Than a General-Purpose Pocket Router",
    "explanation": "Some travel routers are specifically designed around converting a wired Ethernet-only connection into Wi-Fi, useful for older hotels or rentals that never upgraded to in-room Wi-Fi, while a general-purpose pocket router handles wired, wireless, and cellular tethering scenarios more broadly. This matters if you frequently encounter Ethernet-only accommodations, where a purpose-built converter router avoids any Wi-Fi hotspot mode compatibility questions with public networks, and matters less if you mostly deal with existing Wi-Fi networks needing conversion to a private one. Check whether a router's stated design purpose specifically matches your most common connectivity scenario while traveling."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How small is a genuinely pocket-sized travel router?", "a": "The lightest models in this comparison weigh just 39 grams (about 1.4 ounces), significantly lighter than a standard travel router, small enough to fit easily in a jacket pocket or small bag compartment." },
  { "q": "Do the smallest travel routers sacrifice features for their size?", "a": "Not always; some ultra-light 39-gram routers in this comparison still include OpenWrt customization and VPN client and server support, though others trade away 5GHz Wi-Fi or VPN software for the smallest possible size." },
  { "q": "Can a pocket travel router work in a hotel room with only an Ethernet jack?", "a": "Yes, but check that the specific model supports converting a wired connection to Wi-Fi; some travel routers are specifically designed for this Ethernet-to-WiFi conversion scenario." },
  { "q": "Is 2.4GHz-only Wi-Fi a problem for a travel router?", "a": "It can be more prone to congestion in busy areas like hotels or airports compared to 5GHz, though it also offers better range, so the tradeoff depends on your specific environment and priorities." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between router mode and repeater mode on a pocket travel router?", "a": "Router mode typically connects to a wired or tethered internet source and creates a new network, while repeater mode extends an existing Wi-Fi signal that's already present but weak in your current location." },
  { "q": "Do I need OpenWrt on a pocket travel router?", "a": "Only if you want deep customization or plan to install additional network software; several pocket-sized routers in this comparison skip OpenWrt entirely in favor of a simpler, more accessible setup process." }
