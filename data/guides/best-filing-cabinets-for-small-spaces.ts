Three lockable drawers cover letters, legal, and A4 sizes, and the narrow body keeps the footprint close to a typical desk pedestal.\n\nThe main tradeoff in tight rooms is drawer swing. A fully extended top drawer needs close to three feet of clearance in front of the cabinet, so placement against a wall opposite a walking path works better than wedging it into a corner. It rolls on casters, so nudging it out for access is easy even in a cramped office.\n\nFully assembled out of the box. Set against that, needs nearly 3 ft of front clearance when open.

If your desk sits on a standing-desk frame, measure your sitting-height clearance before ordering since 2-drawer pedestal height can run close to the low end of that range.\n\nA genuine advantage here is that fully assembled.

The lateral layout means the width is the main space commitment rather than the depth.\n\nWith three drawers loaded, a filled cabinet like this can reach 80 to 100 lbs, so plan its final position before loading it since repositioning a fully loaded lateral cabinet on carpet is a two-person job even with casters.\n\nWorth calling out specifically: mobile casters included.

  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best filing cabinet often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best filing cabinet holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best filing cabinet over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best filing cabinet you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best filing cabinet that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How much clearance does a filing cabinet actually need in a small room?", a: "Don't just measure the closed cabinet. A 2-drawer vertical cabinet needs roughly 38 to 40 inches of clear floor in front of it for the top drawer to fully extend. Lateral cabinets, which open sideways, need less depth but more width along the wall. Measure both the box and the swing space before committing to a spot." },
  { q: "Will a filing cabinet fit under my standing desk?", a: "It depends on your desk's clearance at its lowest sitting height, typically 23 to 28 inches, and the cabinet's stated height, commonly 24 to 28 inches for rolling pedestals. Measure your desk's minimum sitting clearance first, then compare it against the cabinet's exact listed height rather than assuming any 'under desk' cabinet will fit." },
  { q: "Are rolling filing cabinets stable, or do they tip over?", a: "Stability depends on the caster setup. Cabinets with a single small caster set can tip forward when rolled onto a rug edge or floor transition. Locking front casters or a 5-caster arrangement reduce that risk. Once positioned, lock the wheels if the cabinet has that option." },
  { q: "Do all small filing cabinets support standard hanging file folders?", a: "No. Some compact cabinets only accept front-to-back hanging files rather than the side-to-side rail most standard hanging folders use. Check the listing's hanging rail specification before assuming a cabinet marked 'letter/legal' works with your existing folders." },
  { q: "What's the difference between vertical and lateral cabinets for small spaces?", a: "Vertical cabinets open forward and need more floor depth in front of them but take up less wall width. Lateral cabinets open sideways, trading depth requirements for wall width. Choose based on which dimension is actually scarce in your room." },
