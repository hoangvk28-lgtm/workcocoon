export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "ADAT Optical Expansion Is a Genuine Future-Proofing Feature, Not a Spec You'll Necessarily Use Immediately",
    "explanation": "The Audient iD14 MKII's ADAT optical input specifically allows connecting a compatible external preamp expander to add 8 more input channels beyond its built-in 2, meaning you could grow from a 2-channel setup to a 10-channel setup without replacing the original interface, something a fixed-channel-count design like the MOTU M4 or Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 simply cannot do no matter how good their built-in preamps are. This matters if you anticipate your recording needs growing over time, such as moving from solo content to full-band recording, and matters much less if you're confident your channel needs will stay at or below 4 inputs indefinitely. Check whether ADAT expansion is explicitly listed before assuming a fixed-channel interface can be upgraded later, since retrofitting expansion into a non-ADAT interface isn't possible."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Specifically Stated Dynamic Range Figure in Decibels Tells You More About Real Converter Quality Than Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "The MOTU M4 specifically states 120dB of dynamic range from its ESS Sabre32 Ultra converters, a concrete technical specification that lets you directly compare its actual conversion quality against other interfaces that disclose similar figures, rather than relying on vague claims like 'studio quality' or 'pristine audio' that carry no verifiable number behind them. This matters more the more critical your listening and mixing decisions are, particularly for music production where subtle dynamic range differences affect how quiet passages and loud peaks translate into the final recording. Look specifically for a stated dynamic range figure in decibels and the specific converter chipset name in a listing, rather than accepting generic audio quality marketing claims at face value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In Loopback for Streaming Solves a Real Technical Problem That Otherwise Requires Separate Software",
    "explanation": "The MOTU M4 and Focusrite Scarlett 4i4's built-in Loopback feature lets you mix live microphone input with computer playback audio (like a guest on a video call, background music, or sound effects) into a single combined output stream directly in hardware, a task that would otherwise require installing and configuring separate virtual audio routing software like a third-party loopback utility. This matters directly if your workflow involves live streaming, recording video calls with combined audio, or podcast interviews with remote guests, and matters much less if you only record from a live microphone with no computer audio mixed in. Check whether a listing specifically states built-in loopback capability if combined-audio streaming is part of your intended use case, since not every interface at this price point includes it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Vintage Tone-Shaping at This Tier Now Comes With More Total Inputs, Changing the Underlying Tradeoff",
    "explanation": "The Universal Audio Volt 276 extends the same Vintage Mic Preamp mode and 76 Compressor emulation found in the cheaper Volt 2 across a full 4-input configuration (2 mic plus 2 line), meaning you no longer have to choose between vintage character and higher channel count the way you might at a lower price tier, unlike the Volt 2 which offered vintage tone but only 2 total inputs. This matters if you specifically want tube-style coloration for a band or duo recording session with more than 2 sound sources, a combination the cheaper Volt 2 alone can't provide. Consider whether your specific recording style benefits from vintage coloration across multiple simultaneous channels, not just a single voice or instrument, before assuming a clean interface is always the safer default at higher channel counts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Independent Headphone Outputs Determine Whether Multiple People Can Monitor Different Mixes Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The MOTU M4 specifically includes 2 independent headphone outputs with separate volume controls, letting two people each hear their own custom monitor mix at the same time, a genuinely useful feature during a duo recording session where one performer wants more of their own vocal in their headphones while the other wants more of the backing track. This matters directly if you regularly record with another person who needs their own independent monitor mix, and matters less if you're the only person who ever wears headphones during a session. Check the specifically stated number of independent headphone outputs (not just headphone jacks that share one identical signal) before assuming any interface with multiple headphone ports supports genuinely separate monitor mixes for each person."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the Audient iD14 MKII's ADAT expansion work with any brand of preamp expander, or only Audient's own?", "a": "ADAT is an industry-standard optical protocol, so the iD14 MKII can generally work with ADAT-equipped preamp expanders from other brands, though checking specific sample-rate compatibility between the two devices is worth doing since some ADAT connections have channel-count limitations at higher sample rates." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing fixed-channel and ADAT-expandable interfaces at this price?", "a": "Assuming a higher immediate built-in channel count (like the MOTU M4's 4 preamps) is always better than an expandable design with fewer built-in channels (like the Audient iD14 MKII's 2), when your actual long-term growth plans should determine which tradeoff makes more sense for your specific situation." },
  { "q": "Is the Universal Audio Volt 276 worth it over the Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 if I mainly record podcasts?", "a": "If you want warm vintage coloration on voices, the Volt 276 delivers that, but most podcast production benefits from a clean, transparent signal path you can shape in post-production, making the Scarlett 4i4's Auto Gain and clean preamps generally the better fit for spoken-word content." },
  { "q": "How do I set up the MOTU M4's built-in Loopback feature for a livestream?", "a": "Loopback channels appear as selectable inputs within your streaming or recording software's audio settings, and once selected, computer playback audio automatically mixes with your live microphone input without needing any separate virtual audio routing software installed." },
  { "q": "Do any of these interfaces support recording at higher sample rates like 192kHz, or are they limited to 96kHz?", "a": "Support varies by model, so checking each interface's specifically stated maximum sample rate in the listing is worth doing if very high-resolution recording matters for your specific production workflow, rather than assuming all four picks in this tier support identical maximum rates." },
  { "q": "Can I use 2 headphone outputs on the MOTU M4 to give both performers completely independent mixes, not just independent volume?", "a": "The 2 headphone outputs have independent volume controls, and depending on the software mixer configuration, each can also often be routed to a genuinely different custom mix, though checking the specific mixer software's routing capabilities is worth doing to confirm fully independent mix control rather than just independent volume levels." }
