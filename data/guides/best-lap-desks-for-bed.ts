  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best lap desk often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best lap desk holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best lap desk over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best lap desk you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best lap desk that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is it safe to use a laptop in bed with a lap desk?", a: "Using a hard-surface lap desk in bed is safer than placing the laptop directly on bedding. Soft bedding blocks laptop bottom vents and causes overheating. A lap desk elevates the laptop off the bed surface with a hard base that keeps vents completely clear, which protects both the laptop hardware and your legs from heat." },
  { q: "What size lap desk do I need for a 15-inch laptop?", a: "A lap desk with at least a 17-inch wide surface comfortably holds a 15-inch laptop with clearance on both sides. For a 17-inch gaming laptop, choose at least a 19-inch wide surface. Add extra width if you also want to use an external mouse on the same surface." },
  { q: "Do adjustable lap desks work while lying down?", a: "Height-plus-angle adjustable models (SAIJI XL, SAIJI medium) work in multiple reclining positions including semi-reclined and near-horizontal. Fixed-height cushion boards work best for upright sitting. If you use your laptop in bed from multiple positions, an adjustable model is worth the premium." },
  { q: "How do I store a lap desk in a small bedroom?", a: "Foldable leg lap desks (SAIJI Foldable) collapse flat and store under a mattress or standing in a closet. Non-folding models like cushion boards are thinner and can often stand on end in a corner. The SAIJI XL with legs is the most space-consuming when not folded." },
  { q: "Can I use a lap desk on a sofa?", a: "Yes. Lap desks designed for bed use work equally well on sofas and armchairs. The cushioned base adapts to sofa cushion surfaces in the same way it adapts to mattress surfaces. Height-adjustable models work on sofas by adjusting to the lower typical sofa seat height." }
