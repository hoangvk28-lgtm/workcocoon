  },
  {
    "q": "Should I prioritize price or pen quality when choosing drawing tablets without screens?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."

    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
