      "This three-tier metal cart rolls on four casters and can be positioned next to a desk, inside a closet, or in any room in the office without requiring tools or assembly beyond basic frame snap-together. Each of the three open shelves holds up to 22 pounds, which is sufficient for an inkjet printer on the top tier alongside paper reams, reference binders, and supplies on the lower tiers. The open shelf design means you can see and grab items immediately without opening drawers or lifting lids, which suits frequently used office consumables.\n\nTwo of the four casters lock in place to prevent the cart from rolling when you set items down or pull things off a shelf. The all-white alloy steel finish fits broadly into light-colored home office spaces, though the finish can show marks in high-contact areas over time.",

      "The Pipishell cart has the same three open-shelf layout and 22-pound-per-shelf capacity as the Simple Houseware, but adds an integrated handle at the top of the frame that lets you lift and carry the cart rather than just rolling it. That handle is practical in home offices where door thresholds, area rugs, or furniture legs would catch a rolling cart and require it to be lifted anyway. It is priced below the Simple Houseware alternative, making it the less expensive choice between the two metal utility carts in this roundup with comparable shelf capacity. Two lockable casters prevent the cart from drifting when loaded.

      "The HOMZ 4-Drawer cart uses a stacked drawer design where each of the four compartments slides out independently, so contents are enclosed and out of sight when the drawers are closed, unlike open-shelf utility carts where everything is visible at all times. The four separate drawers make it practical to divide supplies by type, for example one drawer for paper and one for tech accessories, without mixing categories in a single compartment.\n\nFour 360-degree casters allow the cart to pivot in any direction, which helps when navigating tight spaces between desk chairs and furniture in small home offices. The body is made from 90% recycled plastic materials. Plastic construction is lighter than metal but generally less resistant to heavy loads or rough handling, and the drawers are slower to access than open shelves when you need to grab something quickly.",

That visibility benefit is useful when multiple people share the cart or when you need to find something quickly without sorting through every drawer.\n\nThe wheels on this model are removable, which means the cart can be converted into a freestanding stationary storage unit if you decide to place it in a fixed location inside a cabinet or closet.

The cart combines a removable enclosed drawer with two open shelves, so you can keep items you want out of sight in the drawer while using the shelves for things you reach for frequently.

A key lock on the drawers prevents unauthorized access to sensitive documents, which matters in shared home office spaces or for anyone storing financial or legal paperwork. The cabinet rides on five casters rather than the standard four, which spreads the load more evenly and reduces the chance of tipping when a heavy drawer is fully extended.
