  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "Do I actually need a 4-bay NAS, or would 2 bays be enough?",
    a: "If your real need is simple mirrored backup or a smaller content library, a 2-bay NAS like the Synology DS223 or UGREEN DH2300 costs meaningfully less than any true 4-bay setup, enclosure and drives included. Reserve a 4-bay purchase for when you specifically need RAID 5 or RAID 10 flexibility, or capacity beyond what 2 drives can reasonably provide.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the real total cost of a 4-bay NAS, not just the enclosure price?",
    a: "A diskless 4-bay enclosure around $600-700 plus 4 NAS-grade 8TB drives at roughly $180 each brings the total to $1,320 or more. Always factor in drive cost separately, since diskless enclosure pricing alone significantly understates the full investment.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between the QNAP TR-004/TERRAMASTER D4-320 and the network NAS picks in this list?",
    a: "The QNAP TR-004 and TERRAMASTER D4-320 are direct-attached storage enclosures connected via USB to a single computer, not network-attached storage. A true NAS like the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus or Synology models connects over Ethernet and can be accessed by multiple devices on the network, even remotely, while a direct-attached enclosure requires its host computer to stay powered on.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose RAID 5, hybrid RAID, or RAID 10 for a 4-bay NAS?",
    a: "RAID 5 gives about 75% usable capacity with 1-drive failure protection and is the most common general-use recommendation. Hybrid RAID (SHR) lets you mix drive sizes and expand gradually, useful if you plan to upgrade drives one at a time. RAID 10 gives only 50% usable capacity but the fastest read/write speeds, best for Plex or other heavy read workloads.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do newer Synology models show compatibility warnings for third-party drives?",
    a: "Synology's 2024-and-newer Plus-series models, including the DS925+, flag non-Synology-branded drives with compatibility warnings in DSM. The NAS still functions with third-party NAS-grade drives, but Synology-branded drives avoid the warning at a 15-30% price premium. Factor this into your total cost if drive brand flexibility matters to you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How risky is a RAID rebuild after a drive failure in a 4-bay NAS?",
    a: "A 4-bay RAID 5 array with 8TB drives typically takes 12 to 48 hours to rebuild after a single drive failure. During that window, NAS performance degrades and a second drive failure would cause total data loss, which is why some buyers prefer RAID 10 or hybrid RAID for a less risky rebuild profile.",
