    "explanation": "Listings for a rolling chair mat often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the rolling chair mat holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this rolling chair mat over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any rolling chair mat you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A rolling chair mat that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

  {
    q: "Why does my chair roll poorly even with a rolling chair mat?",
    a: "The mismatch is often between your caster wheel type and the mat's surface texture. Hard plastic casters need some surface grip to roll smoothly, while soft polyurethane casters already grip well and roll best on a fully smooth surface like tempered glass. If the mat is rated for your floor type and it still rolls poorly, worn or undersized casters may be the actual problem, not the mat.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a smooth or textured chair mat?",
    a: "Smooth surfaces, like polished PVC or tempered glass, roll best on hard floors but offer almost no grip on carpet. Textured or cleated surfaces are necessary on carpet to anchor the mat and give the chair something to push against, but they roll less smoothly than a fully smooth mat. Match the surface to your floor type rather than choosing based on looks alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are rolling chair mats noisy on hardwood floors?",
    a: "Hard, smooth surfaces like tempered glass or rigid polycarbonate can produce a light tapping sound as the chair rolls across them, more noticeable at night in a quiet home. Textured PVC mats like the SHAREWIN tend to run quieter. If noise matters in your space, factor that in alongside rolling smoothness.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size rolling chair mat do I need for a standing desk?",
    a: "A standing desk moves through a full range of heights, shifting where your chair sits relative to the desk. A larger mat, 45 inches or more on the long side like the Koonmi Tempered Glass at 46\"x55\" or the MuArts at 54\"x32\", keeps the chair rolling smoothly across that whole range instead of running off the mat's edge at certain heights.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a carpet-rated rolling chair mat on a hard floor?",
    a: "Some dual-use mats, like the MuArts Crystal Clear or the MESAILUP Polycarbonate, are rigid enough to work on both carpet and hard floors without needing spikes or cleats. But a mat built specifically with underside spikes or cleats for carpet, like the GORILLA GRIP, isn't meant for hard floors, since those spikes have nothing to grip and can scratch the surface.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a thicker or heavier chair mat always better?",
    a: "Not necessarily. A thicker mat like the 5mm MuArts or the 0.2\" tempered glass picks generally offers higher weight capacity and more rigidity, which helps on carpet. But on a hard floor, a thinner mat with a smooth or lightly textured surface can actually roll better and is easier to reposition, so match thickness to your actual floor and capacity needs rather than assuming thicker is always the better choice.",
