    q: "Are Sauder executive desks real wood?",
    a: "No. Sauder executive desks are engineered wood (particle board or MDF) with a laminate or melamine surface finish. They look like wood but are not solid hardwood.

Bush Business Furniture uses higher-density substrate, commercial laminate, better drawer hardware, and a 10-year warranty - designed for commercial environments where desks are used 40+ hours per week.

Warranties, construction standards, and hardware quality differ between the two lines.",

    q: "Can you get a genuine solid wood executive desk on Amazon?",
    a: "Yes, but options are limited at reasonable prices. The QZYJKJ and quanzhoulong picks on this list are solid wood. Most solid hardwood executive desks at $1,500+ from brands like Hooker Furniture are not typically sold on Amazon. The $600-$900 price range on Amazon is mostly commercial-grade engineered wood, not solid hardwood.",

    a: "Dark rich finishes (dark walnut, espresso, coffee) read as premium furniture on standard webcam quality. Light finishes (pebble pine, beige, bright white) read as flat-pack regardless of actual quality. The Bush Business Office 500 in Black Walnut and the dark Sauder Palladia finishes photograph significantly better than light alternatives.",
