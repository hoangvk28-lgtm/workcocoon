Tapered wood legs and clean mid-century lines make it a piece that reads as living room furniture rather than a media rack, so it holds up visually next to a sofa and coffee table.\n\nThe two side cabinets hide cable boxes, gaming consoles, and cords behind solid doors, while the open glass shelf in the middle keeps infrared-dependent devices unobstructed. At 70 inches wide it needs a full wall run, so measure your space before ordering, and expect a two person assembly given the size of the panels.\n\nGlass shelf keeps IR devices unobstructed. On the other hand, 70\" footprint needs a full wall run. Neither should be a surprise once you know to look for it.",

The top panel supports up to 50 lbs, enough for most 55 inch TVs on their own stand, though it leaves little margin to also rest a heavy soundbar directly on top rather than on the open shelf below. Construction is composite wood with rounded corners and FSC-certified material, and assembly uses plastic locking tubes instead of only screws, which speeds up setup. This is a straightforward choice for a first apartment living room or a secondary TV space where budget matters more than storage depth or size. Simple tube-and-screw assembly. That's a real strength, but weigh it against the flip side: 50 lb top capacity is the lowest here.",

Three adjustable interior shelves and six cord management ports give it more configurable storage than most stands in this roundup, and the sliding doors hide media boxes without blocking infrared remote signals when left open. at a premium price this is the most expensive pick here, so it fits buyers who want a genuine furniture piece rather than a budget media shelf.

Storage is split between two open shelf bays and enclosed cabinet space, which keeps a router or streaming box accessible while hiding cable boxes and game consoles.

The two cabinets keep a cable box and streaming device out of sight while the flat top surface stays open for a smaller flat-panel TV and a compact soundbar.\n\nIts smaller footprint compared to the 58 to 70 inch stands elsewhere in this guide makes it a better fit for apartments, condos, or a secondary living room where a large media console would overwhelm the space. The two-tone brown and white finish leans neutral enough to match most existing furniture rather than committing to a single strong style statement.\n\nA genuine advantage here is that two enclosed cabinets hide clutter.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 7 best tv stand often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 7 best tv stand holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 7 best tv stand over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 7 best tv stand you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 7 best tv stand that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How tall should a TV stand be for a living room sofa?", a: "Most living rooms with standard sofas work best with a stand that puts the TV screen's center at 42 to 48 inches from the floor, matching a typical seated eye level. Measure your own sofa's seated height, since cushions can compress by 2 to 4 inches, and subtract half your TV's screen height from your eye level to estimate the ideal stand height rather than guessing from the stand's listed height alone." },
  { q: "Does a wider TV stand always look better than a narrow one?", a: "Not automatically. A stand should be at least 6 inches wider than the TV itself for visual balance, but going far wider than your sofa or the surrounding furniture can make the console look oversized for the room. Match the stand's width to your sofa's width as a proportion check rather than just filling available wall space." },
  { q: "Do fireplace TV stands come with the fireplace insert included?", a: "On the WLIVE pick in this guide, yes, the electric fireplace insert is included, though it ships in a separate box from the console and the two can arrive on different delivery days. Some other fireplace TV stand listings sell the console and insert separately, so check the listing description carefully before assuming a fireplace unit is bundled." },
  { q: "How much weight can a living room TV stand actually hold?", a: "It depends heavily on the model. Budget stands in this guide start around 50 lbs of top surface capacity, which comfortably covers most TVs alone, while furniture-grade options like the Walker Edison Richmond rate up to 150 lbs. If you plan to stack a soundbar and other equipment on the same top shelf as the TV, look toward the higher end of that range rather than the minimum." },
  { q: "Is a low-profile TV stand better than a tall console?", a: "It depends on your seating. Low-profile stands, generally under 18 inches tall, work well with low sofas, sectionals, or larger TVs where a tall console would push the screen center above comfortable eye level. Taller consoles around 24 to 28 inches suit higher seating or smaller TVs where a low stand would put the screen too close to the floor." },
  { q: "How do I keep cables organized behind a living room TV stand?", a: "Look for stands with multiple cable cutouts positioned near where your wall outlet and equipment actually sit, not just a single hole. Route power cables and HDMI cables through separate cutouts when possible to reduce tangling, and use hook-and-loop cable ties to bundle cords behind enclosed doors so equipment stays reachable without a full teardown." },
