export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Is it safe to run a MacBook in clamshell mode on a vertical dock?",
    a: "It can be, but airflow matters. A MacBook draws cooling air through its underside vents, and if a vertical stand's contact points sit flush against those vents, heavy sustained tasks can trigger thermal throttling within 20-30 minutes. Choose a stand, like the 4URPC MacBook Vertical Stand in this list, that leaves a genuine air gap at the bottom rather than flush contact.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why are the ports harder to reach on a vertical docking station?",
    a: "Vertical docks place their ports on top or along the side rather than flat on a desk, so plugging in a USB drive or headphones takes more reaching than a traditional flat dock. A short USB-C extension cable brought down to desk level is a simple fix if this becomes a daily inconvenience.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do vertical docking stations actually look clean, or is that just in photos?",
    a: "The vertical format itself does save real desk surface, but achieving a genuinely clean look in person still requires cable planning. The power cable running from the dock's adapter to the wall outlet is usually the last visible cable, a cable channel or clip along the desk edge solves this cheaply without needing a different dock.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy a purpose-built vertical dock or a separate stand and hub?",
    a: "A purpose-built unit like the PULWTOP 11-in-1 combines both into one piece and one cable, which is simpler. A separate compact hub paired with your own vertical stand, like the Baseus Spacemate or Plugable Triple Display, gives you more flexibility to choose each piece independently, at the cost of coordinating 2 products instead of 1.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why would I want a MacBook in clamshell mode instead of just using the built-in screen?",
    a: "Certain Apple Silicon chip generations only enable a second external display specifically while the laptop is in clamshell mode. A vertical stand makes running that configuration permanently a natural setup rather than something you have to re-trigger by closing the lid each session, as long as you handle thermal clearance correctly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a heavier laptop stable on a vertical dock stand?",
    a: "It depends on the stand's weight rating and base design. A vertical stand or dock holding a heavier laptop needs enough base width and weight capacity to resist tipping under vibration or an accidental bump. Look for a weighted base or cable-management clip attachment points if you're mounting a larger, heavier laptop vertically.",
