  "\"Modern\" TV stand is really an umbrella term that covers several distinct looks, from mid-century fluted and tambour doors to farmhouse-style sliding barn doors to minimalist black consoles with built-in LED lighting. Before you buy, it helps to know which sub-style actually matches your existing decor rather than assuming any stand labeled \"modern\" will blend in.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand modern often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand modern holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand modern over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand modern you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand modern that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: 'What does "modern" actually mean for a TV stand?',
    a: "It is an umbrella term rather than one specific look. In practice it covers mid-century designs with fluted or tambour wood doors, farmhouse-modern stands with sliding barn doors, and minimalist black consoles with steel frames and LED lighting. Check the exact door style and finish in photos rather than relying on the word modern alone to guess the aesthetic.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do sliding or fluted cabinet doors block my remote control?",
    a: "Yes, in most cases. Solid sliding, tambour, and fluted doors block the direct line of sight an IR remote needs, even when the doors are wood veneer rather than fully solid panels. If you plan to operate a cable box or streaming device with doors closed, look for stands with slatted or glass-front doors instead, or add a small IR extender kit.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much wider should a TV stand be than my TV?",
    a: "A few inches of margin on each side looks best. If your TV is 55 inches wide, a stand in the 58 to 65 inch range gives visual balance without looking oversized. Stands rated for a larger maximum TV size than your current TV are fine to buy ahead if you plan to upgrade the TV later.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a modern TV stand hold a mounted TV as well as a floor unit?",
    a: "It depends on the model. Floor-standing modern stands in this roundup are simply furniture the TV sits near or a separate wall mount handles the TV weight. Floating wall-mounted stands, like the HOOBRO pick here, combine the shelf and the wall attachment, so the wall studs need to support both the unit and any additional weight placed on its shelves.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a lower weight capacity stand still fine for a large TV?",
    a: "Usually the TV itself is not the main concern since most flat panel TVs weigh well under 100 lbs, but total load matters. A soundbar, cable box, game console, and decor items placed on the stand add up quickly. Choose a stand rated comfortably above your total expected load rather than the TV weight alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are steel-frame modern stands as sturdy as solid wood ones?",
    a: "They serve a different purpose rather than being strictly worse. Steel-frame stands, like the LED options in this roundup, tend to have lower weight capacity but a lighter, more minimalist look and often include built-in power outlets that wood stands do not. Solid wood mid-century and farmhouse stands generally offer higher weight capacity and a warmer aesthetic.",
