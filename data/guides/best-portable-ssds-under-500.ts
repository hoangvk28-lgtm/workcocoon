export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "At This Tier, Expect a Stated IP Rating, Not Just Durability Language",
    "explanation": "Given the price level, buyers should hold listings to a higher documentation standard than at cheaper tiers. A drive costing over $400 that only describes itself as \"durable\" without a specific IP rating or drop-height figure hasn't met the bar this comparison found several competitors clearing, like the matching IP65 ratings on the Samsung T7 Shield and Crucial X10. Treat the absence of a specific tested figure at this price point as a more meaningful gap than you might at a $50 tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity Jumps Can Cost Very Little at This Price Level",
    "explanation": "As this comparison shows, a 4TB drive can cost only about $13 more than a 2TB drive from a different brand at a similar durability tier, meaning the marginal cost of doubling your capacity is often small relative to the base price you're already paying. If there's any real chance you'll need more storage within the drive's useful life, the higher-capacity option often makes more financial sense than buying a second smaller drive later."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Same Brand Can Offer a Durability-Focused and a Speed-Focused Model",
    "explanation": "Some manufacturers, as seen with Samsung's T7 Shield and T9 in this comparison, sell two different models at a similar price and capacity that each optimize for a different priority, one for tested ruggedness, one for raw transfer speed. Don't assume two similarly priced drives from the same brand are redundant; check what each one specifically emphasizes before choosing, since the right pick depends on which tradeoff matters more for your use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bundled Software Trials Have an Expiration Date",
    "explanation": "Some drives at this tier include trial periods for photo management or backup software, like the three-month Mylio Photos plus and Acronis True Image trials bundled with the Crucial pick in this comparison. These are genuinely useful during the trial window but typically require a paid subscription to continue afterward, so don't treat a bundled trial as equivalent to permanently included software when comparing value across drives."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Full Rated Speed at This Tier Often Requires a Specific Host Port Generation",
    "explanation": "Several drives in this comparison rate up to 2000MB/s specifically over USB 3.2 Gen 2x2, a faster standard than the more common Gen 2. If your computer's USB-C port only supports standard Gen 2, you'll still get solid performance from these drives, but not the full advertised speed. Check your specific computer's port specification, not just the drive's rating, before assuming you'll see the top-line number in practice."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is it worth paying more for a drive with a stated IP rating at this price tier?", "a": "Generally yes, at this price point, several drives in this comparison do provide a tested IP65 rating and specific drop-height figure at little to no price premium over alternatives without one, like the Samsung T7 Shield and Crucial X10. There's less reason to accept vague durability language when tested alternatives exist at a similar cost." },
  { "q": "Should I get 2TB or 4TB if I'm not sure how much storage I'll need?", "a": "Given how small the price difference can be between capacities at this tier, roughly $13 in this comparison between a 2TB Samsung drive and the 4TB Crucial pick, it's often worth erring toward the larger capacity if there's any real chance you'll need it later." },
  { "q": "Why does the same brand sell two different drives at a similar price and capacity?", "a": "Manufacturers sometimes offer distinct models optimized for different priorities, one built around durability testing, another around raw speed, as seen with Samsung's T7 Shield and T9 in this comparison. Check which specific tradeoff each model emphasizes rather than assuming they're interchangeable." },
  { "q": "Do I need to keep paying for bundled photo or backup software after the trial ends?", "a": "Yes, bundled software trials like Mylio Photos plus or Acronis True Image typically require a paid subscription to continue using after the included trial period, commonly three months. Factor this into your decision if the software itself is a meaningful reason you're choosing one drive over another." },
  { "q": "Will I actually see 2000MB/s speeds on my current laptop?", "a": "Only if your laptop's USB-C port specifically supports USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. If it only supports standard Gen 2, you'll still get good performance, but well below the drive's full advertised speed. Check your laptop's exact port specification before assuming you'll see the top rated number." },
  { "q": "Is a 4TB portable SSD reliable enough to be someone's only backup?", "a": "A single drive, regardless of capacity, is generally not recommended as your only backup for irreplaceable files, since any single point of storage carries some failure risk. Even a well-rated, IP65-tested drive like the Crucial X10 in this comparison is best paired with a second backup location, like cloud storage or a separate drive, for anything you can't afford to lose." }
