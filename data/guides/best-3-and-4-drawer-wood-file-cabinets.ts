With more than 2,800 reviews at 4.1 stars, it has the most validated real-world usage data of any multi-drawer wood-look file cabinet in this format. This is a 3-drawer mobile unit, not a traditional vertical filing cabinet. It sits at desk height on wheels and includes open shelves in addition to the file drawers. The top surface is explicitly positioned as a printer stand. The rustic brown finish with black metal accents follows the farmhouse-industrial style common in the wood-and-metal home office category. Under $100 is excellent value for this feature set.",

    a: "No. A 3-drawer mobile file cabinet (like the DEVAISE) sits low, moves on wheels, and typically combines file drawers with open shelves. A traditional 3-drawer filing cabinet is taller, stationary, and designed purely for hanging files. Both store documents, but they serve different workflows.",

    q: "What is the best 3-drawer wood file cabinet?",
    a: "The DEVAISE 3-Drawer Mobile in Rustic Brown is the strongest pick by a wide margin: 2,800 plus reviews at 4.1 stars at $94.99. It includes rolling casters, open shelves, and a printer stand top. For a farmhouse honey-brown finish, the VASAGLE 3-Drawer is a good alternative, but verify the current drawer count and pricing on the listing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a 4-drawer vertical cabinet hold legal size files?",
    a: "Some can, but not all. Legal size files (8.5 by 14 inches) require a wider drawer than letter size. Check the specific listing for letter-and-legal compatibility before ordering.",
  },
  {
    q: "How heavy is a fully loaded 4-drawer file cabinet?",
    a: "A fully loaded 4-drawer vertical filing cabinet can weigh 100 to 150 pounds or more. Do not plan to move it frequently once loaded. Position it on hard flooring rather than thick carpet for stability.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do 3-drawer mobile cabinets fit under a standard desk?",
    a: "It depends on the cabinet height and desk clearance. A standard desk has approximately 29 to 30 inches of clearance from floor to underside. Most 3-drawer mobile units are 24 to 28 inches tall. Verify both measurements before assuming the cabinet will fit under your specific desk.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a 4-drawer lateral and a 4-drawer vertical?",
    a: "A 4-drawer lateral cabinet is wider and shorter, with each drawer spanning the full cabinet width. A 4-drawer vertical is narrower and taller, with each drawer extending the full depth front-to-back. Lateral cabinets take more wall space but are shorter. Vertical cabinets require less wall width but are significantly taller.",
