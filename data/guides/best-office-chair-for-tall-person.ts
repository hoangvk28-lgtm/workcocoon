  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What seat height do I need for an office chair if I'm 6'2\"?", a: "At 6'2\", your ideal seated position typically requires a seat height of 19 to 20.5 inches to keep your feet flat on the floor with knees at 90 degrees. Standard chairs that max out at 17 to 18 inches leave tall users sitting too low, which raises the knees above the hips and strains the lower back. Look for chairs that list seat height adjustability reaching at least 20 inches." },
  { q: "Is a gaming chair or an ergonomic office chair better for tall users?", a: "Gaming chairs designed for tall users (like the Secretlab TITAN Evo XL) use size-specific XL proportions but typically have leatherette surfaces that are less breathable than mesh. Ergonomic office chairs (Steelcase Leap V2, Herman Miller Aeron Size C) are more adjustable and more breathable but cost more. For all-day 8-hour work, ergonomic office chairs provide better sustained support. For 4 hours or less with gaming chair aesthetics, a properly sized gaming chair works well." },
  { q: "What is the difference between the Herman Miller Aeron Size B and Size C?", a: "The Herman Miller Aeron Size C has a physically wider and deeper seat pan, a taller back panel, and a higher seat height range than Size B. Size B is designed for users up to approximately 6'0\" and 230 lbs. Size C is designed for users above 6'0\" or with larger body frames. If you are 6'1\" or taller and sit in an Aeron Size B, the seat pan will likely feel narrow and the lumbar support may not align with your lower back." },
  { q: "Do I need a footrest with a tall office chair?", a: "Tall users rarely need footrests since the problem is typically the opposite: standard chairs are too low, forcing tall users to bend their knees below 90 degrees. A properly adjusted tall office chair should position your feet flat on the floor without a footrest. Only consider a footrest if your desk height is set higher than standard (above 30 inches) and you find yourself sitting with legs dangling." },
  { q: "How do I pair my tall office chair with a standing desk?", a: "Set your standing desk at a height where your elbows are at 90 degrees when standing. Then set your chair height so that your elbows are also at 90 degrees when seated at the same desk height. You may need to raise the desk a few inches above standard (28 to 30 inches) if you're tall. See our [standing desk for tall person](/guide/best-standing-desk-for-tall-person) guide for desk height recommendations by user height." },
