      "This YOOUSOO drawer attaches to the underside of a desk using a self-adhesive strip rather than screws or clamps, which means installation requires no tools, no drilling, and no damage to the desk surface. The drawer slides out horizontally from beneath the desk to reveal a hidden storage compartment sized for everyday small items such as pens, sticky notes, a phone charger, or a small notebook. A two-pack is included in a single purchase, which allows one drawer near the keyboard for frequently accessed items and a second drawer elsewhere on the underside for less-used supplies.\n\nThe white finish blends with the underside of most light-colored desks and does not draw attention when the drawer is closed. This configuration is particularly suited to renters in apartments who cannot drill into furniture and need a fully reversible storage solution. The adhesive bond requires a smooth, flat desk underside to adhere properly; textured, rough, or porous surfaces may not provide a reliable hold.",

Two separate drawers slide out independently, giving twice the storage capacity of a single-drawer option without taking up additional desk space horizontally.\n\nIntegrated cable management channels run along the underside of the unit to route power or data cables cleanly so they do not drape loosely beneath the desk. The metal construction is more rigid than plastic drawer options and supports heavier loads without flexing. Installing this unit requires drilling into the desk underside for a permanent mount, making it appropriate for homeowners or long-term office setups rather than renters. Buyers who need basic pen-and-notepad storage and are not concerned with security may find the price difficult to justify, but for those who specifically need a lockable under-desk solution with dual storage and cable management in one unit, there is no direct competitor in this roundup.",

The metal mesh construction resists bending and provides more durability than plastic drawer alternatives, which can crack or warp over time with heavier loads.\n\nThe drawer slides out horizontally beneath the desk to store small accessories, stationery, and everyday items within reach. To use this drawer the desk must have an exposed edge that falls within the clamp's adjustable range; desks with very thick tops, a lipped edge, or a frame that blocks the underside edge may not be compatible.

The ability to customize the internal layout is a meaningful advantage over drawers with a single open cavity, because items do not shift around or pile on top of each other when the drawer is opened or closed. A two-pack is included, allowing two drawers to be installed at different positions under the same desk or on separate desks.\n\nBostitch is a brand with a history in office products, which gives this drawer more name recognition than most generic options in this category.

The clear panels on each drawer let the user see the contents at a glance without sliding the drawer open, which reduces the time spent searching for specific items. The three-size system is designed to be used together as an organized under-desk station rather than as standalone units, and buyers who want a single purchase that covers multiple storage categories will find this the most complete adhesive option in the roundup.\n\nEach unit needs its own smooth, flat adhesive contact point on the desk underside, so a desk with sufficient flat surface area beneath is required.

Because it is a single-layer design, the unit sits closer to the desk underside than dual-tier alternatives, which makes it a better fit for desks with limited vertical clearance between the underside and the user's legs. Installation requires drilling, so this is appropriate for homeowners or anyone in a permanent office setup who is comfortable with a fixed mount.

A dual-tier design stacks two storage layers within the same under-desk footprint, effectively doubling capacity compared to a single-layer unit.
