export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Genuine 80Gbps Speed Requires Both a Thunderbolt 5 (or USB4 V2.0) Host and a Compatible Cable, Not Just the Enclosure Itself",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically note that achieving their full stated 80Gbps speed requires connecting to a genuine Thunderbolt 5 port (or USB4 V2.0 for the ACASIS pick) using a cable rated for that speed, meaning simply owning one of these enclosures doesn't guarantee 80Gbps performance if your computer's port or your cable doesn't support that specific standard. This matters because Thunderbolt 5 and USB4 V2.0 hosts are still relatively new and not present on many computers, so buyers with a Thunderbolt 4 or older host will only achieve 40Gbps speeds despite paying for 80Gbps-capable hardware. Confirm your specific computer has a genuine Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 V2.0 port, and that you're using a cable specifically rated for that speed, before expecting to see the full 80Gbps performance these enclosures are capable of."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An LCD Status Display Provides Genuine Diagnostic Value During Extended High-Speed Transfer Sessions",
    "explanation": "The MOKiN pick's LCD screen showing real-time temperature categorization and fan speed provides direct visual feedback during a transfer, letting you catch a developing overheating issue before it causes thermal throttling or potential data integrity concerns, a genuine diagnostic capability the other three picks in this comparison don't offer in the same visual form. This matters more for extended, data-critical transfer sessions like large project backups or extensive video renders, where knowing your enclosure's real-time thermal state adds confidence, and matters less for quick, routine file transfers where thermal issues are less likely to develop. Consider whether your typical use case involves long enough sustained transfers that real-time thermal monitoring would provide meaningful, actionable information."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Different Fan Activation Temperature Thresholds Reflect Different Manufacturer Approaches to Balancing Noise and Cooling",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS pick's fan specifically starts at 55 degrees Celsius and stops at 40 degrees, a notably higher activation threshold than the UGREEN pick's fan, which activates at 40 degrees, meaning the ACASIS design tolerates more heat buildup before engaging active cooling, prioritizing quieter operation for lighter workloads at the potential cost of running hotter before the fan kicks in. This matters if you're specifically sensitive to fan noise during typical light use but still want cooling available for heavier sustained transfers, where a higher activation threshold delivers more silence during normal use. Check a listing's specific stated fan activation temperature if the balance between quiet everyday operation and cooling responsiveness under load matters to your specific use pattern."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Manual Fan Override Capability Provides Proactive Cooling Control Beyond Automatic Temperature-Based Activation",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS pick specifically includes a manual fan override, letting you press and hold a switch to force the fan on proactively before starting a known-demanding transfer, rather than waiting for the enclosure to reach its automatic activation temperature threshold reactively. This matters if you know in advance that an upcoming transfer will be particularly large or sustained, where proactively engaging cooling before heat builds up can help maintain more consistent speeds throughout the entire transfer rather than experiencing a brief slowdown while automatic cooling catches up. Check for a manual fan override feature if you regularly know in advance when you're about to start a particularly demanding transfer and want proactive cooling control."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PCIe Gen5 SSD Compatibility Only Delivers Its Full Speed Benefit if You Actually Install a Genuine PCIe Gen5 SSD",
    "explanation": "The Qwiizlab pick specifically supports both PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4 NVMe M.2 SSDs, but the enclosure's stated maximum speeds are only achievable if you install a genuine PCIe Gen5-rated SSD inside it, since a PCIe Gen4 or older SSD will be limited to that drive's own maximum speed regardless of the enclosure's higher potential ceiling. This matters because buyers sometimes assume an 80Gbps-capable enclosure automatically delivers 80Gbps performance with any SSD installed, when the SSD itself is an equally important bottleneck in the overall speed equation. Verify your specific SSD's own PCIe generation and rated maximum speed, and confirm it matches or exceeds the enclosure's capability, before expecting to see the enclosure's full stated speed potential."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "If my computer only has a Thunderbolt 4 port, will these 80Gbps enclosures still work, just at a lower speed?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison specifically state backward compatibility with Thunderbolt 4/3 and USB4, so they'll function normally on a Thunderbolt 4 port, just capped at that generation's maximum 40Gbps speed rather than the full 80Gbps these enclosures are capable of with a genuine Thunderbolt 5 host." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when purchasing an 80Gbps enclosure at this tier?", "a": "Assuming any 80Gbps-labeled enclosure automatically delivers that speed with their existing computer and SSD, when actually achieving 80Gbps requires a genuine Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 V2.0 host port, a rated 80Gbps cable, and a sufficiently fast PCIe Gen5 SSD installed inside the enclosure." },
  { "q": "Is the UGREEN pick worth it over the cheaper ACASIS option?", "a": "If you specifically want the highest stated theoretical speed with a lower fan activation threshold and an included travel case, yes, but if you don't need Thunderbolt 3 backward compatibility and want genuine 80Gbps speed at a lower price, the ACASIS pick covers that for about $20 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my SSD is genuinely PCIe Gen5 rated to take advantage of the Qwiizlab's full speed potential?", "a": "Check your specific SSD's manufacturer specification sheet for its stated PCIe generation and interface speed rating, since only a genuine PCIe Gen5 SSD will approach the Qwiizlab enclosure's stated maximum sequential speeds, while a PCIe Gen4 or older SSD will be limited to its own lower maximum speed regardless of the enclosure's higher ceiling." },
  { "q": "Can the ACASIS pick's lack of Thunderbolt 3 compatibility be worked around with an adapter?", "a": "The listing specifically states the enclosure is not compatible with Thunderbolt 3 devices without qualification, so relying on a generic adapter to bridge this incompatibility isn't a reliable solution, making one of the Thunderbolt 3-compatible picks in this comparison the better choice if you specifically have a Thunderbolt 3-only host." },
  { "q": "Do any of these enclosures require external power beyond the Thunderbolt or USB connection?", "a": "All four picks in this comparison are designed to be bus-powered through the Thunderbolt or USB4 connection itself, without requiring a separate external power adapter, keeping them genuinely portable for use with laptops and other bus-powered host devices." }
