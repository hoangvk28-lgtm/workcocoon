export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Simultaneous Dual DC Output Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than a Single Switchable Voltage Output",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION 90W pick specifically provides two DC outputs functioning simultaneously, a fixed 24V and an adjustable 3-36V, letting you power two separate devices with different voltage requirements from one splitter at the same time, a fundamentally different capability than the switchable single-output splitters in this comparison that deliver only one voltage at a time regardless of how many voltage options they support. This matters significantly if your control cabinet needs to power multiple devices with genuinely different voltage requirements simultaneously, and matters less if all your devices share the same voltage need, where a simpler single-output splitter suffices. Check whether a splitter offers simultaneous dual output or just a switchable single output before assuming either type solves your specific multi-device, multi-voltage power need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DIN-Rail Splitters Requiring IEEE 802.3bt Are Explicitly Incompatible With Passive BT Power Sources",
    "explanation": "Both the LINOVISION 90W and ThePoEstore picks specifically warn against connecting them to non-standard BT PoE switches or injectors, including passive PoE versions, requiring instead a genuine standard IEEE 802.3bt PoE switch or injector to function correctly. This matters significantly if your existing PoE infrastructure uses a passive or non-standard power delivery method, since connecting these splitters to an incompatible source could result in improper power delivery or equipment damage. Verify your specific PoE switch or injector's exact standard compliance against a splitter's stated compatibility requirements before connecting, especially for higher-power 802.3bt-rated splitters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Two Different DC Connector Types on One Splitter Provide Real Installation Wiring Flexibility",
    "explanation": "The Industrial Din-Rail 60W pick specifically offers both a DC jack (5.5mm x 2.1mm) and a green terminal connector output, letting installers choose whichever connection method matches their existing equipment or wiring preference, rather than being locked into a single connector type. This matters if you're wiring into existing terminal-block infrastructure common in industrial control cabinets, or if your specific device requires a standard barrel jack connector, and matters less if you only need one connection type and your device already matches it. Check whether a DIN-rail splitter offers your specifically needed connector type, or multiple options for flexibility, before assuming any splitter's single connector type matches your installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Wide Adjustable Voltage Range Provides Genuine Flexibility Across Devices With Non-Standard Voltage Requirements",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION 90W pick's adjustable 3-36V output range, displayed on a real-time voltage LED panel, accommodates devices with non-standard or unusual voltage requirements that don't fall neatly into the common fixed 5V/9V/12V/24V tiers most other splitters offer. This matters if you're powering a specialized device like an adjustable LED fill light or a door controller with a specific voltage requirement outside the common fixed tiers, and matters less if your devices all use standard, common voltages already covered by a fixed or switchable splitter. Check whether your specific device's voltage requirement falls within a standard fixed tier or needs the flexibility of a genuinely adjustable output range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DIN-Rail Mounting Orientation Options Determine Installation Flexibility Within a Specific Control Cabinet Layout",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION 90W pick specifically states dual-sided DIN-rail mounting on both the back and sides of the unit, plus wall-mounted installation as an alternative, giving more physical placement flexibility within a control cabinet than a splitter with only one mounting orientation option. This matters if your specific control cabinet has space constraints that require a particular mounting orientation, and matters less if you have ample cabinet space where any standard DIN-rail mounting orientation would fit. Check a splitter's specific mounting orientation options against your actual control cabinet's physical layout and available space before finalizing your installation plan."

  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a DIN-rail PoE splitter?", "a": "Assuming any switchable multi-voltage splitter can power multiple devices at different voltages simultaneously, when most switchable splitters deliver only one selected voltage at a time regardless of how many voltage options they support." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION 90W dual-output splitter worth its higher price over the single-output picks?", "a": "If you genuinely need to power two devices with different voltage requirements simultaneously, the LINOVISION 90W pick's higher price is justified, but if all your devices share the same voltage need, a single-output switchable splitter delivers adequate function for less." },
  { "q": "Will these DIN-rail splitters work with a passive PoE injector instead of a standard switch?", "a": "The LINOVISION 90W and ThePoEstore picks both specifically warn against connecting them to passive or non-standard BT PoE sources, requiring a genuine standard IEEE 802.3bt PoE switch or injector to function correctly." },
  { "q": "How much power do I actually need for a PTZ camera on a DIN-rail splitter?", "a": "PTZ cameras with motorized functions or added accessories like wipers and IR illuminators often need more than the standard 30W tier, so checking your specific camera's exact wattage requirement against a splitter's 60-90W options is worth doing for demanding PTZ installations." },
  { "q": "Can I mount these splitters on a wall instead of a DIN-rail if my cabinet doesn't have rail space?", "a": "Several picks in this comparison, including the LINOVISION 30W and 90W dual-output splitters, specifically support both DIN-rail and wall-mount installation, giving you that flexibility if rail space is limited." }
