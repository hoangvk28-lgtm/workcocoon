  "Mini PC cooling stands exist to address a specific problem: compact computers can reduce sustained performance when internal temperatures rise during long CPU or GPU workloads. A stand is useful only when it improves airflow around the Mini PC's real intake and exhaust locations, so vent alignment matters more than a generic claim that the stand improves cooling.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the cooling accessory actually matches your mini PC's chassis shape and airflow design",
    "explanation": "Mini PC cooling accessories, whether a cooling stand, an external fan, or a cooling pad, work by improving airflow around the device's existing vents, so their effectiveness depends heavily on where your specific mini PC's own intake and exhaust vents are located, which varies meaningfully between brands and even between generations of the same product line.\n\nAn accessory designed to blow air upward into a bottom-vented chassis provides little benefit to a mini PC that vents primarily from the rear or sides, regardless of how much airflow the accessory itself generates, since the cooling benefit only materializes when moving air actually reaches the device's real intake points.\n\nCheck your specific mini PC model's vent locations (usually visible in official product photos or its spec sheet) before assuming any generically-marketed cooling accessory will meaningfully help."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that passive stands and active fans solve different problems",
    "explanation": "A passive cooling stand improves airflow purely through elevation and often an open or perforated design that lets ambient air circulate more freely around the chassis than sitting flat on a desk, requiring no power and adding zero noise, while an active cooling fan or pad genuinely forces air movement and can meaningfully lower temperatures under sustained heavy load in a way passive elevation alone cannot.\n\nThis matters because a passive stand is a reasonable solution for a mini PC that only occasionally runs warm, while a genuinely thermally-constrained device under sustained load, like one running a home server or transcoding video continuously, benefits more from active airflow that a passive stand simply can't provide regardless of its design quality.\n\nMatch the accessory type to your actual thermal problem: light everyday use rarely needs active cooling, while continuous heavy workloads benefit from genuine forced airflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the noise level if the accessory uses an active fan",
    "explanation": "Any cooling accessory with its own fan adds a new noise source to your desk or media setup, and the noise level, when disclosed at all, is typically given in decibels (dBA) measured at a specific distance, though sellers rarely specify testing conditions consistently, making direct comparisons across listings imperfect but still directionally useful.\n\nThis matters specifically because the whole point of many mini PC setups, home theater boxes and quiet home office machines especially, is to avoid the noise of a traditional desktop tower, and adding a loud aftermarket cooling fan can undermine that goal entirely.\n\nCheck for a stated noise level and prioritize fans with speed control if quiet operation matters, since a fan that can be throttled down during light use and sped up only under real load offers the best of both a quiet baseline and real cooling headroom when needed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify the power source, since not every cooling accessory is self-powered",
    "explanation": "Cooling fans and some cooling pads draw power either from a USB connection to the mini PC or host device itself, or from a separate wall adapter, and this distinction affects both setup complexity and whether the accessory turns on and off automatically with the device it's cooling.\n\nA USB-powered accessory typically only runs while the mini PC itself is powered on and providing that USB power, which is usually the desired behavior for cooling, while a separately wall-powered accessory needs its own outlet and stays on independently unless manually switched off, adding a cable and a decision point the buyer needs to plan for in their setup.\n\nCheck the listing's stated power source and confirm it matches how you want the cooling accessory to behave relative to your mini PC's own power state."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check physical clearance and desk space the accessory adds, not just its footprint",
    "explanation": "A cooling stand or external fan adds real height, width, or depth beyond your mini PC's own dimensions, and on an already-tight desk setup, this added footprint can conflict with a monitor stand, other peripherals, or the available desk depth in ways that aren't obvious from a product photo showing the accessory in isolation.\n\nThis is particularly relevant for stands that elevate the mini PC significantly or fans that mount to a specific side, since the resulting combined footprint of mini PC plus accessory is what actually needs to fit your space, not the accessory's dimensions alone.\n\nMeasure your actual available desk space with the mini PC's own footprint already accounted for, then check the accessory's added dimensions against what's genuinely left over, rather than assuming any accessory marketed as \"compact\" will automatically fit."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Can a cooling stand stop Mini PC thermal throttling?", a: "It can help only if it improves the machine's real airflow path enough to reduce temperatures under sustained load. A specific noise or temperature figure in the listing is more useful evidence than a vague cooling claim." },
  { q: "Does any cooling stand fit any Mini PC?", a: "No. Vent placement and chassis shape vary between Mini PCs, and several stands in this guide, like the ElecGear iNUC-K and CaSZLUTION stand, are built for one specific brand and generation. Check compatibility carefully before buying." },
  { q: "Is an active stand always better than a passive stand?", a: "No. Active airflow usually offers more cooling headroom, but it also adds fan noise and power use. A passive stand can be the better choice for lighter workloads and noise-sensitive desks." },
  { q: "Is aluminum automatically better than plastic or acrylic?", a: "Not automatically. Aluminum has better heat-conducting potential, but airflow alignment and actual contact still determine whether that material advantage matters in practice." },
  { q: "What evidence should I look for before buying?", a: "Look for a specific noise rating in dBA or a stated temperature drop with test conditions. Vague claims like 'improves cooling' with no numbers are weaker evidence than verified buyer feedback." },
