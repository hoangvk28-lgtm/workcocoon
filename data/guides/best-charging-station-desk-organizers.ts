    question: "Do charging station desk organizers work with any phone?",
    answer: "USB-port organizers (BESTEK, SooPii budget) work with any phone via cable. Wireless organizers (LADSTAG, TopMade, Satechi) work with any Qi-enabled phone -- that covers all iPhones since iPhone 8 and virtually all Android flagships since 2018. For 15W MagSafe speed, the phone needs to be iPhone 12 or newer and the pad needs to be Qi2-certified.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I hide cables from a desk organizer charger?",
    answer: "Use 30 cm cables from devices to the organizer (keeps slack minimal), route the organizer's power cord along the desk's back edge using adhesive cable clips, and if the organizer has a hollow base or cable channel, thread device cables through it. The Satechi 7-Port handles this better than any other pick in this guide.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a charging station desk organizer charge a laptop?",
    answer: "The organizers in this guide do not charge laptops -- they top up phones, earbuds, and tablets. For laptop charging alongside organized desk accessories, pair a compact USB-C GaN charger (like the Anker Nano from our small desk guide) with a separate desk organizer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a charging station desk organizer and a docking station?",
    answer: "A charging station desk organizer holds and charges personal devices (phone, earbuds, accessories) and provides storage for stationery. A docking station connects a laptop to monitors, ethernet, and USB peripherals. They solve different problems.",
  },
  {
    question: "What organizer features should I actually use?",
    answer: "Start by counting what's on your desk right now. If you only ever need a phone slot and a pen holder, don't pay for a unit with 6 compartments. Use the 'What Slots Do You Actually Use?' table above to match the organizer side of each pick to your actual desk contents.",
