  "Most laptop cooling pads draw their power directly from your laptop's own USB port, which means the fans compete with whatever else is drawing from that same port, and running on battery means the pad draws from your laptop's battery too. A genuinely externally-powered pad, one that includes a separate wall adapter, avoids both of those constraints entirely. Based on our research, only two products in this specific pool include a confirmed external power adapter in the box.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the pad's stated compatible size range against your laptop's real footprint, not its screen size",
    "explanation": "A laptop's advertised screen size, like 13 or 15.6 inches, describes the diagonal measurement of the display panel, not the physical width and depth of the laptop's base that actually sits on top of a cooling pad, and two laptops with the identical screen size can have meaningfully different base dimensions depending on bezel thickness and chassis design.\n\nCooling pad listings state a compatible size range in inches specifically because they're describing what base footprint fits their surface and fan layout, so treating the screen-size number alone as a fit guarantee is a genuine buying mistake, not just an imprecise shortcut.\n\nMeasure your laptop's actual width and depth, or find those dimensions in its own spec sheet, and compare that against the pad's stated range rather than matching screen-size numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that a wider-range pad isn't automatically better for a smaller laptop",
    "explanation": "Cooling pads spread their fans across the surface in a fixed layout designed around the middle of their stated compatible range, so a pad rated for 12 to 17 inches has its fans positioned to reach a wide variety of vent locations across that whole span, while a laptop toward the small end of that range may not sit directly over as many of those fans as it would on a pad sized more tightly around its own dimensions.\n\nThis matters because the cooling benefit of a pad comes specifically from airflow reaching the laptop's actual intake vents, not from the pad's overall surface area, so a smaller laptop on an oversized pad can genuinely get less effective cooling than the same laptop on a proportionally sized pad, despite technically fitting within the stated range.\n\nWhen your laptop sits toward one end of a pad's stated range rather than the middle, check user photos or reviews specifically describing that size laptop's fit before assuming the airflow lines up well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your laptop's actual vent location and design, especially for thin ultrabooks and MacBooks",
    "explanation": "Most cooling pads are designed around bottom-vented laptops, where intake vents sit on the underside of the chassis directly facing the pad's fans, but some laptops, most notably many MacBook models, use a fully sealed or fanless internal design where the chassis itself acts as a heat sink rather than relying on active airflow from underneath.\n\nThis is a genuine compatibility gap that a cooling pad's stated inch-range compatibility says nothing about, since a pad can physically fit a MacBook's exact footprint while providing essentially no cooling benefit if that specific model has no bottom vents for the fans to blow into.\n\nCheck your specific laptop model's actual cooling design (vented bottom panel versus sealed unibody) before assuming a cooling pad will meaningfully lower its temperature, and treat this as a separate question from simple physical size fit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh fan count and noise level together, not fan count alone",
    "explanation": "A pad's fan count, commonly ranging from a single central fan up to five or six smaller fans, is often marketed as a straightforward better-is-more spec, but more fans spinning simultaneously generally means more total noise output, and a pad with independently controllable fan zones lets you balance airflow against noise rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.\n\nThis is a real everyday tradeoff for anyone using a laptop in a quiet room or on a video call, since a cooling pad running at full multi-fan speed can become audible enough to be distracting, undermining the benefit if you end up turning it off to avoid the noise.\n\nCheck whether the listing states selectable fan modes or independently controlled fan zones, not just the total fan count, if noise control matters to your specific environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the power source and port type match your laptop before assuming plug-and-play compatibility",
    "explanation": "Nearly all cooling pads draw power over a USB cable rather than a separate power adapter, which keeps setup simple, but the cable end that plugs into your laptop is typically USB-A, and a laptop with only USB-C ports (common on newer ultrabooks and MacBooks) will need a separate USB-C adapter or hub to actually power the pad, an extra cost and cable that isn't obvious from the listing photos alone.\n\nThis matters because a cooling pad that can't be powered defeats its entire purpose regardless of how well it otherwise fits your laptop's size and vent layout, so it's a genuine prerequisite to check, not an afterthought.\n\nCheck the listing's stated cable connector type and confirm it matches an available port on your specific laptop, or budget for an adapter if it doesn't."

Always check which claim a specific listing is actually making." },
  { q: "Does external power drain my laptop's battery less?", a: "Yes, an externally-powered cooling pad draws from a wall adapter rather than your laptop's USB port, so it has no impact on your laptop's battery, unlike USB-powered pads." },
  { q: "Is external power always better than USB power for a cooling pad?", a: "Not necessarily. If you mainly use your laptop plugged into wall power already, the practical benefit shrinks. External power matters most for frequent unplugged use or when running the pad alongside other USB peripherals." },
  { q: "Why do some models from the same brand have external power and others don't?", a: "Manufacturers often position external power as a premium feature on select higher-end models within their lineup. Always check the specific model number's listing rather than assuming brand-wide consistency." },
