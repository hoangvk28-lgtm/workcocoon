export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Convert VA rating to real usable watts before sizing your equipment",
    "explanation": "A UPS's VA (volt-amps) rating is a marketing number, not the real power it can actually deliver, due to typical UPS power factor design, real usable wattage runs roughly 0.6 times the VA figure, meaning a 1000VA unit is usually rated for about 600W, not the full 1000.\n\nThis matters enormously when sizing a UPS against your actual equipment, buying based on the bigger-looking VA number instead of the real watts figure is a common mistake that leaves less real headroom than expected.\n\nAdd up your actual equipment's real wattage draw (not the power supply's maximum rating, but its typical operating draw), and compare that total against the UPS's stated watts number specifically, not its VA rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check waveform type against your power supply's compatibility requirements",
    "explanation": "A UPS outputs either a pure sine wave, matching the clean power from a wall outlet, or a simulated/modified sine wave, a rougher, stepped approximation that's cheaper to produce but can cause certain power supplies, particularly ones with Active Power Factor Correction (APFC), to buzz audibly or shut down unexpectedly when running on battery power.\n\nThis matters directly for a modern PC power supply, which very often includes APFC, running an APFC-equipped PC on a modified sine wave UPS during an outage can trigger exactly the shutdown you bought the UPS to prevent.\n\nCheck whether your PC's power supply is APFC-equipped (common in most modern units), and match it with a pure sine wave UPS specifically if so."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Estimate real runtime at your actual load, not the UPS's rated maximum runtime",
    "explanation": "Published runtime figures on a UPS listing are typically measured at a specific test load, often lower than what you'll actually draw with a PC and monitor running, meaning your real runtime during an actual outage will likely be shorter than the headline number suggests.\n\nThis matters because runtime is what actually determines whether you have enough time to save your work and shut down cleanly versus losing everything the moment the battery depletes.\n\nCheck whether the listing provides a runtime-at-load chart or calculator (many UPS brands publish one), and estimate your real runtime at your actual equipment's combined wattage draw, not the single headline runtime figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider AVR (Automatic Voltage Regulation) if your power is prone to sags or surges",
    "explanation": "AVR corrects minor voltage fluctuations, brownouts and small surges, without switching to battery power at all, extending battery lifespan by handling the vast majority of small power irregularities through voltage correction alone rather than draining the battery every time.\n\nThis matters more if you live somewhere with less stable grid power or frequent minor fluctuations, less in an area with consistently clean, stable power.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for AVR as a named feature, not just generic \"surge protection,\" which addresses a different, more severe class of power event."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check whether the internal battery is user-replaceable before the unit ages out",
    "explanation": "Every UPS battery degrades over 3-5 years of use regardless of how well the unit is otherwise built, and a model with a user-replaceable battery lets you extend the UPS's usable life for the cost of a battery alone, while a sealed unit with no replaceable battery means buying an entirely new UPS once the battery degrades.\n\nThis matters directly for total cost of ownership over several years, not just the upfront purchase price.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"user-replaceable battery\" language and confirm replacement batteries are readily available for that specific model before assuming any UPS supports this."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "How much real capacity does a 1000VA UPS provide?", a: "It varies by design. Standard lead-acid units typically provide around 600W of real usable capacity, while some lithium designs (like the GOLDENMATE picks in this guide) provide up to 800W, check the specific watt rating rather than assuming all 1000VA units are equivalent." },
  { q: "Is 1000VA enough for a workstation?", a: "For a lighter, single-GPU workstation load, generally yes. For a demanding multi-GPU or rendering-focused workstation, step up to a 1500VA pick with more real-watt headroom." },
  { q: "What's the benefit of a lithium battery UPS at this capacity?", a: "Lithium battery chemistry generally handles heat and repeated charge cycles better over the long term than the lead-acid designs most competitors use, worth the modest price premium if longevity matters to you." },
  { q: "Should I buy an 850VA or 1000VA UPS?", a: "If your setup is a basic single-monitor desktop, an 850VA pick like the APC BX850M offers nearly equivalent real capacity at a lower price. If you want more headroom or a lithium battery, a 1000VA pick is the better choice." },
