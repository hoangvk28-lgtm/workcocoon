  {
    q: "Is a 34-inch or 45-inch ultrawide better for gaming?",
    a: "34 inches is the more comfortable daily driver for most people, since a 45-inch screen demands more head rotation during long sessions and needs meaningfully more desk depth. The LG 45GS95QE in this guide is a solid 45-inch option if you have at least 30 inches of usable desk depth and want more immersion, but 34 inches remains the safer choice for all-day comfort.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the curve radius number, like 1500R or 1800R, actually mean?",
    a: "The number is the radius of the circle the curve is based on in millimeters, so a lower number means a tighter, more aggressive curve. The LG 45GS95QE's 800R in this guide is the most aggressive, designed to be viewed up close, while the 1800R QD-OLED picks use a gentler curve that still adds immersion without feeling as wrapped-around.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need QD-OLED, or is VA good enough for gaming?",
    a: "VA panels like the ASUS TUF VG34VQL1B and Alienware AW3425DWM in this guide deliver solid contrast and color for the vast majority of gamers at a fraction of the QD-OLED price. QD-OLED picks like the MSI MAG 341CQP add a real jump in contrast and response time, worth it if you're sensitive to motion blur or want the deepest blacks, but not strictly necessary for casual or competitive play.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a curved ultrawide work on a monitor arm?",
    a: "Yes, but curved panels shift the center of gravity forward compared to a flat monitor of the same weight, which can multiply the effective torque on an arm's tilt pivot by roughly 1.5-2x. Check that any arm you pair with the monitors in this guide is rated for that extra load, not just the panel's listed weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a higher refresh rate like 360Hz actually matter for casual gaming?",
    a: "The benefit of 360Hz, like the ASUS ROG Swift PG34WCDN in this guide, is most noticeable in competitive esports titles run at very high frame rates on a capable GPU. For casual or single-player gaming, the jump from 165Hz to 240Hz is far more noticeable than 240Hz to 360Hz, so most buyers are better served by one of the mid-tier picks in this guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the ASUS ROG Swift PG34WCDN only have 3 reviews?",
    a: "It's a newer, higher-priced release in this guide, so it simply hasn't accumulated review volume yet. Its 4.6-star rating is a good early signal but shouldn't be weighed the same as the AW3423DW's 722 reviews or the AW3425DWM's 604 reviews when deciding how much to trust the rating.",
