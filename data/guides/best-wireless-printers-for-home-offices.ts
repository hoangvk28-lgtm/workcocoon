export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand duty cycle as a maximum ceiling, not a healthy day-to-day volume",
    "explanation": "A printer's rated duty cycle is the absolute maximum number of pages it can print in a month before risking premature wear, not a figure representing comfortable, sustained daily use, printing consistently near that ceiling month after month accelerates wear on the print mechanism well beyond what the same printer would experience at a more moderate, realistic volume.\n\nThis matters because buying a printer rated just barely above your expected monthly volume often means running it closer to its stress limit than its comfortable operating range.\n\nCheck the listed duty cycle figure, and target a printer rated at 3 to 5 times your actual expected monthly volume for genuinely comfortable long-term use, not a printer rated just above what you think you'll print."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match multi-user wifi sharing to how many people will actually print from it",
    "explanation": "A printer's wireless sharing capability varies in real-world reliability between models, some handle multiple simultaneous connection requests from different devices smoothly, while others can drop connections or queue print jobs unreliably when more than one person tries to print around the same time.\n\nThis matters directly for a shared home office or household with multiple people printing throughout the day, less for a single dedicated user.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of multi-device wifi reliability, not just whether wireless printing is listed as a supported feature, since the feature existing and working reliably under real multi-user load aren't the same thing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check scan resolution against what you're actually digitizing, not just print quality",
    "explanation": "Print quality specs get most of the attention in printer listings, but scan resolution, measured in DPI, determines whether a scanned document stays genuinely readable when zoomed in or printed again later, and this spec is often buried or only briefly mentioned compared to print specs.\n\nThis matters more if you regularly scan contracts, receipts, or other documents where legibility of fine print matters, less if scanning is an occasional, low-stakes task.\n\nCheck the listed optical scan resolution in DPI specifically, not just the printer's overall feature list, if document scanning is a real part of your workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh whether legacy features like fax are worth paying for in a 2026 home office",
    "explanation": "Many home-office printers still bundle a fax feature as a holdover from an earlier era, adding to the printer's cost and complexity even though most home offices in 2026 will genuinely never use it, having largely moved to email and digital document sharing entirely.\n\nThis matters for value, paying for a feature you'll never touch is a real, if often overlooked, inefficiency when a fax-free model at a lower price covers the same core printing and scanning needs.\n\nCheck whether fax is a genuine requirement for your specific situation before treating its presence as a meaningful selling point, and consider a fax-free model if it isn't."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider ink versus toner cost per page for your actual print volume, not just the printer's price",
    "explanation": "An inkjet printer is typically cheaper to buy upfront but has a meaningfully higher cost per printed page than a laser printer using toner, a gap that adds up significantly over months of real use at moderate to high volume, while a laser printer costs more initially but can work out cheaper in total ownership cost if you print regularly.\n\nThis matters directly based on your actual expected volume, a low-volume occasional printer may never recoup a laser printer's higher upfront cost, while a high-volume home office likely will.\n\nCheck the manufacturer's stated or estimated cost-per-page for both ink and toner options, and weigh that against your realistic monthly print volume, not just the printer's sticker price."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "What's the difference between WiFi Direct and network WiFi on a printer?",
    a: "WiFi Direct has the printer create its own hotspot that your phone connects to directly, no router required. Network WiFi has the printer join your existing router network alongside your other devices, which is what all 8 picks in this guide use for standard home office setups.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my printer keep going offline after sitting idle?",
    a: "This is a widely reported pattern, especially with HP printers, where the printer disconnects from the network during idle periods and needs to reconnect before the next print job. Brother and Epson tend to show this less often by reputation. If it happens frequently, try disabling the printer's aggressive sleep mode in its settings.",

    q: "Is 5GHz WiFi actually better for my printer?",
    a: "Only if the printer sits close to your router with no walls in between. 5GHz is faster but has shorter range and worse wall penetration than 2.4GHz, so a printer in a separate room usually performs more reliably on the 2.4GHz band despite the lower theoretical speed.",

    q: "My router doesn't have a WPS button, how do I set up a wireless printer?",
    a: "All 8 picks in this list support app-based setup through the manufacturer's app, HP Smart, Canon PRINT, or Epson's app, as an alternative to WPS. This is especially relevant for mesh router systems like Eero or Google Nest WiFi, which commonly don't include a WPS button.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which printer brand has the most reliable wireless connection on a Mac?",
    a: "Brother and Epson tend to show fewer macOS-specific offline complaints by reputation, while HP is more frequently reported to have issues on Mac networks specifically. Canon falls in the middle. If Mac stability matters most, the Brother DCP-L2640DW or Epson EcoTank ET-2800 are the safer picks in this list.",
  },
  {
    q: "My printer shows as connected but still won't print, why?",
    a: "A common cause is an IPv4 versus IPv6 mismatch, if your router defaults to IPv6 and the printer only fully supports IPv4, it can appear connected but not actually reachable. Check your router's settings for an option to prioritize IPv4 for local devices, and also confirm the printer and your device are on the same network rather than a guest WiFi network.",
