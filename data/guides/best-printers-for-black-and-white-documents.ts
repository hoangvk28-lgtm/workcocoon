    q: "Should I buy a color printer or a dedicated mono printer for B&W use?",
    a: "If 90% or more of your printing is black-and-white, a dedicated mono laser like the Brother DCP-L2640DW or HP LaserJet M209d costs less to buy and less to run than a color printer used mostly in B&W mode. Only choose a color-capable option if you genuinely need color with some regularity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is toner-save or draft mode, and is it worth using?",
    a: "Toner-save mode prints using roughly half the toner per page, with a slightly lighter but still legible result. It's genuinely worth using for internal drafts and non-final documents, and it can meaningfully stretch a toner cartridge's lifespan.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is ghost imaging on a laser printer?",
    a: "Ghost imaging is when drum contamination causes faint repeats of a previous print to appear on later pages. It's usually a sign the drum unit needs cleaning or eventual replacement, separate from the toner cartridge itself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick in this list is best for grayscale photos specifically?",
    a: "The Epson XP-7100, a photo-focused color inkjet, produces the smoothest grayscale gradients in this list. Any of the laser picks will beat it on plain text sharpness but can show banding on photo-style grayscale content.",
