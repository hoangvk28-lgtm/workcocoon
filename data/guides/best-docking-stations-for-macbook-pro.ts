export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Why won't my dock drive two extra monitors on my MacBook Pro?",
    a: "This is almost always a chip limitation, not a dock problem. Base M1, M2, and M3 chips officially support only 1 external display in extended desktop mode regardless of the dock, while M1 Pro/Max, M2 Pro/Max, M3 Pro/Max, and M4 Pro/Max chips support 2-3 displays natively. Check your exact chip tier before assuming a higher-port-count dock will fix it, or consider a DisplayLink-based workaround for a base chip.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy a certified Thunderbolt dock or a cheaper USB-C hub for my MacBook Pro?",
    a: "For a MacBook Pro specifically, certified Thunderbolt is the more reliable choice, since Apple co-developed Thunderbolt with Intel and Macs support it natively, more so than the case for Windows laptops. If budget is tight and you just need basic port expansion and charging without Thunderbolt-specific peripherals, a broadly compatible USB-C hub like the Anker Laptop Docking Station 8-in-1 still works fine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 100W dock fully fast-charge my 16-inch MacBook Pro?",
    a: "Not always at full speed under heavy load. A dock rated for 100W typically delivers about 10-15W less to the laptop after the dock's own circuitry draws power, and a 16-inch MacBook Pro can need 100-140W or more under heavy load. For the fastest charging, prioritize the highest-wattage certified Thunderbolt picks in this guide, like the Plugable 16-in-1 or Anker Prime TB5.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is DisplayLink and should I use it on my MacBook Pro?",
    a: "DisplayLink is software that adds an extra display output through CPU-based compression rather than native GPU output, which is how a base M-series MacBook Pro can drive a second external display beyond its official 1-display limit. It works well for office productivity but introduces some input lag, so it's not ideal for color-accurate design work or gaming on that extra screen.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which dock in this guide is best for a MacBook Pro with a Pro or Max chip?",
    a: "The UGREEN 8-in-1 Thunderbolt 4 Docking Station explicitly lists compatibility with M1, M2, M3, and M4 Pro/Max chips and supports dual 4K@60Hz or a single 8K display, making it the strongest value pick for that chip tier. For the most demanding multi-4K/8K workflows, the CalDigit TS5 Plus Thunderbolt 5 dock is built for M3/M4 Pro/Max multi-display use specifically.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is CalDigit worth the extra cost over a generic Thunderbolt dock for Mac?",
    a: "CalDigit has a long track record as a Mac-first dock brand, and its TS4 and TS5 Plus docks are built with high port counts and bandwidth specifically for demanding Mac desk setups and multi-display workflows. If you need the highest port count or Thunderbolt 5 bandwidth for a Pro/Max chip Mac, it's a reasonable premium; casual dual-display users can get similar core functionality from the UGREEN or Plugable picks at a lower price.",
