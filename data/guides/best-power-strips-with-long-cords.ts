export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that a power strip and a surge protector are not automatically the same thing",
    "explanation": "A basic power strip simply splits one wall outlet into several without any electrical protection built in, while a genuine surge protector includes internal components (commonly metal oxide varistors) that absorb and redirect a sudden voltage spike before it reaches your connected electronics, and a joule rating, when stated, quantifies roughly how much total surge energy those components can absorb before needing replacement.\n\nThis distinction matters because these two product types are frequently sold side by side with visually similar designs, and a strip without stated surge protection provides zero defense against the kind of voltage spike that can damage a laptop charger, a monitor, or other sensitive electronics during a storm or grid fluctuation.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated joule rating and the words \"surge protector,\" not just \"power strip,\" if protecting connected electronics is part of why you're buying one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your specific mounting method's compatible dimensions before assuming it fits your setup",
    "explanation": "Power strips designed to mount rather than simply sit on a surface, clamp-on models that grip a desk edge, wall-mount models secured with screws, and under-desk models that attach to the underside of a desk, each have documented compatible dimension ranges (desk edge thickness for clamps, screw spacing for wall mounts) that don't universally fit every desk or wall, so a mounting design being the right general category doesn't guarantee it fits your specific setup.\n\nThis is a genuinely easy detail to overlook when focused on outlet count and features, but a clamp rated for a specific edge thickness range that doesn't match your desk, or wall-mount screw spacing that doesn't align with your available wall studs, means the mounting mechanism simply won't work regardless of how good the strip itself is.\n\nMeasure your actual desk edge, wall spacing, or under-desk clearance and compare it directly against the product's stated compatible range before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check combined USB wattage and port count against how many devices you actually charge at once",
    "explanation": "USB charging ports on a power strip vary meaningfully in both count and total combined wattage output, and this total wattage gets shared or allocated across all connected devices simultaneously, meaning a strip advertising a high total wattage figure with many ports can still deliver notably less power to any single device if several are charging at the same time compared to a strip with fewer ports but the same total wattage.\n\nUSB-C ports supporting Power Delivery (PD) can charge laptops and other higher-power devices meaningfully faster than basic USB-A ports, which are typically limited to lower wattage output regardless of what's plugged in.\n\nCount how many devices you'll realistically charge simultaneously and check both the per-port and total combined wattage figures, not just the raw port count, especially if laptop charging via USB-C is part of your actual use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check outlet spacing if you regularly plug in bulky wall adapters",
    "explanation": "Standard AC outlet spacing on a power strip assumes typical plug sizes, but bulky wall-wart style adapters (common for routers, some monitors, and certain chargers) can be wide enough to block one or even two adjacent outlets entirely, a real practical problem that a strip's total outlet count doesn't reflect if several of your devices use oversized plugs.\n\nSome strips specifically design wider outlet spacing or offset outlet positioning to accommodate this, a detail worth checking if your actual device mix includes multiple bulky adapters rather than assuming raw outlet count translates directly to usable outlet count.\n\nCount how many of your actual devices use oversized wall-wart adapters, and check listing photos or reviews specifically mentioning outlet spacing if that describes your setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since safety-critical categories deserve extra scrutiny",
    "explanation": "Power strips and surge protectors are electrical safety products, not just convenience accessories, and a listing with a strong rating built on a large, genuine review history provides meaningfully more confidence in consistent manufacturing quality and long-term reliability than a similar-looking product with only a handful of reviews, particularly relevant here since a failure mode in this category (a short, an internal fire risk) has real consequences beyond simple product disappointment.\n\nThis doesn't mean every lesser-reviewed product is unsafe, but it does mean the safety and durability claims on a thin-review listing carry less independently verified weight for a category where that verification genuinely matters.\n\nCheck for independent safety certification (UL or ETL listing) as a baseline requirement regardless of review count, and additionally weigh review depth more heavily here than you might for a lower-stakes product category."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Does a longer power strip cord reduce power delivery?", a: "It can, especially under sustained high load. A thin-gauge long cord run at length can experience measurable voltage drop over 15+ feet, though most consumer listings don't disclose the specific cord gauge." },
  { q: "Is it safe to coil excess power strip cord?", a: "Avoid coiling it tightly under sustained load. Bundled or coiled current-carrying cords can build up heat that a straight-run cord of the same length wouldn't experience, let excess cord lay loosely instead." },
  { q: "Can I run a long power strip cord under a rug?", a: "No, this is a real safety risk. Extension-cord safety guidance, not running cords under rugs or through doorways, applies directly to long power strip cords, since these behaviors reduce cord lifespan and create heat and trip hazards." },
  { q: "How do I know if a long cord's capacity is enough for my equipment?", a: "Check the joule and amperage rating separately from cord length, these are different specs. A very long but low-rated cord may not be appropriate for high-draw equipment at the far end." },
