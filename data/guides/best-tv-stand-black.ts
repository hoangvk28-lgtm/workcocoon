  "Black is the most versatile TV stand color on the market. It pairs with almost any wall color, flooring, or sofa fabric, and it visually anchors a TV setup better than lighter wood tones that can look busy against a patterned rug or textured wall.",
  "The finish matters more than the color itself. A high-gloss black surface photographs well online but shows dust, fingerprints, and pet hair within days of daily use, while a matte or textured black finish hides the same marks and needs far less upkeep. Buyers furnishing a small living room or bedroom should also weigh how a solid black stand affects the room visually, since a large dark block of furniture can make a compact space feel smaller than the same stand in a lighter finish.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand black often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand black holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand black over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand black you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand black that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Does a black TV stand make a small room look smaller?",
    a: "It can, depending on the finish and how solid the design is. A large, fully enclosed black cabinet reads as a heavier visual block than the same footprint in a lighter color or with open shelving. If your living room or bedroom is on the smaller side, an open-shelf black stand like the VASAGLE 3-tier will feel less bulky than a solid cabinet design, since visible negative space around the frame reduces the perceived weight of the piece.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a high-gloss black TV stand harder to keep clean than matte black?",
    a: "Yes. High-gloss surfaces and glass shelving show fingerprints, dust, and pet hair much more readily than a matte or textured black finish, because the reflective surface highlights every smudge under normal room lighting. This is rarely mentioned in product listings, which are usually photographed under studio lighting that hides the issue. If low maintenance matters more than showroom shine, choose a matte-finish stand.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size TV stand do I need for a 65 inch TV?",
    a: "Look for a stand at least as wide as your TV, and ideally a few inches wider on each side for visual balance and added stability. Most 65 inch TVs measure roughly 57 to 58 inches wide, so a stand in the 58 to 65 inch range works well. Several picks in this roundup, including the WLIVE 58 inch and VASAGLE 3-tier, are rated to support TVs up to 65 inches.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do LED TV stands use a lot of electricity?",
    a: "No. LED strip lighting on TV stands draws very little power compared to the TV itself, typically a few watts even with the lights on continuously. The bigger practical consideration is whether the lighting is app-controlled, which requires a stable WiFi or Bluetooth connection, versus a simple fixed-color or remote-controlled strip that works independently of your home network.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much weight can a black TV stand hold?",
    a: "It varies significantly by model, from around 110 lbs on lighter cabinet-style stands up to 360 lbs on heavy-duty metal-frame designs. Always add up your TV's weight plus any soundbar, console, or receiver you plan to place on the stand, and choose a model with meaningfully more capacity than that total, rather than cutting it close to the stated maximum.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose open shelves or enclosed cabinets for a TV stand?",
    a: "It depends on your equipment and how much you want visible. Open shelves keep cable boxes, routers, and consoles ventilated, which matters for devices that run warm continuously. Enclosed cabinets and drawers hide clutter and cables from view but can trap heat if the compartment isn't vented. If your setup includes an always-on modem or router, favor a stand with at least some open or ventilated shelving.",
