  "Genuine desktop color laser printers are rare and expensive in the home-office price range, since a color laser engine needs four separate toner drums instead of one. Of the 8 color printers we evaluated for this guide, only one, the Canon Color imageCLASS MF753Cdw II, is an actual color laser. The rest are ink-tank and cartridge inkjet printers, included honestly as the realistic alternatives most home offices end up buying instead, since a true color laser often costs 2-4x more than a comparable inkjet.",
  "We label each pick by its real print technology rather than blending them under a single 'color laser' banner, because the two engines have very different cost, size, and photo-quality profiles. Below you'll find the one true color laser in this roundup, plus ink-tank and standard inkjet picks that cover the same color home-office use case at a fraction of the upfront cost.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand duty cycle as a maximum ceiling, not a healthy day-to-day volume",
    "explanation": "A printer's rated duty cycle is the absolute maximum number of pages it can print in a month before risking premature wear, not a figure representing comfortable, sustained daily use, printing consistently near that ceiling month after month accelerates wear on the print mechanism well beyond what the same printer would experience at a more moderate, realistic volume.\n\nThis matters because buying a printer rated just barely above your expected monthly volume often means running it closer to its stress limit than its comfortable operating range.\n\nCheck the listed duty cycle figure, and target a printer rated at 3 to 5 times your actual expected monthly volume for genuinely comfortable long-term use, not a printer rated just above what you think you'll print."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match multi-user wifi sharing to how many people will actually print from it",
    "explanation": "A printer's wireless sharing capability varies in real-world reliability between models, some handle multiple simultaneous connection requests from different devices smoothly, while others can drop connections or queue print jobs unreliably when more than one person tries to print around the same time.\n\nThis matters directly for a shared home office or household with multiple people printing throughout the day, less for a single dedicated user.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of multi-device wifi reliability, not just whether wireless printing is listed as a supported feature, since the feature existing and working reliably under real multi-user load aren't the same thing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check scan resolution against what you're actually digitizing, not just print quality",
    "explanation": "Print quality specs get most of the attention in printer listings, but scan resolution, measured in DPI, determines whether a scanned document stays genuinely readable when zoomed in or printed again later, and this spec is often buried or only briefly mentioned compared to print specs.\n\nThis matters more if you regularly scan contracts, receipts, or other documents where legibility of fine print matters, less if scanning is an occasional, low-stakes task.\n\nCheck the listed optical scan resolution in DPI specifically, not just the printer's overall feature list, if document scanning is a real part of your workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh whether legacy features like fax are worth paying for in a 2026 home office",
    "explanation": "Many home-office printers still bundle a fax feature as a holdover from an earlier era, adding to the printer's cost and complexity even though most home offices in 2026 will genuinely never use it, having largely moved to email and digital document sharing entirely.\n\nThis matters for value, paying for a feature you'll never touch is a real, if often overlooked, inefficiency when a fax-free model at a lower price covers the same core printing and scanning needs.\n\nCheck whether fax is a genuine requirement for your specific situation before treating its presence as a meaningful selling point, and consider a fax-free model if it isn't."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider ink versus toner cost per page for your actual print volume, not just the printer's price",
    "explanation": "An inkjet printer is typically cheaper to buy upfront but has a meaningfully higher cost per printed page than a laser printer using toner, a gap that adds up significantly over months of real use at moderate to high volume, while a laser printer costs more initially but can work out cheaper in total ownership cost if you print regularly.\n\nThis matters directly based on your actual expected volume, a low-volume occasional printer may never recoup a laser printer's higher upfront cost, while a high-volume home office likely will.\n\nCheck the manufacturer's stated or estimated cost-per-page for both ink and toner options, and weigh that against your realistic monthly print volume, not just the printer's sticker price."

  {
    q: "Is every printer in this guide actually a color laser?",
    a: "No, and we want to be upfront about that. Only the Canon Color imageCLASS MF753Cdw II is a genuine color laser. The other 7 picks are ink-tank or cartridge color inkjet printers, included as honest, realistic alternatives since true color laser is rare and expensive at this price point.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is a true color laser so much more expensive than a color inkjet?",
    a: "A color laser engine needs four separate toner drums instead of the single ink or toner supply a mono printer uses, which raises both the manufacturing cost and the printer's physical size. That's why the Canon MF753Cdw II costs roughly 2-4x more than the ink-tank and inkjet alternatives in this list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is color laser better than inkjet for photos?",
    a: "No, this is one of the more misleading claims in printer marketing. Color laser handles text, charts, and solid graphics very well, but it's honestly weaker than a good inkjet or ink-tank printer for photographic gradients and skin tones. If photos matter, the Epson EcoTank or Canon PIXMA TR8620a in this list will look better.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the hidden long-term cost of a color laser printer?",
    a: "Beyond toner, the fuser unit typically needs replacing every 50,000-100,000 pages at roughly $40-80, a cost most buyers don't budget for upfront. Factor this into any multi-year cost comparison against the ink-tank or inkjet picks in this list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I just buy an ink-tank printer instead of a true color laser?",
    a: "For most home offices, yes. Ink-tank printers like the Epson EcoTank ET-4950 and ET-4800 avoid the idle-ink drying risk of cartridge inkjets and cost far less upfront than a true color laser, while still handling moderate color document volume well. Color laser only pulls ahead at genuinely high monthly print volume.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does color toner expire if I only print in black and white most of the time?",
    a: "Yes, opened color toner has a shelf life of roughly 2 years. If your household or office prints mostly black-and-white with occasional color, an ink-tank or cartridge inkjet avoids stocking color toner that may go unused long enough to matter.",
