export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Every '4K Projector' Under $200 Has a Native 1080P Panel, Not a Genuine 4K Display",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison state native 1080P resolution with 4K decoding support, meaning the projector's actual light-projecting chip only has 1080P worth of pixels, and any 4K content you feed it gets processed and downscaled to display at 1080P, a real technical distinction from a genuine native 4K panel that physically has four times as many pixels. This matters because the marketing term '4K projector' or '4K support' at this price point never means what it implies for image sharpness, and buyers expecting true 4K detail will be disappointed regardless of which budget pick they choose. Understand that '4K decoding' or '4K support' at this tier means the projector accepts and processes 4K source files, not that it displays them at native 4K resolution, before comparing based on resolution claims alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "ANSI Lumens Is a Standardized Brightness Measurement Worth Comparing Directly, Unlike Generic 'Lumens' Claims",
    "explanation": "ANSI lumens is measured using a standardized industry testing method across multiple points on the screen, making it a more reliable, comparable figure than a generic 'lumens' number that manufacturers can measure using less rigorous or standardized methods, sometimes inflating the perceived brightness. This matters because the picks in this comparison specifically state ANSI lumens (ranging from 800 to 3500), giving you genuinely comparable figures, unlike listings elsewhere in the broader market that cite unqualified lumens numbers that don't reflect real-world brightness as accurately. Prioritize projectors with a stated ANSI lumens figure over ones citing only generic lumens, and treat the ANSI number as the more trustworthy basis for brightness comparison."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Officially Licensed Streaming Apps Differ From Generic App Store Access in Reliability and Update Support",
    "explanation": "The Netflix Built-in pick specifically states its Netflix access is officially licensed, meaning the app is directly supported and updated by Netflix through a formal partnership, while a generic Android app store installation of Netflix (or a similar streaming app) on other budget projectors can sometimes break with app updates or lack official support if issues arise. This matters if you specifically prioritize Netflix as your primary streaming service, where official licensing provides more assurance of long-term compatibility and support. Check whether a listing specifically states 'officially licensed' for a particular streaming service you care about, rather than assuming any projector with a general app store provides equally reliable access to that same service."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Solves a Real Setup Problem in Rooms With Furniture or Decor Between Projector and Screen",
    "explanation": "The Magcubic pick's dynamic obstacle avoidance feature automatically adjusts the projected image to avoid interference from objects positioned between the projector and the screen or wall, a genuinely useful feature if your room layout doesn't offer a completely clear line of sight. This matters more in smaller rooms or unconventional layouts where furniture, light fixtures, or decor might partially obstruct the projection path, and matters less in a dedicated, clear home theater setup with no obstacles. Consider your actual room layout and whether obstacles genuinely interfere with your intended projection path before treating this feature as a meaningful differentiator over a simpler auto-focus-only design."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Manual Focus Requires More Setup Effort Than Auto Focus but Can Offer More Precise Control in Practice",
    "explanation": "The HAPPRUN pick specifically uses manual focus rather than the automatic focus systems on the other three picks in this comparison, meaning you'll need to physically adjust the lens for sharpness each time you reposition the projector, a real tradeoff for its lower price point. This matters if you plan to move the projector between locations frequently, where auto focus saves meaningful setup time, and matters less if the projector will stay in one fixed position most of the time, where a one-time manual focus adjustment is a minor inconvenience. Consider how often you'll reposition the projector before deciding whether auto focus is worth paying more for over manual focus."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will these budget '4K projectors' actually display 4K movies in true 4K resolution?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison have native 1080P display panels that decode and downscale 4K source content to 1080P, so while they can accept and process 4K files, the actual projected image resolution is 1080P, not genuine 4K." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing brightness between these budget projectors?", "a": "Comparing generic 'lumens' figures from other market listings against the ANSI lumens figures stated by these four picks, when ANSI lumens is a standardized, more reliable measurement that isn't directly comparable to unqualified lumens claims elsewhere." },
  { "q": "Is the Netflix Built-in pick worth it over the cheaper HAPPRUN option?", "a": "If you specifically want officially licensed Netflix access and the highest stated brightness, yes, but if you just want solid streaming access and Dolby Audio at the lowest price, the HAPPRUN pick covers that for about $40 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my room is dark enough for these budget projectors to look good?", "a": "As a general rule, the higher a pick's ANSI lumens figure, the better it performs with some ambient light present, so the 3500 ANSI Netflix Built-in pick handles brighter rooms better than the 800 ANSI Magcubic or X6 picks, which perform best in fully darkened spaces." },
  { "q": "Do any of these projectors require a separate streaming device like a Fire Stick?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison include built-in streaming capability through either an Android-based app store or a dedicated streaming system, so none require an external TV stick or dongle for basic streaming access." },
  { "q": "Can these budget projectors be used for gaming without noticeable lag?", "a": "These budget picks aren't specifically designed or marketed for competitive gaming with low input lag figures, so if gaming performance is a priority, checking for projectors with explicitly stated low input lag specifications in a higher tier is worth doing before assuming any budget projector handles gaming well." }
