export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rated Power Delivery Wattage and Actual Delivered Wattage Aren't Always the Same Number",
    "explanation": "A switch rated for 100W Power Delivery, like one pick in this comparison, may actually deliver less to the connected laptop in practice, the listing itself states 73-85W actual charging due to line loss and cable resistance, a detail worth knowing before assuming the rated number is exactly what reaches your device. When comparing charging capability between switches, look for listings that disclose this real-world figure rather than only advertising the theoretical maximum."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "EDID Emulation Prevents a Genuinely Annoying Window-Repositioning Problem",
    "explanation": "Without EDID emulation, switching between computers on a multi-monitor KVM setup can cause your operating system to forget window positions and reset them to a default arrangement each time you switch, since the display loses its remembered configuration momentarily. A switch with dedicated EDID emulation, like the ON/OFF dial on one pick in this comparison, stores the display's information persistently so your window layout stays consistent across switches, a real quality-of-life improvement for anyone switching frequently throughout the day."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirmed Apple Silicon Compatibility Is Worth Verifying Directly, Not Assuming",
    "explanation": "Some KVM switches work flawlessly with Intel-based Macs but have compatibility quirks with Apple's M1/M2/M3 chip architecture due to how these chips handle external display and USB-C signaling differently. A listing that specifically states confirmed compatibility with M1/M2 chip MacBooks, like the ATEN US3310 in this comparison, is a stronger signal of real-world tested compatibility than a generic \"works with Mac\" claim that doesn't specify chip generations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Hybrid Multi-Input Switch Solves a Real Problem for Non-Uniform Office Hardware",
    "explanation": "Many small offices accumulate a mix of computer hardware over time, a newer USB-C laptop alongside older desktops using DisplayPort or HDMI, and a KVM switch requiring identical connector types across all inputs simply can't accommodate this reality. A hybrid switch designed to accept different connector combinations across its ports, like one pick in this comparison, directly solves this real-world mismatch rather than forcing you to standardize your hardware just to use a KVM switch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Switching Speed Matters More the More Often You Actually Switch",
    "explanation": "A stated 2-second switch time, like on one ATEN pick in this comparison, matters significantly more for someone toggling between a work laptop and personal computer dozens of times throughout the day than for someone who switches once in the morning and once at night. If your workflow involves frequent switching, prioritize a pick with explicitly stated fast switching and lag-elimination technology over one that only advertises maximum resolution."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the ATEN US3311's 100W Power Delivery fully charge a power-hungry gaming laptop?", "a": "It depends on the specific laptop's charging requirements; 100W covers most standard and even many higher-power ultrabooks, but some gaming laptops requiring 130W or more chargers may charge more slowly or not keep pace during heavy simultaneous use through this switch." },
  { "q": "Can I use the hybrid 4-port switch with just two computers instead of the full four it supports?", "a": "Yes, the switch supports up to four different computers but doesn't require using all four ports simultaneously; you can connect just two devices and leave the remaining ports unused without any functional downside." },
  { "q": "Does EDID emulation need to be manually turned on, or is it automatic?", "a": "On the hybrid pick in this comparison, EDID emulation is controlled through a dedicated ON/OFF dial, meaning you manually enable or disable it based on whether your specific setup benefits from window-position stability or encounters compatibility issues with it enabled." },
  { "q": "What's the practical difference between the ATEN US3311 and US3310 for a typical home office user?", "a": "The US3311 offers higher resolution (up to 144Hz) and more charging power (100W), while the US3310 offers faster stated switching speed (2 seconds) and confirmed Apple M1/M2 compatibility at a lower resolution ceiling (4K@30Hz); most home office users switching between a laptop and desktop would find either sufficient, with the choice coming down to whether display quality or switching speed matters more." },
  { "q": "Do I need special cables for the 3-monitor 4-computer KVM switch, or will standard HDMI and DisplayPort cables work?", "a": "Standard HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 cables work, but the listing specifically recommends using high-quality, shorter cables to maintain a stable 8K or 4K@144Hz signal, since longer or lower-quality cables can cause signal degradation at these higher resolutions and refresh rates." },
  { "q": "Is a KVM switch dock like the ATEN picks a good replacement for a separate laptop docking station?", "a": "Yes, both ATEN picks in this comparison combine KVM switching with genuine docking station functionality, including USB hub ports and charging, meaning they can replace a separate dedicated dock if you're also switching between two computers, though a standalone dock might offer more total ports if you don't need the switching feature." }
