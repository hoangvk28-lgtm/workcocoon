All-in-one KVM docks split one connection across switching logic, display outputs, and USB simultaneously, which can add latency and reduce effective bandwidth compared to a dedicated dock, and most use USB-C with proprietary switching rather than a certified Thunderbolt chipset.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "What is the real difference between a KVM dock and a regular dock with a separate KVM switch?",
    a: "An all-in-one KVM dock combines switching logic, display outputs, and USB into a single device, which is convenient but can add latency and reduce effective bandwidth compared to a dedicated dock. Most KVM docks use USB-C with proprietary switching instead of a certified Thunderbolt 4 chipset. A separate dock plus a separate KVM switch preserves full dock-level specs at the cost of an extra device and more cables.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why won't my keyboard's hotkey switch between computers?",
    a: "KVM hotkey switching relies on the keyboard following the standard HID protocol. Gaming keyboards with custom firmware can fail to trigger the hotkey silently. If switching stops working, try a basic wired USB keyboard to confirm whether the keyboard or the dock is the actual cause.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will both of my laptops charge at full speed through a KVM dock?",
    a: "Usually not. KVM docks commonly provide full power delivery to the actively connected computer and reduced power to the idle one, so the laptop not currently in focus may charge slower even while connected. If both laptops need full-speed charging at the same time, a separate dock per laptop is a better fit than an all-in-one KVM dock.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do webcams and USB audio devices switch automatically with a KVM dock?",
    a: "It depends on the dock and device. Most KVM docks reliably switch keyboard and mouse, but USB storage, webcams, and audio interfaces may or may not switch together, and some devices need to re-initialize after a switch. Test your specific peripheral set, especially before an important video call, rather than assuming full switching.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a KVM dock a good option for a Mac and Windows mixed setup?",
    a: "It works, but expect extra reconfiguration. macOS does not automatically reapply display arrangement or input device settings when switching away from and back to a KVM connection, so you may need to adjust display layout and input settings after each switch rather than getting a seamless handoff like an all-Windows or all-Mac setup provides.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I skip a KVM dock and buy a separate KVM switch instead?",
    a: "If you need full dock performance, such as 100W+ actual power delivery, 4K120Hz output, or certified Thunderbolt 4 bandwidth, a separate KVM switch paired with two individual full-spec docks is the better approach. An all-in-one KVM dock makes more sense for price-conscious setups where some spec compromise is acceptable.",
