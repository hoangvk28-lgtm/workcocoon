The wobble at maximum height is noticeable but not problematic for a stationary standing work session. If you type aggressively at standing height or use a heavy monitor arm, dual motor is worth the premium.",

    q: "How long does a standing desk last?",
    a: "Budget standing desks with 1-2 year warranties typically last 3-7 years with regular use before motor or controller issues arise. The Vari Essential's 5-year warranty reflects higher build confidence. Commercial-grade frames are designed for 10+ years.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an anti-fatigue mat?",
