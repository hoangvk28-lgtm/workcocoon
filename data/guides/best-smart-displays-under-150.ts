export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Voice Assistant Ecosystem Compatibility Should Be Checked Against Your Existing Smart Home Devices First",
    "explanation": "The Google Nest Hub works with Google Assistant while the Echo Show and Echo Spot picks all run on Alexa, and these ecosystems don't always integrate seamlessly with each other's smart home devices, meaning a smart light or plug built specifically for Alexa may not respond to voice commands through a Google-based display, or vice versa. Buying a smart display before checking this compatibility can mean losing voice control over devices you already own. Check your existing smart home device compatibility documentation for which ecosystem, Alexa or Google Assistant, they're actually built to work with before choosing a display."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In Smart Home Hub Eliminates a Separate Piece of Hardware Some Buyers Don't Realize They'd Need",
    "explanation": "The Echo Show 8 pairs and controls Zigbee, Matter, and Thread devices directly without needing a separate smart home hub, while smart home devices using these protocols typically require a dedicated hub device to function if your smart display doesn't include one built in. This matters specifically if you're building out a smart home system with devices using these newer protocols, since skipping a hub-equipped display could mean an unexpected additional purchase later. Check whether your planned smart home devices use Zigbee, Matter, or Thread, and whether your chosen display includes built-in hub support for those protocols."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certified Refurbished Condition on a Smart Display Carries the Same Warranty as New, Making It a Genuinely Lower-Risk Way to Save Money",
    "explanation": "The Like-New Echo Show 8 is specifically tested and certified to look and work like new, backed by the same limited warranty a brand-new unit receives, meaning the refurbished condition doesn't reduce your consumer protection the way a private third-party used sale typically would. This lets you access a larger, more capable screen size at a price point closer to a smaller new model, a genuine value opportunity rather than a compromise. Check specifically for manufacturer-certified refurbished status and matching warranty terms before assuming any used or refurbished listing carries the same protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Physical Privacy Control Like a Camera Shutter Provides Assurance a Software Toggle Alone Doesn't",
    "explanation": "The Echo Show 5 specifically includes a built-in camera shutter alongside its mic/camera off button, a physical, mechanical block on the camera lens that provides visual, tangible confirmation the camera can't capture video, distinct from a software-based privacy toggle that requires trusting the device's settings menu. This matters more for a device that lives in a bedroom or other private space, where visual confirmation of blocked camera access offers genuine peace of mind beyond a settings-based assurance. Check specifically for a physical camera shutter or cover, not just a software mute toggle, if camera privacy is a priority for your placement of the device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Round Alarm Clock Form Factor Serves a Genuinely Different Purpose Than a Flat Rectangular Display",
    "explanation": "The Echo Spot's round design and dedicated eero mesh WiFi extender functionality make it purpose-built for nightstand use in a way the flat-panel Echo Show or Nest Hub picks aren't specifically optimized for, even though those larger displays could technically also sit on a nightstand. If your primary use case is a bedside alarm clock with basic glanceable information rather than video browsing or recipe following, the Echo Spot's form factor and bonus WiFi extension offer real value the larger displays don't specifically target. Match the device's form factor to your actual primary use case rather than defaulting to the largest available screen."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a Google Nest Hub work with my existing Alexa-compatible smart home devices?", "a": "Not reliably for voice control, since the Nest Hub runs Google Assistant, and many Alexa-specific smart home devices aren't designed to respond to Google Assistant voice commands, so check your existing devices' actual ecosystem compatibility before switching." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between the Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8?", "a": "Assuming the smaller, cheaper Echo Show 5 is always the better value, when a certified refurbished Echo Show 8 like the Like-New pick in this comparison can offer a meaningfully larger screen and built-in smart home hub for only about $35 more than the new Echo Show 5." },
  { "q": "Is a certified refurbished Echo Show 8 as reliable as buying new?", "a": "Yes, Amazon's Like-New program specifically tests and certifies these units to look and work like new, backing them with the same limited warranty a new device receives, making it a lower-risk way to access a larger screen at a reduced price." },
  { "q": "Does the Echo Spot's WiFi extender feature require a separate eero device to work?", "a": "Yes, it specifically extends an existing eero mesh WiFi network, so you'd need to already have or set up an eero system for this bonus feature to provide additional coverage." },
  { "q": "How do I decide if I need a smart display with a built-in camera or one without?", "a": "If video calling or home monitoring matters to you, choose a camera-equipped pick like the Echo Show 5 or Echo Show 8, but if you're mainly interested in voice control and glanceable information without video capability, the Echo Spot's lack of a full touchscreen camera view may still suit basic needs." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Echo Show 5's privacy shutter and still receive video call notifications?", "a": "Yes, closing the physical camera shutter only blocks the camera from capturing video, so you'll still see and hear incoming call notifications on the display and can choose to open the shutter before answering if you want to enable video." }
