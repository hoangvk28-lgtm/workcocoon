export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "macOS Handles Dual External Displays Fundamentally Differently Than Windows on Most USB-C Docks",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN and Plugable picks both specifically disclose that macOS either mirrors both external displays identically or limits the Mac to a single external monitor entirely, a hard platform-level limitation that has nothing to do with the dock's own hardware quality. This matters significantly if you're a Mac user expecting independently extended dual displays from any dual-HDMI dock, and matters less if you're on Windows where extended dual-display support is the norm across all four picks. Check a dock's specific macOS behavior disclosure (mirror mode, single display, or full dual extension) before assuming dual HDMI ports automatically mean independent extended displays on your Mac."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Native Uncompressed Video Delivers Genuinely Higher Fidelity Than DisplayLink-Style Compressed Video",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick specifically states its dual 4K 120Hz output uses uncompressed video powered by your laptop's native GPU, a meaningfully different and higher-fidelity video path than docks relying on DisplayLink software compression to drive multiple displays from a single video output. This matters if you do color-sensitive creative work or simply want the cleanest possible image quality, where compression artifacts from DisplayLink-based solutions can be noticeable, and matters less for general office productivity where compressed video is visually indistinguishable. Check whether a dock specifically states native GPU-powered video versus DisplayLink or similar compression technology if image fidelity is a priority for your specific use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Maximum Stated Resolution Still Depends on Your Laptop's Host Display Output Capability",
    "explanation": "The Plugable pick's listing specifically states that dual 4K 60Hz requires a host that supports higher-end display output, meaning the dock's headline resolution figure is a ceiling only achievable with a sufficiently capable laptop, not a guarantee for every USB-C laptop regardless of its own specs. This matters if you're pairing the dock with an older or entry-level laptop, where you may not actually achieve the dock's full advertised resolution, and matters less with a recent, capable laptop. Check your specific laptop's own DisplayPort Alt Mode and MST capabilities against the dock's stated resolution requirements before assuming you'll get the full advertised display quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Data-Only USB Ports on a Budget Dock May Not Support Charging, Video, or Audio Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN pick specifically notes that its 10Gbps USB A and C ports do not support charging, video, or audio transfer, meaning these ports are purely for data transfer despite looking like standard USB-C or USB-A ports that might otherwise be assumed to handle multiple functions. This matters if you're planning to use every port on a budget dock for multiple purposes, where you might be surprised a specific port doesn't do what you expected, and matters less if you only need those ports for basic data transfer as intended. Read a listing's specific per-port functionality notes carefully on lower-priced docks, since budget designs sometimes limit individual ports to fewer functions than a pricier dock's equivalent ports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Vertical Dock Design Trades Desk Footprint for Depth, Which Matters on a Small Desk",
    "explanation": "The MOKiN pick's upright vertical design with a magnetic base is specifically intended to minimize horizontal desk footprint by extending upward instead, a genuinely different space tradeoff than the flat, low-profile designs of the other three picks in this comparison. This matters if you have a shallow desk where horizontal space is at a premium, where the vertical design frees up more usable surface area, and matters less on a deep desk where a flat dock's footprint is already a non-issue. Consider your specific desk's dimensions and whether vertical or horizontal space is more constrained before choosing based on port features alone."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the StarTech dock work with my MacBook for dual HDMI displays?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states this dock is not compatible with macOS, so Mac users specifically needing dual HDMI should choose the MOKiN pick instead, which specifically states MacBook dual-display mode support." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a dual HDMI USB4 dock?", "a": "Assuming any dock with two HDMI ports will deliver independent extended displays on a Mac, when most docks in this category either limit macOS to mirror mode or a single external display due to platform-level limitations, not dock hardware quality." },
  { "q": "Is the StarTech dock worth the extra cost over the Plugable pick if I only need standard 4K 60Hz?", "a": "If your monitors and use case only need standard 4K@60Hz, the Plugable pick's lower price already covers that need well, but if you specifically want the higher 4K@120Hz refresh rate and IT deployment features, the StarTech's higher price is justified." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my laptop supports the DisplayPort Alt Mode with MST needed for dual HDMI extension?", "a": "Checking your specific laptop manufacturer's documentation for confirmed USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode with Multi-Stream Transport (MST) support is worth doing before purchase, since not every USB-C port on every laptop supports this specific combination." },
  { "q": "Can I use the UGREEN dock's USB-C ports for charging my phone while docked?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states the 10Gbps USB A and C data ports do not support charging, so a separate charging port or cable would be needed for phone charging while the dock is connected." },
  { "q": "Does the MOKiN dock's vertical design make it harder to reach the ports?", "a": "The vertical design specifically includes a built-in LCD screen showing per-port connection status to help with monitoring, and most ports are positioned for accessibility despite the upright orientation, though checking the specific port placement in product images before purchase can help confirm it suits your desk arrangement." }
