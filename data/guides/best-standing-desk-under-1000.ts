export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is a $300 standing desk worth buying over a $150 one?", a: "Yes, for most daily users. The $150 to $200 range buys a single motor, basic keypad, and limited warranty. The $250 to $350 range buys a dual motor (better stability), a longer warranty (5 years vs 1 to 2), more surface color options, and often anti-collision sensors. For a desk used 5 or more hours daily, the dual motor and longer warranty make the extra $100 to $150 a good investment." },
  { q: "What is the difference between FLEXISPOT and Vari standing desks?", a: "FLEXISPOT makes a wide range of desks from budget single-motor models to premium dual-motor bamboo frames, with most sold direct-to-consumer at competitive prices. Vari builds all their desks to BIFMA commercial certification standards, which adds durability testing but also adds cost. Vari desks ship from US warehouses with fast delivery. FLEXISPOT offers more color and size options. For a budget, FLEXISPOT offers more choice; for commercial durability standards, Vari is the better pick." },
  { q: "Is UPLIFT worth $1000 vs a $300 FlexiSpot?", a: "For a desk used 8 hours daily for 5 or more years, yes. The UPLIFT V3 has a 15-year frame warranty vs FlexiSpot's 5 years, near-zero wobble vs noticeable wobble at max height, a 355 lb vs 176 lb capacity, and a premium carbonized bamboo surface vs standard laminate. The extra $600 to $700 amortized over 10 years is $60 to $70 per year for a desk used daily. For a light-use setup (2 to 3 hours daily), the FlexiSpot is sufficient." },
  { q: "Do standing desks under $1000 wobble?", a: "All standing desks wobble to some degree at maximum height. Budget single-motor desks at max height have visible wobble under light typing force. Dual-motor desks at mid-range prices have less wobble. Premium desks with dual crossbar frames (UPLIFT V3) have near-zero wobble under normal typing and mouse use. If you stand and type or do precision work, invest in a dual crossbar or reinforced frame design." },
  { q: "What standing desk height is correct for me?", a: "Stand upright and measure from the floor to your bent elbow (arm at 90 degrees, forearm parallel to the floor). That measurement is your target standing desk height. For most adults between 5'6\" and 6'0\", this falls between 42 and 46 inches. For sitting height, sit with feet flat on the floor and measure from the floor to the same bent elbow position. Most adults need 27 to 30 inches seated." },
