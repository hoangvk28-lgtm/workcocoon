export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "More Dimmer Levels Provide Finer Control Than a Single On/Off Brightness Setting",
    "explanation": "The Peakeep Mirror pick's 6 adjustable brightness levels let you fine-tune the display to exactly the right intensity for your specific room lighting and personal sensitivity, rather than being stuck choosing between one bright setting and one dim setting. If you're sensitive to light while sleeping or have a partner with different lighting preferences, more granular dimmer control genuinely helps find a setting that works for everyone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Wide Alarm Volume Range Accommodates Both Heavy and Light Sleepers in the Same Household",
    "explanation": "The Peakeep Mirror pick's 55-100 decibel range spans from a gentle wake-up tone to a loud, insistent alarm, letting you adjust based on how deeply you sleep or whether a partner needs a different volume than you do. A clock with only one or two volume options forces a one-size-fits-all approach that may not actually wake a heavy sleeper or may unnecessarily startle a light sleeper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C Alongside USB-A Reflects How Device Charging Standards Are Actually Shifting",
    "explanation": "The Color Night Light pick's inclusion of both USB-A and USB-C ports acknowledges that many newer phones and accessories now use USB-C exclusively, while older devices or accessories may still require USB-A, so having both port types eliminates the need for a separate adapter regardless of which device you're charging. A clock with only USB-A charging may require an adapter for newer USB-C-only devices, an inconvenience worth checking for before assuming any USB port works universally."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Auto-Dimmer That Responds to Ambient Light Removes a Manual Step From Your Nightly Routine",
    "explanation": "The Peakeep Battery Powered pick's automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light means you don't need to remember to manually dim the display before sleeping or brighten it during the day, a genuine convenience over manual-only dimmer controls that require you to actively adjust settings as lighting conditions change throughout the day."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Key Lock Function Prevents a Genuinely Common Annoyance With Bedside Clocks",
    "explanation": "The Peakeep Battery Powered pick's key lock function specifically prevents accidentally bumping a button while reaching for the clock in the dark, which on unlocked clocks can inadvertently change your alarm time or disable it entirely without you realizing until the next morning. This feature matters most if you place the clock somewhere you'll be reaching for it in low-light conditions, like right beside your pillow."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I charge a laptop using the USB ports on the DreamSky or Color Night Light clocks?", "a": "No, these USB ports are designed for charging smaller devices like phones and tablets at standard USB power levels, not the higher wattage typically required to charge a laptop; use your laptop's dedicated charger for that purpose." },
  { "q": "Does the Peakeep Mirror clock's decorative design compromise its readability compared to a plain digital display?", "a": "No, despite the decorative mirror-face design, the listing specifies a large 6 x 3 inch display with clear, crisp digits, maintaining strong readability alongside the aesthetic upgrade." },
  { "q": "How many colors can I actually display at once on the Color Night Light clock?", "a": "You can choose one number color from 11 options and one ambient base light color from 10 options at any given time, allowing for a combination that suits your preference, though it displays one selected combination rather than cycling through multiple colors simultaneously." },
  { "q": "Is the Peakeep Battery Powered clock's auto-dimmer feature adjustable if I don't like the automatic setting?", "a": "Yes, it offers 4 manual brightness settings (L03-L02-L01-OFF) in addition to the auto-dimmer mode, so you can switch to manual control if you prefer a fixed brightness level rather than automatic adjustment." },
  { "q": "Will the DreamSky clock's alarm volume range of 30-90 decibels be loud enough for a very heavy sleeper?", "a": "90 decibels is comparable to a lawn mower or heavy traffic noise, generally loud enough to wake most heavy sleepers, though individual results vary based on personal sleep depth and room acoustics." },
  { "q": "Do any of these clocks specifically support both 12-hour and 24-hour time display formats?", "a": "The DreamSky pick specifically mentions easy switching between civilian (12-hour) and military (24-hour) time formats; check the specific listings for the other picks to confirm this feature if it's a requirement for your household." }
