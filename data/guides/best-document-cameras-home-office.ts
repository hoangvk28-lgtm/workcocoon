  {
    q: "What is a document camera and how is it different from a webcam?",
    a: "A document camera is an overhead camera on an adjustable arm, optimized to focus at 20 to 40 centimeters for capturing flat documents, books, and objects on your desk. A webcam is optimized for 50 to 100 centimeters for capturing your face. A document camera shows content; a webcam shows you. Many users benefit from having both.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a document camera as a regular webcam for video calls?",
    a: "Yes. Every document camera on this list appears as a USB camera source in Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet. You can position the arm to point at your face for a standard video call. However, a dedicated webcam is better optimized for face capture at typical monitor distance, with auto-framing and face-detection features that document cameras do not include.",
  },
  {
    q: "What resolution do I need for a document camera?",
    a: "For A4 documents with standard printed text, 8MP is sufficient. For small handwriting, fine diagrams, or A3-size pages, 13MP or 4K resolution provides noticeably sharper capture. The INSWAN INS-2 and IPEVO VZ-R Ultra both offer 13MP for users who need fine detail at larger capture areas.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do document cameras work with Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet?",
    a: "Yes. All picks on this list connect via USB and appear as camera sources in any conferencing software. In your video call settings, select the document camera as your video input. You can switch between your webcam and document camera mid-call in most platforms.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does HDMI mode mean on a document camera?",
    a: "HDMI mode lets you connect the camera directly to a projector, monitor, or display using a standard HDMI cable, with no computer in between. This is primarily useful for in-person classroom teaching or meeting rooms where you want to project documents to a screen without routing through a laptop. For home office use via Zoom or Teams, USB mode is sufficient.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a document camera replace a flatbed scanner?",
    a: "For most home office document scanning needs, yes. The INSWAN INS-2 captures A3-size pages and includes OCR software that converts printed text to editable documents at approximately 96 percent accuracy. For high-volume scanning or documents requiring archival-quality resolution, a dedicated scanner is still faster. For occasional digitizing of contracts, notes, and printed pages, a document camera is a practical replacement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which document camera is best for a standing desk or flexible workspace?",
    a: "The INSWAN INS-3 with its detachable handheld design offers the most flexibility. The arm detaches so you can hold the camera at any angle, position it over objects at different heights, or mount it separately from the base. It works well for unconventional desk setups.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a wireless document camera?",
    a: "Only if you move the camera between locations during use. For a fixed home office desk, a USB cable is more reliable and adds no latency. Wireless mode is most useful for classroom teachers who position the camera at student desks or walk around the room during demonstrations. The IPEVO VZ-X is the only wireless option on this list.",
