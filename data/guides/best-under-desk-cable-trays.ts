    q: "What is the best under desk cable tray without drilling?",
    a: "Two main paths: adhesive-only (QiaoYoubang at $18–$25 or Slim Adhesive Drawer at $12–$22) for most wood desks, or clamp-on (Scandinavian Hub at $28–$38 or Stand Up Desk Store at $32–$42) for glass and standing desks. Clamp options are more durable long-term; adhesive is more reversible but can fail on textured surfaces after 6–12 months.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a cable tray with a glass desk?",
    a: "Yes, but only with a clamp-on design. Adhesive will not hold on glass. The Scandinavian Hub Clamp Tray is specifically designed for this and works on desk edges between 0.75 and 2 inches thick. Do not use adhesive or screw-mount trays on glass desktops.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you hide power bricks with a cable tray?",
    a: "Standard trays are 2–3 inches deep and power bricks will stick out. Two solutions: use an extra-deep tray (VIVO Extra Deep at $35–$45 has 4+ inch depth), or route bricks to the side of the tray and let them rest beside it. The BTOD Ultimate Box ($240+) fully encloses any size adapter.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do under desk cable trays work with standing desks?",
    a: "Yes, with planning. Use a clamp-on tray that attaches to the desk frame (not the desktop) so it moves with the desk. Route cables with 18 inches of slack for every 12 inches of height adjustment range. The Stand Up Desk Store Clamp Tray is designed specifically for this use case.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much weight can an under desk cable tray hold?",
    a: "Standard trays hold 15–20 lbs. Heavy-duty options like Humanscale NeatTech and BTOD Ultimate Box hold 30–50 lbs. For reference, a typical power strip weighs 1–2 lbs and a laptop charger brick weighs 0.3–0.5 lbs. Most home office setups stay well under the 15-lb limit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best cable tray for aesthetic appeal?",
    a: "For complete cable invisibility: Humanscale NeatTech ($120–$150) hides cables behind a drop-down door, and BTOD Ultimate Box ($240+) encloses everything in a solid metal shell. For minimalist partial concealment: the Monoprice White Tray ($22–$32) blends with white desks, and the Scandinavian Hub ($28–$38) has a clean powder-coated steel look.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I keep cables from tangling in a tray?",
    a: "Bundle cables by destination using Velcro straps (monitor group, power group, peripheral group). Zip-tie bundles to the tray so they stay put. Label each bundle. Limit each bundle to 4–5 cables maximum. Routing all cables toward the same exit point of the tray prevents cross-tangling.",
  },
