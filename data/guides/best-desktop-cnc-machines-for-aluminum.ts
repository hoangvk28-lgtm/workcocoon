export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC really cut aluminum or just engrave the surface?",
    "a": "It depends entirely on rigidity and spindle torque. Many desktop machines can lightly engrave metal surfaces, but genuine cutting with real depth of cut needs a rigid frame, adequate torque, and appropriate feeds, verify with documented cut evidence rather than a material badge."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the biggest mistake people make cutting metal on a hobby CNC?",
    "a": "Pushing feeds and depth of cut too aggressively for the machine's actual rigidity, which causes chatter, tool breakage, or lost steps. Start conservative and increase gradually based on how the machine and material respond."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
