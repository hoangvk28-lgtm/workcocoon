    "q": "Do I need special drivers to use a drawing tablet on drawing tablets for pc?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Can driver conflicts happen if I own tablets from different brands?",
    "a": "Yes, this is a known issue. Uninstall other brands' tablet drivers before installing a new one, and reboot, to avoid pointer or pressure conflicts between competing driver software."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do more pressure levels always mean a better drawing experience?",
    "a": "Not by itself. Pressure-level count matters less than initial activation force, line stability, and tilt behavior, since a tablet with fewer levels but low activation force and no wobble can feel better than one with a higher spec sheet number."

  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between a standalone tablet and a pen display?",
