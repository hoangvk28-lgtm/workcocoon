    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best walking pads (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best walking pads (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What is the difference between a walking pad and a treadmill?", a: "A walking pad is a compact flat walking belt without a front frame or safety handlebar, designed specifically for under-desk use at 1 to 4 mph. A treadmill includes a handlebar, larger motor, and higher speed range for cardio exercise. Some 2-in-1 walking pads (UREVO Strol 2E Pro) bridge both categories with an attachable handle." },
  { q: "How much does a walking pad cost?", a: "Walking pads range from $89 to $400 in this roundup. Budget options under $150 (Yagud, Vhorilix XM-A1, KASSADIN V300) cover basic desk walking without incline or app features. Mid-range $200 to $300 (UREVO SpaceWalk 5L, TRAILVIBER X01) add auto incline, better motors, and app connectivity. Premium options above $300 (WalkingPad P1, WalkingPad Z1R, CyberPad) add premium materials and design." },
  { q: "How long should you walk on a walking pad each day?", a: "Most desk-walking research suggests 60 to 90 minutes of accumulated walking at 1.5 to 2 mph provides meaningful calorie and circulation benefits. This does not need to be continuous. Many users walk for 20 to 30 minutes, pause for focused tasks requiring fine motor control, then resume, accumulating their daily minutes across multiple sessions." },
  { q: "Do walking pads require maintenance?", a: "Brushless motor walking pads require minimal maintenance: occasional belt lubrication (every 3 to 6 months depending on use) and keeping the belt clean of debris. Brushed motor models additionally require carbon brush replacement every 12 to 18 months of daily use. Both require periodic belt tension checks to prevent belt slipping." },
  { q: "Can a walking pad support 250 lbs?", a: "Several models in this roundup exceed 250 lbs: the Yagud at 440 lbs, TRAILVIBER X01 at 450 lbs, Wildroot V300 at 350 lbs, and UREVO SpaceWalk 5L at 400 lbs. Users near or above 250 lbs should choose models with at least a 300-lb stated capacity to maintain the safety margin needed for dynamic walking load." },
