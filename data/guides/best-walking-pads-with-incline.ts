    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best walking pads with incline (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best walking pads with incline (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best walking pads with incline (2026) over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best walking pads with incline (2026) you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best walking pads with incline (2026) that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "How much does incline actually help with calorie burn?", a: "Research consistently shows that walking at 12% incline at 2 mph burns roughly 60% more calories than walking at 0% incline at the same speed. Even a 4-degree incline adds approximately 25% more calorie burn. For home-office users who cannot increase walking speed without affecting work quality, incline is the most effective way to increase calorie expenditure during desk sessions." },
  { q: "Is auto-incline worth the extra cost?", a: "Auto-incline is worth the premium for users who want incline variation throughout the day without workflow interruption. Manual incline models require stopping, bending down to adjust the frame, and restarting the belt, which disrupts focus. For users who set one incline and keep it throughout a session, the cost difference between auto and manual may not be justified." },
  { q: "What incline grade is safe for desk walking?", a: "Research on incline desk walking suggests that grades up to 10% are sustainable for 30 to 60-minute sessions at 1.5 to 2 mph. Grades above 10% are more effective for calorie burn but more physically demanding, which can reduce typing accuracy and mental focus. Starting at 4 to 6% and increasing gradually over weeks is the recommended approach for first-time incline walkers." },
  { q: "Do incline walking pads work on carpet?", a: "Yes, but carpet affects stability. The incline creates a force component that pushes the pad backward on smooth surfaces, and carpet grip helps counteract this. On hard floors with an incline, a non-slip mat is essential to prevent the pad from sliding. Most incline walking pads include rubber anti-slip feet, but a dedicated mat provides additional security on hard floors." },
  { q: "Can I use an incline walking pad without the incline?", a: "Yes. All incline models in this roundup operate at 0% flat mode as well as their incline grades. Users can start flat during adaptation periods and introduce incline as their fitness and desk-walking comfort increases. The DeerRun and CURSOR FITNESS models work identically to flat walking pads when the incline is set to zero." },
