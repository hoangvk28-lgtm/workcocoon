export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can any desktop cnc machines for pcb mill PCB traces, or does it need special features?",
    "a": "Genuinely fine PCB work benefits from low spindle runout and surface probing specifically, since copper isolation depth is small enough that ordinary machine tolerances can produce broken or incomplete traces."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is PCB milling faster than etching?",
    "a": "It can be for prototyping since it skips chemicals entirely, but it requires more precise machine setup (runout, leveling) than etching does, so the tradeoff is speed for setup precision."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
