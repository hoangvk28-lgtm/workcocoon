  "ASUS spans both ultrabook and gaming laptop categories under one brand name. Thin ZenBook and VivoBook ultrabooks run cool and light, while ROG and TUF gaming laptops push far more heat through a heavier chassis. A cooling pad that suits one line rarely suits the other, so matching the pad to your specific ASUS laptop matters more than picking whatever pad is rated highest overall.",
  "Almost every pad in this guide is a universal-fit multi-fan design rather than an ASUS-exclusive product, so we evaluated each one by its stated size range, weight capacity, and airflow output against typical ZenBook, VivoBook, ROG, and TUF footprints rather than assuming the ASUS name on a listing guarantees a good fit. If you own a TUF gaming laptop specifically, our narrower ASUS TUF cooling pad guide picks up where this one leaves off.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the pad's stated compatible size range against your laptop's real footprint, not its screen size",
    "explanation": "A laptop's advertised screen size, like 13 or 15.6 inches, describes the diagonal measurement of the display panel, not the physical width and depth of the laptop's base that actually sits on top of a cooling pad, and two laptops with the identical screen size can have meaningfully different base dimensions depending on bezel thickness and chassis design.\n\nCooling pad listings state a compatible size range in inches specifically because they're describing what base footprint fits their surface and fan layout, so treating the screen-size number alone as a fit guarantee is a genuine buying mistake, not just an imprecise shortcut.\n\nMeasure your laptop's actual width and depth, or find those dimensions in its own spec sheet, and compare that against the pad's stated range rather than matching screen-size numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that a wider-range pad isn't automatically better for a smaller laptop",
    "explanation": "Cooling pads spread their fans across the surface in a fixed layout designed around the middle of their stated compatible range, so a pad rated for 12 to 17 inches has its fans positioned to reach a wide variety of vent locations across that whole span, while a laptop toward the small end of that range may not sit directly over as many of those fans as it would on a pad sized more tightly around its own dimensions.\n\nThis matters because the cooling benefit of a pad comes specifically from airflow reaching the laptop's actual intake vents, not from the pad's overall surface area, so a smaller laptop on an oversized pad can genuinely get less effective cooling than the same laptop on a proportionally sized pad, despite technically fitting within the stated range.\n\nWhen your laptop sits toward one end of a pad's stated range rather than the middle, check user photos or reviews specifically describing that size laptop's fit before assuming the airflow lines up well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your laptop's actual vent location and design, especially for thin ultrabooks and MacBooks",
    "explanation": "Most cooling pads are designed around bottom-vented laptops, where intake vents sit on the underside of the chassis directly facing the pad's fans, but some laptops, most notably many MacBook models, use a fully sealed or fanless internal design where the chassis itself acts as a heat sink rather than relying on active airflow from underneath.\n\nThis is a genuine compatibility gap that a cooling pad's stated inch-range compatibility says nothing about, since a pad can physically fit a MacBook's exact footprint while providing essentially no cooling benefit if that specific model has no bottom vents for the fans to blow into.\n\nCheck your specific laptop model's actual cooling design (vented bottom panel versus sealed unibody) before assuming a cooling pad will meaningfully lower its temperature, and treat this as a separate question from simple physical size fit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh fan count and noise level together, not fan count alone",
    "explanation": "A pad's fan count, commonly ranging from a single central fan up to five or six smaller fans, is often marketed as a straightforward better-is-more spec, but more fans spinning simultaneously generally means more total noise output, and a pad with independently controllable fan zones lets you balance airflow against noise rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.\n\nThis is a real everyday tradeoff for anyone using a laptop in a quiet room or on a video call, since a cooling pad running at full multi-fan speed can become audible enough to be distracting, undermining the benefit if you end up turning it off to avoid the noise.\n\nCheck whether the listing states selectable fan modes or independently controlled fan zones, not just the total fan count, if noise control matters to your specific environment."

    "criterion": "Confirm the power source and port type match your laptop before assuming plug-and-play compatibility",
    "explanation": "Nearly all cooling pads draw power over a USB cable rather than a separate power adapter, which keeps setup simple, but the cable end that plugs into your laptop is typically USB-A, and a laptop with only USB-C ports (common on newer ultrabooks and MacBooks) will need a separate USB-C adapter or hub to actually power the pad, an extra cost and cable that isn't obvious from the listing photos alone.\n\nThis matters because a cooling pad that can't be powered defeats its entire purpose regardless of how well it otherwise fits your laptop's size and vent layout, so it's a genuine prerequisite to check, not an afterthought.\n\nCheck the listing's stated cable connector type and confirm it matches an available port on your specific laptop, or budget for an adapter if it doesn't."

  { q: "Does one cooling pad fit all ASUS laptops?", a: "No. ZenBook, VivoBook, ROG, and TUF laptops vary significantly in size and weight, and most cooling pads are universal-fit rather than ASUS-exclusive. Check the pad's stated size range and weight rating against your specific model before buying." },
  { q: "Do ROG and TUF gaming laptops need a different pad than a ZenBook?", a: "Generally yes. Gaming laptops run hotter under sustained load and weigh more, so they benefit more from a pad rated for 15.6 inches and up with a stated temperature drop figure, while a lighter ZenBook can use a smaller, quieter pad." },
  { q: "How much cooler will a pad actually make my ASUS laptop run?", a: "This depends on how well the pad's airflow lines up with your laptop's real vents. Manufacturer-stated temperature drops are a helpful reference point, but based on product specs alone they should be treated as best-case figures rather than guarantees." },
  { q: "Is a cooling pad necessary for a TUF gaming laptop specifically?", a: "It depends on your workload. Light or moderate use rarely needs one, but extended gaming or creative sessions can benefit from added airflow. Our dedicated ASUS TUF cooling pad guide covers this sub-line in more depth." },
  { q: "Will a cooling pad void my ASUS warranty?", a: "External cooling pads that simply sit under the laptop do not open or modify the device, so they do not typically affect an ASUS warranty. Always check your specific warranty terms if you are uncertain." },
  { q: "What is more important, fan count or fan size?", a: "Neither wins outright. A single large fan concentrates airflow on one spot, which suits a laptop with one hot zone, while multiple smaller fans spread weaker airflow more broadly, which suits a laptop that runs warm across a larger surface." },
