export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Battery Backup on an AC-Powered Clock Only Preserves Settings, Not Full Display Function",
    "explanation": "The Amazon Basics pick's battery backup keeps your alarm and time settings stored in memory for up to 8 hours during a power outage, but this doesn't mean the display stays lit or fully functional without AC power, it simply prevents you from having to reset everything once power returns. Don't confuse this settings-retention backup with the fully battery-operated design of picks like the Sharp or Betus clocks, which can display time continuously on battery power alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Foldable Design Genuinely Changes How Practical a Clock Is for Travel",
    "explanation": "The Betus pick's foldable, collapsible stand lets it pack nearly flat into a suitcase or bag pocket, a real practical advantage over a clock with a fixed, non-folding base that takes up more three-dimensional space when packed. If you travel with any regularity and want a dedicated travel clock rather than relying on your phone, this foldable design detail matters more than it might initially seem."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "On-Demand Backlights Extend Battery Life at the Cost of Convenience",
    "explanation": "The Sharp pick's backlight only illuminates for 5 seconds after pressing a button, specifically designed to conserve battery life on a fully battery-operated clock, rather than staying continuously lit like an AC-powered display. This is a reasonable tradeoff for extending how long your batteries last, but it does mean you can't simply glance at the clock in a dark room without first pressing a button to activate the light."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Adhesive Mounting Opens Up Placement Options a Standing Clock Can't Access",
    "explanation": "The Shudyear pick's included adhesive sticker lets you mount the clock on a wall, dashboard, or vertical surface where a standard standing clock with a base simply wouldn't work, genuinely expanding where you can use it beyond a flat desk or shelf surface. If you have a specific unconventional mounting location in mind, like a car dashboard or a narrow vertical space, this adhesive option is worth prioritizing over a standard freestanding design."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Simple Feature Set at This Price Isn't a Limitation, It's the Point",
    "explanation": "None of the picks in this comparison include advanced features like atomic time syncing, weather forecasting, or USB charging, since those genuinely require more sophisticated electronics that push a clock's price meaningfully higher. At under $15, prioritize picks that execute the basics, accurate timekeeping, a readable display, and reliable alarm function, cleanly rather than expecting feature-rich functionality this price range simply isn't designed to deliver."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the Amazon Basics clock's display go completely dark if the power goes out?", "a": "Yes, without AC power the display itself won't stay illuminated; the battery backup only preserves your stored time and alarm settings for up to 8 hours so you don't need to reset everything once power returns." },
  { "q": "Can the Betus travel clock's temperature reading be used as an accurate room thermometer?", "a": "It provides a general temperature reading suitable for quick reference, though for precise temperature monitoring, a dedicated thermometer would provide more reliable accuracy than a compact travel clock's built-in sensor." },
  { "q": "How long do batteries typically last in the fully battery-operated picks like the Sharp or Shudyear clocks?", "a": "Battery life varies based on usage and specific battery brand, but basic digital clocks with minimal backlight use, like these picks, typically last several months to over a year on standard AAA or coin-cell batteries before needing replacement." },
  { "q": "Is the Shudyear mini clock's display actually readable from a normal desk viewing distance?", "a": "The listing describes an extra-large display relative to its small 1.4 x 2.4 inch size, suitable for close-range viewing like a desk or dashboard, though it's not designed for reading from across a room the way a larger clock would be." },
  { "q": "Does the Sharp clock's soft-touch case require any special cleaning care?", "a": "A soft-touch rubberized finish generally just needs a damp cloth for regular cleaning, similar to standard plastic, though avoiding harsh chemical cleaners helps preserve the tactile finish over time." },
  { "q": "Can I use any of these clocks without ever needing to buy batteries if I keep them plugged in?", "a": "Only the Amazon Basics pick can technically function purely on AC power without batteries installed, though you'd lose the settings-backup protection during outages; the other three picks in this comparison require batteries for any operation at all." }
