      "The VASAGLE CUSTOS Snow White has the largest review base on this list by a wide margin. With over 3,200 ratings at 4.0 stars and the most affordable entry price at $62.99, this is the default recommendation for most buyers. Clean white finish works in most home office styles. For a small desk setup, it fits neatly beside or under a desk without dominating the space. At this sales volume, any systematic quality problem would generate a visible pattern of negative reviews - the fact that 4.0 stars holds across 3,200+ purchases means the quality is consistent and well-documented.",

    q: "How hard are these 2-drawer file cabinets to assemble?",

They provide a warmer aesthetic that matches wood desks better but are heavier per cubic inch and sensitive to moisture. Metal cabinets like the DEVAISE Metal White are lighter, more moisture-resistant, and typically arrive assembled.
