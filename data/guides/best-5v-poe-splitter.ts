export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Micro USB and USB-A Connectors Are Not Interchangeable, So Matching the Exact Port Type Matters",
    "explanation": "Three picks in this comparison use a Micro USB connector while the fourth specifically uses a USB-A female port, two genuinely different physical connector types that determine which devices a splitter can actually power, since a Fire TV Stick's USB-A power plug won't fit a Micro USB splitter's output regardless of matching voltage and amperage. This matters significantly since buying the wrong connector type means the splitter simply won't physically connect to your device. Verify your specific device's exact charging port type (Micro USB versus USB-A) before purchasing a 5V splitter, rather than assuming any 5V splitter works with any 5V device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Gigabit Speed Provides Real Benefit Specifically for Newer, Network-Intensive Devices Like a Raspberry Pi 4",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit Micro USB pick specifically supports full 1000Mbps data alongside its 5V/3A power output, a genuine benefit for a Raspberry Pi 4 or similar board running network-intensive applications that can exceed the 100Mbps ceiling of the standard splitters in this comparison. This matters if your specific device and use case can actually utilize bandwidth beyond 100Mbps, and matters much less for a basic Raspberry Pi 2/3 or simple streaming device that doesn't need that extra throughput. Check whether your specific device and application genuinely benefit from Gigabit speed before paying the modest premium over a standard 100Mbps splitter."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Splitter's USB Port May Be Power-Only and Not Support Actual Data Transfer Through That Connection",
    "explanation": "The USB-A pick specifically clarifies it's not suitable for devices requiring USB data transfer like a mouse or keyboard, since its USB-A port delivers only power, not the USB data protocol those peripherals need to function. This matters if you were considering using a PoE splitter's USB output to also transmit data to a peripheral device, which won't work regardless of the splitter's power specifications, and matters less if you only need power delivery to your device (the actual network data still flows via a separate Ethernet connection on the device itself). Confirm whether your specific use case only requires power delivery through the USB port, since these splitters' USB connections are typically power-only, not data-capable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Documented Range Beyond the Standard 100m Limit Can Be a Genuine Differentiator for Longer Cable Runs",
    "explanation": "The UCTRONICS Micro USB pick specifically states a range up to 492ft (150m), meaningfully longer than the standard 328ft (100m) limit most PoE splitters document, giving real flexibility for a device positioned farther from the PoE source than typical. This matters if your specific installation requires reaching a device beyond the standard 100m cable limit, and matters less if your device sits comfortably within that standard range. Check a splitter's specifically documented maximum range if your installation distance is close to or exceeds the standard 100m PoE limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Pack Pricing Delivers Real Per-Unit Savings Only When You Actually Need That Many Splitters",
    "explanation": "The ANVISION 4-pack works out to roughly $7.25 per unit, a meaningfully lower cost per splitter than buying four single-unit UCTRONICS or Gigabit picks separately, but only delivers real value if you genuinely need to convert four separate devices at once. This matters if you're deploying multiple Raspberry Pi units, cameras, or similar devices simultaneously, where the per-unit savings add up, and matters less if you only need one splitter, where the single-unit picks avoid paying for three splitters you won't use. Calculate the actual number of devices you need to convert before choosing between a multi-pack and single-unit purchase."
