export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "802.3bt Compliance Is the Only Standard That Actually Guarantees True 90W Delivery",
    "explanation": "The 802.3bt standard (sometimes called PoE++, UPoE+, or Type 4) was specifically designed to support power levels beyond the older 802.3at standard's 30W ceiling, using all four pairs of wires in the Ethernet cable rather than just two, and a listing that claims 90W without explicitly citing 802.3bt compliance may not actually deliver on that claim reliably. This matters significantly for high-draw devices like PTZ cameras with heaters or digital signage that genuinely need close to the full 90W, since an underpowered unit will cause intermittent failures rather than a clean shutdown. Check the listing specifically for the 802.3bt standard name, not just the wattage number, before trusting a 90W claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Gigabit Port Speed at the 90W Tier Only Matters if Your Network Backbone Actually Supports It",
    "explanation": "A 10Gbps-capable injector like the Omada pick can theoretically move far more data than a Gigabit-capped injector, but that capability is entirely wasted if the switch and cabling on either side of it only support Gigabit speeds, meaning you'd pay a real price premium for throughput you can never use. This matters if you're already running or planning a genuine 10Gbps network backbone for high-bandwidth applications like multi-camera 4K surveillance feeds, and matters much less for a standard Gigabit office or home network. Confirm your actual network infrastructure's real maximum speed before paying extra for multi-gigabit injector capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Documented Surge and ESD Protection Ratings Matter More at Higher Power Levels Where Failure Costs More",
    "explanation": "A 90W injector powering an expensive PTZ camera or industrial IoT gateway represents a higher-value connected device than a basic 15.4W camera, meaning an electrical fault that damages the connected equipment carries a real cost, and listings that state specific surge protection numbers (like 4kV) and ESD protection numbers (like 6kV or 8kV) give you a concrete way to compare protection levels rather than trusting a vague overvoltage protection claim. This matters more for permanent installations in less electrically stable environments, and matters less in a clean, modern indoor electrical setup. Compare the specific stated kV numbers between listings when your installation or connected equipment justifies the extra scrutiny."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA Compliance at the 90W Tier Follows the Same Institutional Logic as Lower Wattage Tiers",
    "explanation": "Just as with lower-wattage injectors, NDAA and TAA compliance at the 90W tier restricts sourcing to approved manufacturers for U.S. government and government-adjacent procurement, and this requirement doesn't change based on the injector's power rating. This matters if you're deploying 90W injectors for a school district, municipal, or government-contractor network where procurement policy specifically requires it, and matters not at all for a private business or home network. Check your organization's specific procurement policy rather than assuming compliance requirements scale with power tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Backward Compatibility Range Determines Whether One 90W Injector Can Serve a Mixed-Device Environment",
    "explanation": "Some 90W injectors explicitly state backward compatibility down through 802.3bt's own 60W tier, 802.3at's 30W, and 802.3af's 15.4W, meaning the same physical unit correctly auto-detects and powers a wide range of devices with different power needs, while others may only clearly document compatibility with the newest standard. This matters if you're deploying injectors across a facility with a mix of older 15.4W cameras and newer 90W PTZ units and want to standardize on fewer SKUs, and matters less if every device in your deployment has an identical, known power requirement. Check the listing's stated backward compatibility range specifically if standardizing on one injector model across mixed equipment is a priority."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What devices actually need a 90W PoE++ injector?", "a": "PTZ cameras with built-in heaters, large digital signage displays, industrial IoT gateways, and some multi-radio access points typically draw enough power to require the full 90W 802.3bt tier rather than the lower 30W or 15.4W standards." },
  { "q": "Do I need a 10Gbps injector if my devices only need 90W of power?", "a": "No, power delivery and data speed are separate specs; a Gigabit-capped 90W injector delivers the full 90W just as reliably as a 10Gbps one, and the extra speed only matters if your network backbone actually supports 10Gbps traffic." },
  { "q": "Is a 90W injector backward compatible with my existing 30W devices?", "a": "Most 90W 802.3bt injectors, including several in this comparison, explicitly state backward compatibility with 802.3at (30W) and 802.3af (15.4W) devices via auto-sensing technology." },
  { "q": "Why is the Omada 10G injector so much more expensive than the others?", "a": "Its multi-gigabit port speed up to 10Gbps requires more sophisticated internal components than a Gigabit-capped injector, which accounts for the price premium over the other 90W picks in this comparison." },
  { "q": "What's the maximum cable distance for a 90W PoE++ injector?", "a": "Like other PoE standards, 802.3bt injectors are rated for up to 100 meters (328 feet) over standard Ethernet cable, the same distance limit as lower-power PoE standards." },
  { "q": "Does NDAA compliance affect a 90W injector's actual performance?", "a": "No, NDAA compliance is a sourcing and procurement restriction unrelated to the injector's electrical performance; a compliant and non-compliant unit can deliver identical power and speed specs." }
