export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 2-Port Injector Saves Real Space and Cost Compared to Two Separate Single-Port Units When Devices Are Near Each Other",
    "explanation": "A purpose-built 2-port injector occupies roughly the footprint of one unit while powering two devices, avoiding the extra cost and installation space of buying and mounting two separate single-port injectors when your two devices are physically near each other. This matters significantly if you're installing two cameras or access points at the same general location, and matters less if your two devices are spread across a property, where separate single-port injectors near each device might actually be more practical. Count your actual device locations relative to each other before assuming a 2-port unit is automatically the more efficient choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Documented ESD Protection Ratings Provide Real, Comparable Assurance Beyond a Generic Overvoltage Claim",
    "explanation": "A listing that states a specific ESD protection level, like 15kV air and 8kV contact, gives you an objective, checkable number to compare against another listing's protection claims, while a generic statement about overvoltage protection with no specific rating doesn't let you meaningfully compare protection quality between products. This matters more for a business installation protecting enterprise-grade equipment, and matters less for a low-stakes home installation where any basic protection is likely sufficient. Compare specific stated kV numbers between listings when the cost of your connected equipment justifies the extra scrutiny."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DC Cabinet Input Support Removes the Need for a Separate AC Power Run in an Industrial or Cabinet Installation",
    "explanation": "A 2-port injector designed to accept a 12-48V DC input, like the Centopto pick, lets you power two devices directly from an existing DC cabinet supply without adding a separate AC circuit just for the injector, a genuinely different design purpose from the AC-only picks in this comparison. This matters significantly for a retrofit installation into an existing industrial cabinet with DC power already present, and matters not at all for a standard home or office installation with readily available AC outlets. Check your actual installation environment's available power type before assuming any 2-port injector accepts your specific power source."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Gigabit Versus 10/100Mbps Speed Still Matters at the 2-Port Tier for the Same Reasons It Does Elsewhere",
    "explanation": "Just as with single-port injectors, a 2-port unit can be limited to 100Mbps or support full Gigabit speeds, and this distinction is entirely separate from the power delivery specs, mattering significantly for higher-resolution cameras or bandwidth-intensive access points while being largely irrelevant for basic VoIP phones or standard-definition cameras. This matters for correctly matching your two connected devices' actual bandwidth needs to the injector's stated speed rather than assuming all 2-port injectors share the same data rate. Check the specific stated port speed on a 2-port listing rather than assuming Gigabit is standard across this entire category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Parallel Slide-In Design Simplifies Installing Multiple Units Together More Than a Standalone Form Factor Does",
    "explanation": "If you're installing several 2-port injectors in the same location, like a shared equipment closet serving multiple pairs of cameras across a building, a design specifically built to slide and connect together side by side, as the PLUSPOE pick states, keeps the installation organized compared to units designed only for standalone individual mounting. This matters significantly for a larger deployment with multiple 2-port units in one shared space, and matters not at all for a single unit powering just one pair of devices. Consider a multi-unit-friendly design specifically when you're deploying more than one 2-port injector in the same physical location."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a 2-port PoE injector better than two separate single-port injectors?", "a": "When your two devices are physically near each other, yes, since it saves installation space and often costs less than buying two separate single-port units; for devices spread far apart, separate injectors may be more practical." },
  { "q": "What's the real benefit of a higher ESD protection rating like 15kV?", "a": "It provides documented, independently comparable protection against electrostatic discharge events, more meaningful for a business installation protecting expensive enterprise equipment than a low-stakes home setup." },
  { "q": "Can I power a 2-port PoE injector from a solar or battery system?", "a": "Only if the specific unit is designed for DC input, like the Centopto pick in this comparison; standard AC-powered 2-port injectors cannot accept solar or battery power directly." },
  { "q": "Do both ports on a 2-port injector share the same total power budget?", "a": "Yes, typically the total wattage stated is shared across both ports, so check the total budget against your two devices' combined power draw, not just the per-port maximum in isolation." },
  { "q": "Is Gigabit speed necessary for a 2-port injector powering basic security cameras?", "a": "For standard-definition cameras, 10/100Mbps is often sufficient, but for higher-resolution or 4K cameras, Gigabit speed avoids a real throughput bottleneck." },
  { "q": "Can I mount multiple 2-port PoE injectors together in the same equipment closet?", "a": "Yes, though a design specifically built for that, like a parallel slide-in mounting feature, makes a multi-unit deployment more organized than units designed only for standalone use." }
