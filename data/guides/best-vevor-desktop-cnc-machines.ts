Aluminum alloy construction with surface oxidation treatment keeps weight down while resisting deformation.\n\nOver 70% of parts arrive pre-assembled, needing only the offline controller, gantry frame, and base combined before plugging in. It's rated for bamboo, wood, leather, plastic, foam, and vinyl, though the listing explicitly notes that CNC programming knowledge and separate programming software are required, this is not a full out-of-box solution.",

export const faq = [

    "q": "Are all vevor desktop cnc machines products currently sold, or does the lineup include discontinued models?",
    "a": "Check current first-party store pages directly, since older models often stay heavily indexed in search results long after being discontinued or moved to support-only status."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does buying a well-known brand guarantee better build quality?",
    "a": "Not automatically. Brand lineups often span multiple hardware generations and price tiers, so verify the exact model's specs rather than assuming brand reputation alone predicts quality."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
