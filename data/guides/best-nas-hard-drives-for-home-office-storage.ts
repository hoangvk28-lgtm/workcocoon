export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

  {
    q: "What's the difference between a NAS hard drive, a NAS enclosure, and a NAS bundle?",
    a: "A NAS hard drive is a bare internal drive, like the WD Red Plus, that only works once installed in a compatible enclosure you already own. A NAS enclosure like the UGREEN DXP2800 or Synology DS925+ is diskless, it ships with zero drives, and you buy compatible NAS-rated drives separately. A bundle like the BUFFALO LinkStation 210 includes a drive already installed, so it works immediately with no separate drive purchase.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SMR or CMR better for a NAS hard drive?",
    a: "CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording) is the safer choice for any drive going into a RAID array, since it writes to dedicated tracks and stays stable during a rebuild. SMR drives overlap tracks to pack in more capacity per dollar, but that overlap slows the drive dramatically during a RAID rebuild and can contribute to array failure. The WD Red Plus in this list is CMR, which is worth confirming for any drive before it goes into a multi-bay array.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much workload can a typical home office NAS handle?",
    a: "Standard NAS drives carry roughly a 180TB/year workload rating, and a typical home office NAS running daily backups for 1-2 people uses well under that figure. Pro-tier NAS drives push closer to 300TB/year but are usually overkill unless you're running constant heavy read/write, like hosting databases or virtual machines around the clock.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a 2-bay or 4-bay NAS enclosure for a home office?",
    a: "A 2-bay enclosure like the UGREEN DXP2800 or Synology DS225+ supports RAID 1 mirroring, which is enough redundancy for most home offices. A 4-bay enclosure like the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus or Synology DS925+ supports RAID 5 or RAID 10, giving more headroom for both capacity and redundancy as storage needs grow, at a higher total cost once drives are factored in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy an HDD, SSD, or NVMe cache for my NAS?",
    a: "HDDs remain the most cost-effective option for large-capacity, non-speed-critical storage like backups and photo archives. SSDs make more sense for VM hosting or database workloads, or anywhere drive noise and vibration matter. Many home office setups pair HDD main storage with an NVMe cache drive, where supported, to get most of the speed benefit without paying full SSD prices for total capacity.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does vibration matter in a 4-bay NAS but not as much in a single drive?",
    a: "Once you're running 3 or 4 spinning drives together in one enclosure, sympathetic vibration between drives can cause read errors on drives that aren't built to compensate for it. NAS-grade drives include vibration compensation firmware specifically for this, while ordinary desktop drives do not, which is one more reason to avoid repurposing a spare desktop drive in a multi-bay NAS.",
