    question: "Is a charging station worth it for a desk?",
    answer: "Yes, if you charge more than two devices daily at your desk. A charging station replaces multiple adapters and cables with one hub and one wall plug. The desk becomes cleaner, and you stop hunting for the right cable at low battery moments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a desk charging station charge a laptop?",
    answer: "Some can, some can't. For laptop charging, look specifically for a USB-C port with Power Delivery (PD) and at least 65W output on that port -- 100W+ for 15/16-inch pro laptops. The Anker Prime 200W, UGREEN Nexode 200W, and Baseus Nomos all support laptop charging. The Anker budget hub and BESTEK organizer do not.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a charging station and a docking station?",
    answer: "A charging station charges device batteries. A docking station connects peripherals -- monitors, Ethernet, USB devices -- and also charges. For desk setups with external monitors, a docking station handles both connection and power.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many devices can a desk charging station handle?",
    answer: "The picks in this guide range from 5 devices (budget hub) to 8 devices (BESTEK). Real-world performance depends on total wattage: a 65W station charging a laptop leaves little power for other devices. A 200W station handles a laptop plus 4--5 other devices comfortably.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a GaN charger and why does it matter for desks?",
    answer: "GaN (Gallium Nitride) is a semiconductor material that allows chargers to be smaller, more efficient, and cooler-running than traditional silicon chargers. For desks, this means more power output in a smaller footprint, no fan noise, and less heat on your desk surface. All of the top picks in this guide (except the BESTEK and budget Anker options) use GaN technology.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need fast charging for a desk charging station?",
    answer: "If you top up devices during short breaks -- 20-minute meetings, lunch -- fast charging (USB-C PD or Qi2 wireless) makes a real difference. If devices charge overnight or over several hours unattended, standard charging is fine. For desk use where time matters, prioritize USB-C PD and Qi2 wireless where possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "What charging station has the smallest desk footprint?",
    answer: "The Anker Nano 6-in-1 has the smallest footprint in this roundup at 3.9 x 3.7 inches (9.9 x 9.4 cm). For even smaller footprints, see our guide to the best small desk charging stations.",
