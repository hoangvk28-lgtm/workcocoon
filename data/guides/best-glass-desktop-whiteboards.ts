  "Glass has one clear, verifiable advantage over melamine dry erase surfaces: it resists ghosting (the faint marker residue that builds up on cheaper surfaces after repeated use) far longer, which is why every pick in this guide is a genuinely glass surface confirmed by its own listing title, not a generic \"dry erase board\" assumed to be glass.",
  "That durability comes with real tradeoffs worth weighing before buying: glass is heavier and more fragile than melamine, its polished surface can produce more glare under overhead lighting or on video calls, and edge finish (polished versus raw-cut) affects how safe it is to handle during setup, none of which shows up in a simple size-and-price comparison.",
