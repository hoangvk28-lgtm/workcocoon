  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best office chair often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best office chair holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best office chair over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best office chair you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best office chair that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What's the real floor space an office chair takes up in a small room?", a: "It's set by the base diameter, not the seat width. Seat width usually runs 18 to 20 inches, but the 5-star swivel base underneath typically spans 24 to 28 inches, and that's the dimension that determines whether the chair actually fits and can swivel freely in your space." },
  { q: "Is an armless chair a good idea for a small desk?", a: "It trims several inches of width and helps the chair tuck fully under a desk, but removes shoulder and forearm support. It's a reasonable trade-off for sessions under about two hours. For longer daily use, the strain from missing arm support tends to outweigh the space savings." },
  { q: "Why won't my chair's armrests fit under my desk?", a: "Fixed armrests can be as high as the desk's apron clearance, some desks as low as 24 inches from the floor to the underside. If your desk sits low, look for chairs with flip-up or removable arms so you can tuck the chair fully underneath when not in use." },
  { q: "How much room does a reclining chair need behind it?", a: "A 20 to 30 degree recline can add 10 to 15 inches of depth behind the chair. Measure the distance from your chair's upright position to the nearest wall before assuming you'll have room to recline without hitting it." },
  { q: "Do cheaper compact chairs wear out faster?", a: "Generally yes. Sub-$150 compact mesh chairs commonly show wear within 2 to 3 years of regular use, while more reinforced frames at a similar footprint tend to last considerably longer. If you're keeping the chair for years, factor that into the price comparison." },
