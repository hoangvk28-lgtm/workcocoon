export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Apple's Display Output Limits Vary Genuinely by Exact Chip Tier, Not Just by Mac Model Name",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY pick specifically documents that M1/M2/M3/M4 Max chips support triple extended displays, M4/M5 base or Pro chips support dual displays, and M1/M2/M3 base chips support only a single display, a granular breakdown that reveals how much display capability varies within Apple's own current chip lineup regardless of which MacBook Pro model you technically own. This matters significantly if you're choosing a dock specifically to maximize your exact Mac chip's display potential, and matters less if a single external display is sufficient for your needs. Check your Mac's specific chip tier (base, Pro, or Max) against a dock's per-chip display documentation rather than assuming a generic 'MacBook Pro compatible' claim applies equally across every chip tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Some Mac-Exclusive Docks Are Genuinely Locked to a Single Mac and Cannot Be Shared or Switched",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY FusionDock Max 2's listing specifically states it is restricted to only one Mac and does not support switching between other Macs, a real limitation distinct from simply being 'Mac compatible,' meaning if you own multiple Macs or plan to use the dock with a future Mac purchase, this specific dock won't accommodate that. This matters if you regularly switch between multiple Mac devices or share a dock among household or office Macs, where this restriction would be a genuine dealbreaker, and matters less if you have exactly one Mac that will always use this dock. Check whether a Mac-exclusive dock is specifically restricted to a single paired device before assuming any Mac-compatible dock can be freely used across multiple Macs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-in NVMe Storage Slot's Physical Size Limits Can Exclude Popular SSD Models by Name",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN Maxidok's built-in M.2 slot specifically excludes SSDs with a heatsink wider than 24mm, explicitly naming the Seagate FireCuda 530 with Heatsink, Samsung 9100 PRO with Heatsink, and WD_BLACK SN850X Premium Model as incompatible despite their popularity, a real physical constraint that could derail your storage plans if you already own one of these specific drives. This matters directly if you already own or were planning to buy one of these specifically named incompatible SSD models, and matters less if you're purchasing a new, appropriately sized SSD specifically for this dock. Check a dock's specific SSD size and heatsink width limits, including any explicitly named incompatible models, before assuming any M.2 NVMe SSD will physically fit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Concrete Real-World Transfer Time Benchmark Is Easier to Evaluate Than a Raw Bandwidth Figure Alone",
    "explanation": "The Anker Prime pick's listing specifically states a 150GB file transfers in just 25 seconds through its Thunderbolt 5 port, a concrete, relatable real-world benchmark that's easier to evaluate practically than comparing raw Gbps figures across different docks, which requires more technical interpretation to understand actual impact. This matters if you want an intuitive sense of real-world performance for your specific large-file workflows, and matters less if you're comfortable comparing technical bandwidth specifications directly. Look for a dock listing that provides a concrete real-world transfer time example alongside its raw bandwidth figures, since this gives a more intuitive sense of actual performance for typical large-file tasks."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Genuinely Fanless Cooling Trades Some Sustained Power Ceiling for Completely Silent Operation",
    "explanation": "The iVANKY pick's aerospace-grade thermal design specifically eliminates any internal cooling fan, disclosed to keep the hottest outer-frame point at 49C (120F) during a 12-hour full-load test, well below the 60C (140F) UL touch-temperature safety limit, achieving genuinely silent operation that fan-cooled docks like the CalDigit TS5 Plus cannot match. This matters if you work in a genuinely quiet environment where any fan noise is noticeable and distracting, and matters less if ambient office or home noise already masks typical dock fan sounds. Consider whether completely silent operation is worth potentially trading some maximum sustained power delivery ceiling compared to actively cooled competitors with higher rated wattage across more ports."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the iVANKY FusionDock Max 2 work if I also use a Windows laptop sometimes?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states this dock is not compatible with any Windows or Chrome laptop and is restricted to Mac use only, so if you need cross-platform compatibility, the Anker Prime TB5 or CalDigit TS5 Plus would be better choices." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Thunderbolt 5 dock for MacBook Pro?", "a": "Assuming their MacBook Pro's dual-display or triple-display support is determined solely by the dock's rating, without checking their exact Mac chip tier (base, Pro, or Max), which independently caps the maximum number of external displays regardless of the dock's own capability." },
  { "q": "Is the CalDigit TS5 Plus worth the extra cost over the iVANKY FusionDock Max 2 if I only use one Mac?", "a": "If you exclusively use one Mac and value genuinely silent fanless operation, the iVANKY's detailed per-chip display documentation and quiet design may better suit your needs, but if you want the highest port count with 10GbE networking and Windows compatibility, the CalDigit TS5 Plus's higher price is justified." },
  { "q": "Can I install any M.2 NVMe SSD into the UGREEN Maxidok's storage slot?", "a": "Not any SSD; the listing specifically excludes SSDs with a heatsink wider than 24mm, explicitly naming the Seagate FireCuda 530, Samsung 9100 PRO, and certain WD_BLACK and Lexar models as incompatible, so checking your specific SSD's heatsink dimensions is essential before purchase." },
  { "q": "How do I connect an HDMI monitor to the UGREEN Maxidok since its DP port doesn't support DP++?", "a": "The listing specifically states you'll need an active DP-to-HDMI adapter or cable, since passive adapters and cables will not work with this dock's DisplayPort output for HDMI monitor connections." },
  { "q": "Do these Thunderbolt 5 docks require the latest macOS version to work properly?", "a": "Checking each specific listing's minimum macOS version requirement is worth doing before purchase, since Thunderbolt 5 support and specific display or bandwidth features often require a recent macOS version to function as advertised." }
