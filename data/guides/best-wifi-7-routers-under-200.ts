  "Under $200, tri-band WiFi 7 becomes available for the first time in this budget-tier series, adding a dedicated 6GHz band that avoids the crowded 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrum most neighboring routers compete on, alongside genuine multi-unit mesh systems that expand coverage without needing separate extenders.",
  "We compared this lineup on tri-band versus dual-band coverage, whether a single router or a multi-unit mesh kit better fits your home, and real wired port configurations, since at this price the honest question is which specific combination of speed, coverage, and expandability matches your actual living space."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 6GHz Band Matters Most in Crowded Wireless Environments",
    "explanation": "The 6GHz band used by tri-band routers like the TP-Link Archer BE550 is much less commonly used by neighboring WiFi networks and other wireless devices than the older 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, meaning it experiences less interference and congestion. If you live in a single-family home with few nearby networks, this benefit is less pronounced, but in an apartment building or dense neighborhood where dozens of networks compete on the same channels, a 6GHz-capable router can deliver more consistent real-world speeds even if the dual-band alternative's peak theoretical speed looks similar on paper."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Mesh System's Total Coverage Depends on Proper Unit Placement, Not Just the Spec Sheet",
    "explanation": "A mesh system's stated coverage figure, like the Deco 7's 4,600 sq. ft. claim, assumes each unit is placed in a location that maintains a strong connection back to the main router, not clustered together or placed too far apart. Placing mesh units incorrectly, like putting both units in the same room, wastes the system's actual coverage potential regardless of its stated specifications, so plan realistic placement throughout your home's actual layout before assuming you'll achieve the full advertised coverage area."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wired Backhaul Between Mesh Units Delivers More Consistent Speed Than Wireless-Only Backhaul",
    "explanation": "Backhaul refers to the connection method mesh units use to communicate with each other and the main router, and a mesh system supporting simultaneous wired and wireless backhaul, like the Deco 7 pick using both WiFi 7 and 2.5G Ethernet, can maintain more stable speeds throughout your home compared to relying purely on wireless communication between units. If your home already has Ethernet wiring available near where you'd place a second mesh unit, using a wired backhaul connection generally delivers noticeably more consistent performance than wireless-only mesh setups."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dedicated Gaming Traffic Prioritization Only Helps the Specific Device It's Assigned To",
    "explanation": "A feature like the ASUS TUF Gaming BE6500's dedicated Gaming Port prioritizes network traffic for whichever single device is physically plugged into that specific port, meaning it doesn't automatically improve gaming performance for a device connected wirelessly or through a different port. If multiple people in your household game simultaneously on different devices, a single dedicated gaming port only benefits the one device using it, so consider whether your actual gaming setup matches how this feature is designed to work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Private IoT Network Genuinely Isolates Smart Home Devices for Better Security",
    "explanation": "Smart home devices like cameras, smart plugs, and voice assistants generally have weaker built-in security than computers and phones, making them a common entry point for network attacks if compromised. A router feature like the TP-Link Archer BE550's private IoT network, which uses HomeShield and WPA3 encryption to separate these devices onto their own isolated network segment, means that even if one smart device is compromised, an attacker has a harder time reaching your main computers and personal data on the primary network."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a tri-band router actually necessary if I only have a few connected devices?", "a": "For a smaller household with fewer devices and less nearby WiFi congestion, a dual-band router like the NETGEAR RS150 or ASUS TUF Gaming BE6500 in this comparison likely delivers plenty of performance, and the tri-band TP-Link Archer BE550's 6GHz advantage matters most in crowded, multi-network environments." },
  { "q": "How many Deco 7 units do I need for a typical 2-story home?", "a": "TP-Link generally recommends starting with two units for most 2-story homes under the stated coverage figure, with the option to add a third unit if you experience dead zones in specific rooms or a larger, more spread-out floor plan." },
  { "q": "Can I use the ASUS TUF Gaming BE6500's Gaming Port for multiple gaming devices at once?", "a": "No, the dedicated Gaming Port is designed to prioritize traffic for one specific connected device at a time; if multiple devices need gaming-level prioritization simultaneously, you'd need to rely on the router's other quality-of-service features rather than the single dedicated port alone." },
  { "q": "Does upgrading from the NETGEAR RS90 to the RS150 require setting up the network from scratch?", "a": "Generally no, since both use the same Nighthawk app and similar setup process, though you'll still need to go through the initial guided setup for the new router rather than directly transferring settings automatically." },
  { "q": "Is the TP-Link Archer BE550 compatible with TP-Link's Deco mesh system?", "a": "No, the Archer BE550 uses the open EasyMesh standard for expansion, which is compatible with other EasyMesh-certified devices from various brands, but it specifically does not work with TP-Link's separate proprietary Deco mesh product line." },
  { "q": "What happens to my smart home devices if I set up a private IoT network on the TP-Link Archer BE550?", "a": "Your smart home devices will connect to a separate, isolated network segment using WPA3 encryption, which still gives them internet access and normal functionality, but keeps them network-isolated from your primary computers and phones for better security in case a device is compromised." }
