    question: "What is the best desk lamp under $30 for studying?",
    answer: "The Lepro (B08LMPCX3D) is the best for general studying -- 800 lumens, 25 light combinations, diffused panel. For small desks where footprint matters, the iVict clamp (B0C462K8S4) is the better practical choice.",
  },
  {
    question: "What desk lamp is best for a dorm room?",
    answer: "The iVict Gooseneck Clamp (B0BLK6RFGH) -- directional beam, warm dimming options, USB-powered, zero desk footprint. It does not spill light across the room when your roommate is sleeping.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a lamp with color temperature options?",
    answer: "For studying, yes. A warm option (2700K--3000K) for evening sessions reduces blue light exposure before sleep. A cool option (5000K+) for active morning studying improves alertness. Single-temperature lamps lock you into one mode regardless of time of day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are USB-powered desk lamps bright enough?",
    answer: "Yes for most study purposes. The Lepro at 9.5W delivers 800 lumens -- more than adequate for a desk workspace. USB power limits the maximum wattage, but modern LED efficiency means 5--10W USB lamps are genuinely bright.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which desk lamp is best for video calls?",
    answer: "Any lamp with a 5000K--6500K cool/daylight setting placed at eye level or slightly above. The cool-white light makes faces appear cleaner on camera. Warm light (2700K) can make you look orange-toned in video. The Lepro and B08923SXXP both have 5000K+ modes.",
