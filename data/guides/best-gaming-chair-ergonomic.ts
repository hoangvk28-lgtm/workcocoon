  {
    "criterion": "Decide if you actually need the recline range you're paying for",
    "explanation": "Gaming chairs are often marketed on maximum recline angle (130°, 155°, 180°), but a chair reclined past about 130° needs a locking mechanism and a footrest to be usable rather than precarious, and most buyers never use the extreme end of the advertised range.\n\nThis matters for anyone deciding between a cheaper 130°-max chair and a pricier 180°-flat model, the difference in daily usefulness is often smaller than the price gap suggests.\n\nBe honest about whether you'll actually recline fully flat regularly, or whether a mid-range recline with a locking tilt mechanism covers your real use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check bucket seat width against your actual hip and shoulder width",
    "explanation": "The bucket-seat design that defines a gaming chair's look also means the side bolsters are fixed in width, unlike a standard office chair's flat seat pan, so a bucket seat that's too narrow for your frame will pinch, and one that's too wide won't provide the lateral support it's designed for.\n\nThis matters more for larger or smaller-than-average users than for a mid-size frame, where most gaming chairs are designed to fit by default.\n\nCompare the chair's listed seat width and weight capacity against your own measurements rather than assuming one size fits all body types."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh PU leather against fabric for your climate and use pattern",
    "explanation": "PU leather gaming chairs look sleeker out of the box but trap heat during long sessions and are more prone to cracking or peeling after 1-2 years of daily use than a fabric-covered equivalent, which typically breathes better and wears more gradually.\n\nThis matters most for long daily sessions in a warm room, less for occasional or short-session use where heat buildup isn't a factor.\n\nFactor your room's typical temperature and average session length into the material choice, not just which finish looks better in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the lumbar and neck pillows are actually adjustable, not just included",
    "explanation": "Most gaming chairs ship with strap-on lumbar and neck pillows rather than a built-in adjustable lumbar mechanism, and pillow position tends to drift during use, requiring readjustment, unlike a dial or lever-based lumbar system on ergonomic office chairs.\n\nThis matters for anyone with an existing back condition who needs consistent, non-slipping lumbar contact through a multi-hour session.\n\nIf consistent lumbar support matters more to you than aesthetic, compare against ergonomic office chairs with built-in adjustable lumbar rather than assuming a gaming chair's pillow will suffice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check weight capacity margin for a chair that will also tilt and recline",
    "explanation": "A gaming chair's tilt and recline mechanism puts more stress on the frame and gas cylinder than a fixed-position chair, so the rated weight capacity needs more headroom above your body weight than a standard task chair would need for the same longevity.\n\nThis matters for daily, multi-hour use specifically, since the recline mechanism is the first component to fail under sustained near-capacity load.\n\nFavor a chair rated meaningfully above your body weight if you plan to use the recline function regularly, not one rated at just enough."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "What makes a gaming chair actually ergonomic instead of just comfortable?", a: "True ergonomic support comes from adjustable lumbar (like the CAPOT's 8-level system), multi-directional armrests (4D or 6D, as on the GTRACING, Secretlab, and HUANUO picks), and seat depth or recline adjustability that lets you match the chair to your specific body proportions, not just a thick cushion." },
  { q: "Is a 400 lb weight capacity chair overkill if I weigh less than that?", a: "Not necessarily. Higher-rated chairs like the GTRACING and CAPOT (both 400 lbs) generally use sturdier frames and gas lifts even for lighter users, since the rating reflects a static load test rather than a hard ceiling. Extra headroom above your body weight also tends to mean the chair holds its height longer over years of use." },
  { q: "Are Secretlab chairs worth the higher price for ergonomics specifically?", a: "The Titan Evo models offer the deepest recline in this guide (165°) and a magnetic head pillow that other chairs don't replicate, backed by a strong brand track record. Whether that's worth roughly double the price of the GTRACING or CAPOT depends on how much you value recline depth and brand reliability over raw feature adjustability." },
  { q: "What's the difference between 4D and 6D armrests?", a: "4D armrests, found on the GTRACING, Secretlab, and Anda Seat picks, adjust up/down, forward/back, and side to side plus rotation. The HUANUO's 6D armrests add a full 360° rotation range on top of that, giving even finer control over hand and wrist positioning relative to your keyboard." },
  { q: "Should I choose mesh or leatherette for an ergonomic gaming chair?", a: "Mesh, like on the CAPOT, breathes better and stays cooler for long sessions but offers a firmer, less plush feel. Leatherette, like the Secretlab Titan Evo, holds its shape longer and feels more premium but traps more heat. Fabric options like SoftWeave or linen split the difference on breathability and durability." },
