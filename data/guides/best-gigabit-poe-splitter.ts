export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Selectable Voltage DIP Switch Lets One Splitter Serve Devices With Different Voltage Requirements",
    "explanation": "The 802.3bt pick and Procet pick both specifically include a voltage selector allowing either 12V or 24V output from the same physical unit, meaning you don't need to buy separate fixed-voltage splitters for devices with different voltage requirements. This matters if you're deploying the splitter across multiple device types with different voltage needs, or if you're not entirely certain of your specific device's exact voltage requirement, and matters less if you know you specifically need one fixed voltage and nothing else. Check whether a Gigabit splitter offers selectable voltage output if you need flexibility across multiple device types or voltage uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum Wattage at a Selected Voltage May Differ From the Splitter's Maximum Wattage at the Other Voltage Option",
    "explanation": "The Procet pick specifically states different maximum currents depending on which voltage you select (2.15A at 12V versus 1.05A at 24V), both landing at roughly the same 25W ceiling, while the 802.3bt pick specifically maintains a full 51W at either voltage selection, a real difference in how consistently wattage is delivered across voltage options. This matters if you're specifically choosing between the two voltage modes on the same splitter and want to know whether wattage stays constant, and matters less if you've already settled on one voltage and don't plan to switch. Check whether a selectable-voltage splitter maintains consistent maximum wattage across both voltage options, or if one option delivers meaningfully less power than the other."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Metal Housing With a Named IP Rating Provides Different Durability Than a Compact Plastic Enclosure",
    "explanation": "The Procet pick's high-impact metal shell with an IP40 rating offers greater physical durability than the plastic housings on the SICSOLINK and Revotech picks, though IP40 specifically protects against solid objects rather than water, a real distinction from a higher water-resistance rating. This matters if physical durability against impact matters for your specific installation location, and matters less if you need genuine water resistance, where you'd want to verify a higher IP rating instead. Check both the housing material and the specific IP rating number if durability and environmental protection both matter for your installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 2-Pack Bundle Delivers Real Per-Unit Savings Specifically When You Need to Convert Two Devices",
    "explanation": "The SICSOLINK 2-pack works out to a lower per-unit cost than buying two Revotech single units separately, a genuine value consideration if you have two devices needing PoE-to-12V conversion at Gigabit speed. This matters if you're specifically converting two devices at once, where the 2-pack delivers real savings, and matters less if you only have one device, where the single-unit Revotech pick avoids paying for an unused second unit. Count your actual number of devices needing conversion before choosing between a single-unit and 2-pack purchase."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Broad Named Device Compatibility Beyond Cameras Signals Genuine Versatility for Non-Camera PoE Deployments",
    "explanation": "The 802.3bt pick specifically names compatibility with LED strip lights, monitors, speakers, humidifiers, and oil diffusers alongside standard cameras and DVRs, a genuinely broader application range than a splitter marketed only for security camera use. This matters if you're using PoE to power non-camera devices like lighting or other electronics in a smart office or home setup, and matters less if your only use case is standard IP camera power conversion. Check a splitter's named compatible device list if your specific use case extends beyond standard camera or networking equipment."

  { "q": "Do I need a Gigabit-rated PoE splitter for a standard security camera?", "a": "Standard 1080p cameras work fine with a 100Mbps splitter, but a 4K camera or any device benefiting from higher bandwidth genuinely needs a Gigabit-rated splitter like the picks in this comparison to avoid bottlenecking." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a Gigabit PoE splitter?", "a": "Assuming a selectable-voltage splitter delivers the same maximum wattage regardless of which voltage you choose, when some splitters specifically show a wattage difference between their 12V and 24V modes." },
  { "q": "Is the 51W splitter worth the higher price over the SICSOLINK 2-pack?", "a": "If you need higher wattage or 24V output for a demanding PTZ camera or LED installation, the 51W pick's higher price is justified, but for standard 12V cameras, the SICSOLINK 2-pack delivers full Gigabit performance at a much lower cost per unit." },
  { "q": "Can I power an LED lighting installation with a Gigabit PoE splitter?", "a": "Yes, the 802.3bt pick in this comparison specifically names LED strip lights among its supported applications, delivering up to 51W of power suitable for lighting installations beyond typical camera use." },
  { "q": "Does IP40 rating mean a splitter is waterproof for outdoor use?", "a": "No, IP40 specifically protects against solid objects but provides no water resistance rating, so the Procet pick's metal housing offers durability benefits but isn't specifically waterproof for direct outdoor rain exposure." },
  { "q": "How do I know if I need 12V or 24V output for my device?", "a": "Checking your specific device's power specification label or documentation for its exact voltage requirement is the reliable way to confirm which output you need before choosing between a fixed-voltage or selectable-voltage splitter." }
