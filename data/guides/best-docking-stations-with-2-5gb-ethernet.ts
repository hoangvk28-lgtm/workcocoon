export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "Do I need a special router to benefit from a 2.5GbE docking station?",
    a: "Yes. A 2.5GbE dock connected to a typical home router with only 1GbE LAN ports will be capped at gigabit speeds, since the connection can only move as fast as its slowest link. To see the full 2.5Gbps benefit, your router or network switch also needs to support 2.5GbE.",
  },
  {
    q: "When does 2.5Gb ethernet on a docking station actually make a difference?",
    a: "The real benefit shows up during LAN-to-LAN transfers, like moving large files between a docked laptop and a 2.5GbE-capable NAS on the same home network. For regular internet browsing or streaming, your internet connection itself is almost always the bottleneck, not the dock's ethernet speed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a 2.5GbE port slow down the display outputs on a docking station?",
    a: "No, this is a common misconception. The 2.5GbE ethernet chip on the docks in this list typically draws bandwidth from its own dedicated PCIe lane, separate from the lanes handling video output, so adding fast ethernet does not reduce display performance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Wake-on-LAN work through a 2.5GbE docking station?",
    a: "It depends on the specific dock, and support varies by model. Some docks support Wake-on-LAN only while the dock itself remains powered. If you or your IT team relies on WoL for remote laptop management, verify the exact dock's documented Wake-on-LAN behavior before depending on it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a corporate VPN cause problems with a 2.5GbE docking station?",
    a: "Yes, in some cases. Certain corporate VPN clients have a documented history of conflicting with third-party 2.5GbE network adapters used in docking stations. On a managed corporate laptop, driver installation for the dock's ethernet chip may also require IT approval, so it's worth testing compatibility before making the dock part of your daily work setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a Thunderbolt dock and a DisplayLink dock for 2.5GbE?",
    a: "A Thunderbolt Certified dock, like the Plugable TBT-UDM in this list, is driverless and works natively with Thunderbolt or USB4 laptops. A DisplayLink-based dock, like the Anker Prime DL7400, extends multi-monitor support to laptops that don't natively support that many display outputs, but requires the latest DisplayLink driver to be installed first.",
