    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best standing desk often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best standing desk holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best standing desk over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best standing desk you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best standing desk that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What size standing desk do I need for dual monitors?", a: "For two 24-inch monitors: minimum 55 inches wide. For two 27-inch monitors: 60 inches is comfortable, 55 is tight. For two 32-inch monitors: 70 to 72 inches is recommended. Add 4 to 6 inches of margin beyond your measured monitor widths to avoid a cramped setup. Depth matters too: aim for 28 to 30 inches front-to-back for proper screen distance." },
  { q: "Should I use a monitor arm or riser shelf for dual monitors on a standing desk?", a: "A monitor arm is better for most dual-monitor setups. It frees the entire desk surface, allows per-monitor height adjustment, and lets you push screens back further when you do not need them. A riser shelf is simpler and cheaper, but it takes up permanent desk depth and limits adjustment. If you use both screens equally and at the same height, a riser is fine. If one screen is dominant, an arm gives more flexibility." },
  { q: "Do dual monitors make a standing desk wobble more?", a: "Yes, slightly. Two monitors mounted on a fixed riser shift the center of gravity slightly and add weight, which can increase the amplitude of any existing wobble. A dual-motor desk wobbles less than a single-motor desk at the same load. A monitor arm that extends further from the desk edge adds more leverage and can amplify wobble. Keep monitor arms shorter (4 to 6 inches from the desk edge) to minimize the effect." },
  { q: "What standing desk height is correct for dual monitors?", a: "At standing height, your monitor tops should be at or just below eye level, with the screen center at roughly nose height when looking straight ahead. This is different from your keyboard surface height. Raise or lower the desk to your correct keyboard height first (2 to 3 inches below your standing elbow), then adjust monitor height via an arm or riser to meet your eye level independently." },
  { q: "Can I use a 48-inch desk for dual monitors?", a: "A 48-inch desk fits two 24-inch monitors side by side with minimal clearance. It does not comfortably fit two 27-inch monitors without a monitor arm that pushes them close together. If you plan to use 27-inch or larger screens, a 55-inch or wider desk provides a better experience. A monitor arm on a 48-inch desk can position screens more efficiently but limits keyboard space on a narrow surface." },
