It is the most affordable dual-slot aluminum stand with independent per-slot adjustment and a lifetime warranty.

    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best vertical macbook stands (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best vertical macbook stands (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best vertical macbook stands (2026) over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best vertical macbook stands (2026) you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best vertical macbook stands (2026) that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Can I use a vertical stand with a MacBook in clamshell mode?", a: "Yes. Clamshell mode is the primary use case for a vertical MacBook stand. Connect an external display, keyboard, and mouse, close the MacBook lid, and place it in the stand. The MacBook remains powered and drives the external display while the built-in screen stays off." },
  { q: "Do I need a MacBook-specific stand or will a universal stand work?", a: "Universal adjustable stands (OMOTON, Psitek) work correctly with all MacBook models. MacBook-specific stands (HumanCentric, Twelve South BookArc) provide a more precise fit and often a cleaner aesthetic, but universal stands hold the MacBook securely without any compromise." },
  { q: "Which MacBook models fit the Twelve South BookArc?", a: "The Twelve South BookArc comes with three interchangeable silicone inserts sized for different MacBook thicknesses. It fits MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. Check the current product listing for the specific insert sizes included, as they vary by product generation." },
  { q: "Will a vertical stand scratch my MacBook?", a: "All stands in this roundup use silicone-covered contact points that protect the MacBook chassis from scratching. The MacBook-specific stands (HumanCentric, Twelve South BookArc) use precision-fit inserts that contact only the safe areas of the laptop. Universal stands use adjustable silicone pads." },
  { q: "Can I put a MacBook with a case in a vertical stand?", a: "Most adjustable vertical stands accommodate a MacBook with a thin case as long as the case thickness stays within the stand's adjustment range. MacBook-specific stands with fixed-size inserts may not accommodate thick cases. Check the maximum slot width against your MacBook-plus-case thickness." }
