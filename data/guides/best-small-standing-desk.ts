    q: "What is the smallest electric standing desk available?",
    a: "The smallest electric standing desk on this list is the HUANUO 32\" at 32x21 inches. It includes two built-in drawers. Most electric standing desk motors require a minimum crossbeam width, which limits practical minimums to around 28\" to 32\". Below 28\" is rare and typically requires custom or specialty manufacturers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I fit a 27\" monitor on a 40\" desk?",
    a: "Yes. A 27\" monitor has a typical width of 24 to 25 inches with the stand. On a 40\" desk, the monitor centered leaves approximately 7 to 8 inches of lateral margin on each side. This is comfortable for a single-monitor setup. For dual monitors at 40\", a monitor arm is required to overlap the monitors and fit both within the width.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much wall space do I need for a 40\" standing desk?",
    a: "The desk itself is 40\" wide. Add at least 4 to 6 inches on each side for cables, a monitor arm clamp, and comfortable movement. A 40\" desk needs approximately 48 to 52 inches of clear wall. Verify your available wall measurement before ordering.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a smaller desk wobble more at standing height?",
    a: "Wobble at standing height is primarily determined by the frame design (2-stage vs 3-stage legs) and motor quality, not desk width. A 40\" desk with a quality 2-stage frame will wobble at similar levels to a 48\" desk with the same frame. The 40\" is actually slightly more stable in the forward-back direction because the shorter crossbeam has less flex.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 48 inches considered small for a standing desk?",
    a: "In the standing desk market, 48\" is the minimum standard width - most brands start their lineup at 48\". In room layout terms, 48\" is only small relative to 55\" or 60\" options. If your available wall space is 48\" or more, you can fit a standard-width desk. The truly compact options are 40\" and 32\", which genuinely require less wall space.",
