Ink economics matter more here too, since a printer left untouched over a three-month summer break can come back with dried-out cartridges.",

    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    q: "Is it actually worth buying a printer for a dorm room?",
    a: "It depends on your print volume. If you only print a handful of pages a month, campus library or lab printing can be cheaper over four years than buying a printer plus replacing dried-out ink. If you print regularly or plan to split the cost with roommates, owning one like the Canon PIXMA TS4320 or the shared-use Canon TS6420 usually pays off.",

  {
    q: "Why did my dorm printer's ink dry out over summer break?",
    a: "Inkjet cartridges left unused for an extended period, like a typical 3-month summer break, commonly dry out at the print head, and replacing a dried-out cartridge set can cost $40 to $60. Laser printers and the inkless thermal pick in this list avoid the problem entirely since they don't use liquid ink.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the most packable printer for a student who moves every year?",
    a: "The Canon PIXMA TS3720 is the lightest full inkjet all-in-one in this list, and the inkless Bluetooth thermal printer is even smaller and has no scanner lid or paper tray to protect during a move, making it the easiest to fit in a backpack or moving box.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do multiple roommates share one dorm printer?",
    a: "Most wireless printers in this list can be added to more than one laptop or phone over the same wifi network, so each roommate installs the manufacturer's app or driver once and connects independently. A model with a clear display, like the Canon PIXMA TS6520, cuts down on repeated troubleshooting for roommates who aren't as familiar with the printer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a printer with a scanner for college assignments?",
    a: "If your coursework occasionally requires scanning a signed form or a single page, a basic flatbed scanner like the one on the Canon PIXMA TS3720 is enough. If a professor regularly requires scanning multi-page packets, the Canon PIXMA TR4720's auto document feeder saves real time over feeding pages one at a time.",
