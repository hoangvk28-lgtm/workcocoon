The listing also documents S.M.A.R.T. health monitoring and TRIM support, features that budget external drives frequently skip entirely.\n\nAgainst the other picks here, the real difference is that SSK spells out its speed-consistency mechanism (SLC caching using roughly a quarter of available capacity) rather than just quoting a top speed number, and it directly addresses the capacity-confusion question buyers hit on every SSD purchase: a 128GB drive will show closer to 116GB in Windows because of how GB is calculated differently between the drive and the operating system, a normal result of decimal versus binary math, not a shortfall in the drive itself.\n\nBest for buyers who want the fastest realistic transfer speed available at this price and plan to move the drive between a Windows PC and other devices regularly. The tradeoff is capacity: 128GB fills up fast with video or large creative files, so treat this as a fast, all-purpose drive rather than a long-term archive.",

The listing specifically calls out iPhone 15 and newer USB-C iPhones as a target device, alongside the usual Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux support.\n\nCompared to the SSK pick above, this drive trades roughly 100MB/s of rated speed (450MB/s versus 550MB/s) for a lower price and an aluminum alloy housing the listing specifically markets for heat dissipation and shock resistance, a detail worth noting since cheap external drives often skip housing material specs entirely.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB Generation, Not Just the Speed Number",
    "explanation": "Every drive in this price range advertises a top speed like 450, 500, or 550MB/s, but that number only means something in the context of which USB standard actually delivers it. USB 3.2 Gen 2 can genuinely reach speeds near 1,050MB/s in ideal conditions, while USB 3.1 or Gen 1 drives top out lower even with similar-sounding marketing language. Check the listing for the actual USB generation (3.1, 3.2 Gen 1, or 3.2 Gen 2) rather than relying on the headline MB/s figure alone, since the real-world ceiling also depends on your computer's own port supporting that same standard."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Advertised Capacity vs What You'll Actually See",
    "explanation": "A drive listed as 128GB or 256GB will show a smaller number once plugged into a computer, typically several gigabytes less, because manufacturers calculate capacity in decimal gigabytes (1GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes) while Windows and macOS report it in binary gigabytes (where 1GB is closer to 1,073,741,824 bytes). This is normal math, not a defect or a missing chunk of storage, but it does mean a 128GB drive realistically holds closer to 116GB of usable space. Budget for that gap when deciding between a 128GB and 256GB option rather than assuming the full advertised number will be available."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pre-Formatted File System for Cross-Platform Use",
    "explanation": "Most budget external SSDs ship pre-formatted in exFAT specifically because it is the one common format both Windows and macOS can read and write to without reformatting, unlike NTFS (Windows-only for writing) or APFS and HFS+ (Mac-only). If a listing doesn't specify the out-of-box format, check the product description or Q&A section before assuming it works across both operating systems immediately. Reformatting a drive to a single-platform format defeats the point of buying a portable drive meant to move between devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included Cables and Adapters",
    "explanation": "A drive's sticker price only tells part of the story if it ships with just one cable type and your devices use a different port. Check whether the box includes both a USB-C cable and a USB-A adapter (or cable), since needing to separately buy an adapter effectively adds several dollars to what looked like the cheapest option. This matters most for anyone splitting time between an older USB-A laptop and a newer USB-C one, or moving files to and from a USB-C phone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Drop and Shock Resistance Claims",
    "explanation": "Solid-state drives have no moving parts, so they inherently handle drops far better than a traditional external hard drive, but that doesn't mean every SSD is equally rugged. Some drives in this price range describe an aluminum housing for shock resistance without citing a specific drop height or G-force rating, while others make no durability claim at all. Treat a vague \"durable\" or \"shockproof\" description with some skepticism unless the listing states an actual tested figure, and don't assume a budget SSD can survive being dropped from height the way a ruggedized, higher-priced drive might be built to."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Health Monitoring Support Is Inconsistent at This Price",
    "explanation": "Features like TRIM (which helps maintain consistent write speeds over time) and S.M.A.R.T. monitoring (which reports a drive's health status) exist on some budget external SSDs but not others, and support tends to be inconsistent over standard USB 3.x connections even when a drive nominally includes the feature. If long-term reliability tracking matters to you, look specifically for a listing that names TRIM or S.M.A.R.T. support directly, like the SSK pick in this comparison, rather than assuming every SSD offers it by default."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will a portable SSD under $50 work on both my Mac and my Windows PC without reformatting?", "a": "Yes, as long as it ships pre-formatted in exFAT, which all four picks in this comparison do. exFAT is readable and writable on both Windows and macOS natively, unlike NTFS (Windows-only for writing) or APFS (Mac-only), so you shouldn't need to reformat the drive for basic cross-platform use." },
  { "q": "Why does my new 128GB or 256GB SSD show less space than advertised?", "a": "This is expected and not a defect. Manufacturers list capacity in decimal gigabytes while your operating system reports it in binary gigabytes, so a 128GB drive typically shows closer to 116GB, and a 256GB drive closer to 238GB, once plugged in. The gap is a normal result of two different counting systems, not storage that's missing or been used up." },
  { "q": "Is a $30-40 SSD actually faster than a similarly priced external hard drive?", "a": "In practical terms, yes for most everyday use. A solid-state drive has no moving parts, so it starts up instantly, transfers small files faster, and survives drops and bumps far better than a traditional hard drive of similar price. An HDD can still offer more storage per dollar at larger capacities, but at the sub $50, sub 256GB tier covered here, an SSD is generally the more practical choice for portability and durability." },
  { "q": "How do I know what speed I'll actually get when transferring files?", "a": "Your real transfer speed is capped by the slowest link in the chain: the drive's own rated speed, the cable you use, and the port on your computer all have to support the same standard for you to see the advertised number. Plugging a USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive into an older USB 3.0 port, for example, will bottleneck it well below its rated ceiling regardless of what the drive itself is capable of." },
  { "q": "Do I need to manually maintain an external SSD, like running TRIM?", "a": "Support for TRIM and S.M.A.R.T. health monitoring is inconsistent across external drives at this price point, and generally isn't something you manually trigger even when it is supported. If a listing specifically documents TRIM or S.M.A.R.T. support, like the SSK pick in this comparison, the drive handles it automatically in the background; if it doesn't mention either, assume neither is reliably available and don't expect to check drive health the way you might on an internal SSD." },
  { "q": "Can I use one of these drives to back up photos from an iPhone directly?", "a": "It depends on your iPhone's port and the drive's connector support. Drives with a USB-C connector, like the LINTYLE pick which specifically lists iPhone 15 and newer compatibility, work with current USB-C iPhones. Older iPhones with a Lightning port aren't compatible with any of the drives in this comparison without a separate Lightning adapter, which none of these listings include." }
