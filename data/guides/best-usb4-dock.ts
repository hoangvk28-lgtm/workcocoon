  {
    "criterion": "USB4 Branding Alone Does Not Guarantee 40Gbps Real-World Bandwidth",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo ThinkPad USB4 Dock 5000 specifically states its 40Gbps bandwidth quadruples USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 performance, a concrete comparative figure, while some products marketed simply as 'USB4' don't disclose an actual throughput number at all. This matters if you plan to transfer large files or run high-bandwidth peripherals simultaneously, where the real 40Gbps ceiling directly affects performance, and matters less if you only use the dock for a single display and charging. Look for a dock's specifically stated Gbps figure in the listing rather than assuming the USB4 label alone guarantees maximum throughput."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock's Maximum Display Resolution Depends on Your Laptop's USB4 Controller, Not Just the Dock",
    "explanation": "The StarTech and Lenovo picks both state support for dual 4K at 144Hz or single 8K at 60Hz, but these figures assume your specific laptop's USB4 or Thunderbolt controller can output DisplayPort Alt Mode at that same resolution and refresh rate, meaning an older or lower-tier laptop may not actually achieve the dock's maximum stated display specs. This matters directly if you're pairing the dock with an older laptop model, and matters less if you're using a recent laptop with a confirmed USB4 or Thunderbolt 4/5 port. Check your specific laptop's own display output specifications against the dock's stated maximums before assuming you'll get the full advertised resolution and refresh rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Driverless Setup Solves a Real Cross-Platform Compatibility Problem in Mixed-Device Environments",
    "explanation": "The StarTech pick's driverless design specifically avoids OS-specific software installation, meaning the same dock behaves identically whether connected to a Mac or a Windows laptop, a genuinely useful trait in shared desks, meeting rooms, or households where different family members' devices connect to the same dock. This matters if your dock will regularly serve multiple different laptops or operating systems, and matters less if the dock is permanently paired with one specific laptop you already know is compatible. Check whether a listing specifically states driverless or plug-and-play compatibility if you anticipate connecting different devices to the same dock over time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In NVMe Storage Expansion Adds Genuine Value, But Requires a Separate SSD Purchase",
    "explanation": "The WAVLINK pick's M.2 PCIe NVMe enclosure lets you add up to 8TB of fast internal storage directly into the dock, but the SSD itself is sold separately, meaning the dock's advertised storage capability requires an additional purchase before you can actually use it. This matters if you're comparing total cost across docks, where a cheaper dock with no storage slot might still cost less overall than a storage-enabled dock plus a new SSD, and matters less if you already own a compatible M.2 NVMe SSD you can install. Factor in the cost of a separate SSD purchase before assuming a storage-enabled dock is automatically the better value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Host Charging Wattage Should Match Your Specific Laptop's Actual Power Draw Under Load",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison state 100W of laptop charging capability, but a laptop's actual power draw varies significantly by model, meaning a thin ultrabook might charge comfortably at 100W while a power-hungry gaming or workstation laptop could draw more than the dock can supply, resulting in slow charging or battery drain during heavy use. This matters directly if you use a high-performance laptop with a higher-wattage OEM charger, and matters less if your laptop's original charger is rated at 100W or below. Check your laptop's original charger's wattage rating and compare it against a dock's stated charging output before assuming 100W will fully cover your specific laptop's power needs."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I use a USB4 dock with a laptop that only has a USB-C port, not USB4 or Thunderbolt?", "a": "Yes, USB4 docks are generally backward compatible with standard USB-C ports, but you'll only get the speed and display capabilities that your laptop's actual USB-C controller supports, not the dock's full USB4 potential." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between these four USB4 docks?", "a": "Assuming any dock labeled USB4 will deliver the full 40Gbps bandwidth and maximum display resolution regardless of their specific laptop model, when the actual performance ceiling is set by whichever is lower between the dock's and the laptop's USB4 controller capabilities." },
  { "q": "Is the Razer USB 4 Dock worth the extra cost over the StarTech pick if I don't need 14 ports?", "a": "If you only need basic display and charging connectivity, the StarTech pick's driverless simplicity at a lower price is the better fit, but if you regularly connect many peripherals like external drives and speakers, the Razer's 14 ports justify the higher price." },
  { "q": "How do I install an SSD into the WAVLINK dock's M.2 enclosure?", "a": "The enclosure is designed for tool-free or simple screwdriver installation of a compatible M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD, and the specific installation steps are included in the dock's documentation, though the SSD itself must be purchased separately." },
  { "q": "Do these docks work with both Windows 10/11 and macOS without any configuration changes?", "a": "The StarTech and Lenovo picks specifically state cross-platform compatibility with minimal or no configuration, while checking each specific listing's stated OS compatibility is worth doing before purchase if you plan to switch between operating systems regularly." },
  { "q": "Can I daisy-chain multiple USB4 docks together for even more ports?", "a": "USB4's underlying protocol supports daisy-chaining compatible devices, but checking each specific dock's documentation for daisy-chain support is worth doing, since not every USB4 dock is designed to be chained with another dock in this way." }
