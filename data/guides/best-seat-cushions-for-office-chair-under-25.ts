export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Look for a stated foam density or thickness, not just \"premium memory foam\"",
    explanation: "Nearly every listing in this category calls its foam \"premium\" or \"high-density,\" but only some give you an actual comparable number, whether that's a specific density rating or an exact center thickness measurement in inches. A stated thickness (like 3.3 inches) or explicit high-density language backed by a shape-retention claim tells you more concretely what to expect than marketing language alone, since foam that's genuinely dense enough to resist compressing flat over months of daily use is the whole point of the cushion. When comparing two similarly priced cushions, prioritize the one willing to state an actual number over one that only uses adjectives."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match the cover material to your climate and how warm you run while sitting",
    explanation: "Seat cushion covers in this price range come in a few different materials, commonly a breathable mesh, a standard washable fabric, or a softer velvet-style cover, and each retains heat differently during extended sitting. A breathable mesh cover allows more air circulation and stays cooler, which matters if you sit in a warm room or tend to run hot, while a velvet or standard fabric cover feels softer to the touch but traps more heat over a long session. If you've had a previous cushion feel uncomfortably warm after an hour or two, prioritize a listing that specifically calls out a breathable mesh cover."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Check whether the U-shaped cutout depth suits your actual body size",
    explanation: "The defining feature of a tailbone-relief cushion is its U-shaped cutout, which suspends the tailbone above the cushion surface to reduce direct pressure, but the depth and size of that cutout isn't identical across every listing, and a cutout too shallow or narrow for your body may not actually suspend your tailbone as intended. Some listings specifically state a larger overall size designed to accommodate a wider range of body shapes, a detail worth checking if a standard-size cushion has felt like it didn't quite fit correctly before. If you're unsure, a listing explicitly marketed as \"large\" or accommodating different body shapes is the safer choice over a standard unspecified size."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Decide if you need portability features like a carry handle",
    explanation: "If you plan to use the same cushion in more than one place, moving it between your office chair, your car, and travel, a built-in carry handle makes that genuinely easier than a cushion with no handle at all, which you'd need to carry awkwardly under an arm. Not every cushion in this price range includes this feature, so it's worth checking specifically if multi-location use is part of your actual plan. If the cushion is staying on one chair permanently, a carry handle adds little practical value and isn't worth prioritizing over other specs."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Consider whether your typical sitting duration calls for an extended-use design",
    explanation: "Some cushions in this comparison are marketed generally for office chair use, while at least one specifically states it's designed around sitting for more than 8 hours at a stretch, with a correspondingly larger size and slower-rebound foam meant to hold support over that extended period rather than just the first hour. If your job involves genuinely long, uninterrupted sitting sessions most days, a cushion designed and sized specifically for that use case is a more deliberate match than a general-purpose one. If you get up and move around frequently throughout the day, this distinction matters less."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Will a seat cushion actually help with tailbone or lower back pain?",
    a: "Many buyers report relief from tailbone pressure using a U-shaped cutout cushion, since it's specifically designed to suspend the tailbone above the seating surface rather than pressing directly against a hard chair. For persistent or severe pain, consult a healthcare provider, since a cushion is a comfort accessory rather than a medical treatment."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if a cushion's foam is actually high-density or just marketing language?",
    a: "Look for a listing that states a specific density figure or an exact thickness measurement in inches, rather than only using adjectives like \"premium\" or \"supportive\" with no number attached. A stated measurement gives you something concrete to compare against other cushions."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use these cushions on a car seat or other non-office chair?",
    a: "Yes, most cushions in this comparison are explicitly marketed for use across multiple seat types, including car seats, airplane seats, and gaming chairs, not just office chairs. Check the specific listing for its stated compatible seat types if this matters to your use case."
  },
  {
    q: "Do these cushions come off easily for washing?",
    a: "Yes, every pick in this comparison has a removable, machine-washable cover, typically secured with a zipper for easy removal. Check the specific listing for the exact cover material and washing instructions before your first wash."
  },
  {
    q: "Will the cushion slide around on my office chair?",
    a: "Every pick in this comparison includes a non-slip rubber base or bottom specifically designed to keep it in place during normal use and movement. If you notice sliding on an unusually smooth or angled chair surface, double-check the cushion is seated flat and centered on the chair."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a larger cushion always better than a standard size?",
    a: "Not necessarily; it depends on your chair's seat dimensions and your own body size. A larger cushion accommodates a wider range of body shapes and can feel more supportive, but it may not fit as well on a narrower chair seat. Check the cushion's stated dimensions against your chair's actual seat size before assuming larger is always the better choice."
