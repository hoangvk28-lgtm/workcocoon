    title: "Buying a thin desk mat that curls at the edges",

  {
    title: "Using a cloth pad without a waterproof layer on a coffee desk",
    body: "Cloth mouse pads absorb spills and develop odors if not dried promptly. If you regularly have drinks at your desk, a PU leather desk mat that wipes clean is a more practical choice.",
  },
  {
    title: "Buying an XL gaming pad for a small desk",
    body: "A 35-inch extended pad on a 30-inch desk will overhang the edge and bunch up. Measure your desk first and buy a pad that leaves 2-3 inches on each side.",
  },
  {
    title: "Assuming a desk mat replaces a proper mouse pad for gaming",
    body: "Leather desk mats have inconsistent texture - fine for work mice at 800-1600 DPI, but at 3200+ DPI used in competitive gaming, dedicated gaming cloth pads track more accurately. Use a gaming pad on top of the mat if you need both desk protection and precision.",

// ─── FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const faq: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a desk mat and a mouse pad?",
    a: "A desk mat covers the full desk surface (30-35+ inches wide) to protect the desk and unify the aesthetic. A mouse pad covers only the mouse zone and is optimized for tracking performance. Desk mats are better for desk protection and aesthetics; mouse pads are better for precision and gaming.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a desk mat worth it?",
    a: "Yes, especially for desks that cost $100+. A $20-$30 desk mat protects the entire surface from scratches, heat, and spills, and makes the desk look significantly cleaner. For wooden desks, it's particularly worth it. For pure mouse tracking, a dedicated mouse pad still wins on surface consistency.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a desk mat as a mouse pad?",
    a: "Yes - most desk mats work fine as mouse surfaces for everyday computing. For casual use, work tasks, and gaming at 800-1600 DPI, a PU leather or felt mat is fully adequate. For competitive gaming at 3200+ DPI, a dedicated cloth gaming pad offers more consistent tracking.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size desk mat should I get?",
    a: "Measure your desk and subtract 3-4 inches from each side for the mat. A 40-inch desk works well with a 31-35-inch mat. Make sure the mat doesn't overhang the front edge - it should sit flush with room for your wrists to rest naturally.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you clean a desk mat?",
    a: "PU leather mats: wipe with a damp cloth. For stains, a drop of mild dish soap on a microfiber cloth works well. Felt mats: use a lint roller for dust; spot-clean with a damp cloth for spills and let air-dry. Cloth mouse pads: hand wash with mild soap and cold water, then air-dry flat.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are extended mouse pads the same as desk mats?",
    a: "They overlap but are not identical. Extended mouse pads (like the Ktrio XL) are cloth-based and optimized for mouse tracking - they cover the keyboard and mouse zone but are typically thinner and gaming-focused. Desk mats are usually PU leather or felt, thicker, and focused on desk protection and aesthetics over tracking performance.",
