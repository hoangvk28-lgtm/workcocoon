export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirmed Cross-Brand Compatibility Matters More in Mixed-Laptop Households and Offices",
    "explanation": "The Anker Nano pick specifically confirms compatibility across Dell XPS, Lenovo ThinkPad, HP Spectre, and most Windows laptops with USB-C, a direct disclosure that matters if your household or office uses laptops from multiple different manufacturers, since not every 'universal' dock has been explicitly tested and confirmed against every brand. This matters significantly if you need one dock to reliably serve multiple different laptop brands over time, and matters less if you and everyone using the dock share the same laptop brand and model. Look for a dock that specifically names the laptop brands it's confirmed compatible with, rather than accepting a generic 'universal' or 'USB-C compatible' claim without specifics."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Enterprise IT Management Features Provide Real Value Only in a Managed Fleet Context",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo ThinkPad Universal Dock's support for PXE boot, Wake-on-LAN, MAC Address Pass Through, and automatic remote firmware updates are specifically designed for IT departments managing many docks across an organization, features that provide essentially no practical benefit to a single home user who manually manages their own one dock. This matters significantly if you're deploying docks across a company or organization where centralized management genuinely saves IT staff time, and matters much less for personal or single-desk use where these enterprise features go unused. Consider whether you're purchasing for individual use or fleet deployment before paying a premium for IT management features that only deliver value at scale."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dock Requiring an Active Laptop Connection to Activate Its Ports Behaves Differently From an Always-On Design",
    "explanation": "The Anker Nano pick's listing specifically notes that its blue light strip and all ports only activate when a laptop is connected via the upstream port, meaning you can't use the dock's USB ports to charge a phone or other device independently when no laptop is docked, unlike the Lenovo Travel Dock's specifically disclosed always-on USB port that continues providing power even when the laptop is disconnected. This matters if you want to use the dock's ports for device charging independent of whether your laptop is currently connected, and matters less if you only ever use the dock while your laptop is actively docked. Check whether a dock's ports require an active laptop connection to function, or whether specific always-on ports remain powered independently, based on your actual intended use pattern."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Both USB-C and USB-A Host Compatibility Extends a Dock's Usable Lifespan Across Different Laptop Generations",
    "explanation": "The HP Universal Dock G2 specifically supports both USB Type-C and USB Type-A host connections, meaning the same dock can work with a newer USB-C laptop or an older laptop that only has USB-A ports, a genuine flexibility the USB-C-only picks in this comparison don't offer. This matters if you anticipate using the dock across laptop upgrades that might span both older USB-A and newer USB-C port generations, and matters less if you're confident all your current and future laptops will have USB-C ports. Check whether a dock specifically supports both USB-C and USB-A host connections if you want a longer usable lifespan across different laptop generations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Disclosed Recycled Content Percentage Is a Verifiable Sustainability Claim Worth More Than Vague Eco-Marketing",
    "explanation": "The Lenovo Travel Dock specifically states its chassis uses 66% Post-Consumer Recycled Content, a concrete, checkable figure that Lenovo positions as the greenest dock in their current lineup, a meaningfully more substantive claim than generic 'eco-friendly' language with no specific percentage or standard behind it. This matters if sustainable material sourcing is a genuine purchasing consideration for you, and matters less if environmental material sourcing isn't a priority in your decision. Look for a dock listing's specifically stated recycled content percentage or similar concrete sustainability figure rather than accepting vague environmental marketing claims without backing numbers."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the Anker Nano dock work if I switch from a Dell laptop to a Lenovo laptop later?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically confirms compatibility across Dell XPS, Lenovo ThinkPad, HP Spectre, and most Windows laptops with USB-C, so switching laptop brands later should not require replacing the dock." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a universal USB-C USB4 dock?", "a": "Assuming a generic 'universal compatible' label guarantees the dock works flawlessly across every specific laptop brand and model, when checking for explicitly named confirmed brands in a listing gives much stronger assurance than an unspecific universal compatibility claim." },
  { "q": "Is the Lenovo ThinkPad Universal Dock worth it for a single home office desk?", "a": "For a single home user, the enterprise IT management features like PXE boot and remote firmware updates provide little practical benefit, so the Anker Nano or HP Universal Dock G2 likely deliver better value for individual, non-fleet use." },
  { "q": "Can I charge my phone using the Anker Nano dock's USB ports without my laptop connected?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states all ports, including the light strip indicator, only activate when a laptop is connected via the upstream port, so you'll need your laptop docked for the ports to function." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my older laptop with USB-A will work with these docks?", "a": "The HP USB-C/A Universal Dock G2 specifically supports both USB-C and USB-A host connections, making it the best choice in this comparison if you need to connect an older USB-A-only laptop rather than a newer USB-C model." },
  { "q": "Does the Lenovo Travel Dock's base model include enough power for my laptop?", "a": "The base model includes a 100W USB-C charger providing 65W power delivery, and checking your specific laptop's power requirements against this figure is worth doing, since an optional 135W charger is available separately if you need the full 100W delivered to your laptop." }
