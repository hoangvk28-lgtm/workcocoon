  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "Does Windows 11 install printer drivers automatically?",
    a: "Yes, Windows 11 usually detects a new printer and installs a basic driver automatically over USB or the network. That built-in driver covers basic printing, but scan tools, ink-level monitoring, and maintenance features typically require installing the manufacturer's full driver package separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "My printer shows offline, is it broken?",
    a: "Not necessarily. A printer showing offline in Windows 11 is frequently caused by the Print Spooler service, a background process that manages print jobs and can hang or crash independently of the printer hardware. Restarting the spooler service or running the built-in Windows 11 printer troubleshooter resolves many of these cases without needing a new printer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I use the Windows 11 troubleshooter before buying a new printer?",
    a: "Yes, it's a reasonable first diagnostic step. The troubleshooter under Settings can detect and fix common issues like a stalled spooler service or an incorrect default printer setting, both of which are frequently misdiagnosed as printer hardware failure.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a laser printer more reliable on Windows 11 than an inkjet?",
    a: "Laser printers, like the Brother DCP-L2640DW in this list, generally report fewer offline and connectivity complaints on Windows forums than budget inkjets, though this is based on aggregate reports rather than a guarantee for any individual unit. Laser engines also cost more upfront and don't print in color.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Ethernet solve Windows 11 printer connectivity issues?",
    a: "A wired Ethernet connection, available on the Epson EcoTank ET-4800 in this list, avoids the Wi-Fi dropouts that sometimes follow a router reboot or firmware update. It's a good option for a shared home office printer where stability matters more than wireless convenience.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will an ink subscription trial start billing me automatically?",
