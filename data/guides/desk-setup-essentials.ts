These three address the most common desk problems before anything else." },
  { q: "How do I make a small desk setup look clean?", a: "Hide cables first (under-desk tray or clips), then add a desk mat that defines the workspace, then keep only daily-use items on the surface. The three-step sequence -- cable management, mat, ruthless surface editing -- transforms most small desks without buying anything expensive." },
  { q: "What should every work-from-home desk have?", a: "Beyond the basics (monitor, keyboard, mouse): a powered USB hub for connecting everything, a clamp desk lamp or monitor light bar, cable management, and a headphone hook. These four items address the practical daily-use gaps in most home office setups." },
  { q: "Are desk accessories worth buying?", a: "The right ones are. A $20 cable tray and a $15 headphone hook have immediate, visible impact every day. A $50 RGB light strip has zero functional benefit. The criterion is: does this make my workspace easier to use or more comfortable? If yes, worth it. If it's purely decorative, probably not." },
  { q: "What should I buy first for a better desk setup?", a: "A cable management tray -- it costs $20, takes 5 minutes, and immediately makes everything else look more intentional. Second: a desk lamp with a clamp mount. These two purchases change the baseline of any desk setup before anything else." },
  { q: "How can I improve my desk setup on a budget?", a: "Under $50 combination: cable clips ($8), a headphone hook ($12), and a compact desk organizer ($18). These three eliminate the most common visual clutter on any desk. Under $100: add a desk mat ($35) and you've transformed the setup's appearance without touching the monitor or lighting." },
