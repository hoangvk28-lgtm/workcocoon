      "The Bush Home Key West earns the top spot based on the highest rating and the largest review count in this group (over 4,200 reviews at 4.4 stars). At around $130, it is also the most affordable entry in this lateral guide, making it a strong value for shoppers who want a lateral design without moving far above the budget tier. The Pure White Oak finish is clean and light, working well in modern, coastal-inspired, or casual home offices. Lateral drawers open wide for full file access without digging through a deep stack. Full-extension drawer slides and a lock are included. Meets CARB standards for low chemical emissions. The wider, lower profile looks more like furniture and less like office equipment.",

The Vintage Oak finish has a warm, slightly aged tone that pairs naturally with traditional and transitional home office furniture. Sauder's patented T-slot assembly system is easier than standard cam-lock methods, which many buyers in the reviews specifically call out as a positive. Cord management opening on the rear panel keeps the work surface tidy. Decorative base molding gives it a furniture-grade appearance rather than office-equipment look. At 35.5 inches wide, the flat top surface is large enough to serve as a printer stand or display shelf.",

Classic Cherry is a traditional reddish-brown tone that pairs well with cherry or mahogany-toned desks in formal or executive home offices.

The Estate Black laminate has a subtle wood-grain texture, giving it more visual warmth than a plain painted metal surface - it reads as wood furniture rather than office equipment. At around $205, it is priced accessibly for a dark-finish lateral cabinet. T-slot assembly system applies here as with other Sauder products.",

    q: "Are any wood file cabinets under $500 actually solid wood?",
    a: "Most are not. Bush Home and Sauder products in this range use engineered wood with laminate or wood-grain veneer surfaces. The Martin Furniture Huntington Oxford at around $499 uses select hardwood veneer over a composite core, which is a step up in surface quality but still not solid hardwood throughout. True solid hardwood file cabinets typically start at $600 to $800.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between lateral and vertical file cabinets?",
    a: "Lateral cabinets are wider than they are deep, typically 30 to 36 inches wide. Files sit side by side, allowing easier access without digging through a deep stack. They also provide a useful flat top surface for a printer or display. Vertical cabinets are narrower (15 to 18 inches) and deeper (25 to 29 inches), taking less wall space but protruding further from the wall. All seven picks in this guide are lateral designs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a lateral file cabinet as a printer stand?",
    a: "Yes. Lateral cabinets typically have a flat top surface 30 to 36 inches wide and 18 to 20 inches deep at 28 to 30 inches tall, which accommodates most home printers at a comfortable height. Confirm the top surface weight capacity against your specific printer before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between Bush Home and Sauder file cabinets?",
    a: "Both are US market leaders in ready-to-assemble home office furniture using engineered wood with laminate finishes. Bush Home tends toward cleaner, more contemporary styling. Sauder has a wider range of traditional styles and a patented T-slot assembly system many buyers find easier than standard cam-lock systems. Neither uses solid hardwood in this price range.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which wood finish is best for a traditional home office?",
    a: "Classic Cherry (Sauder Heritage Hill) and Harvest Cherry (Bush Home Cabot) suit formal, traditional offices and pair well with mahogany or cherry-toned desks. Vintage Oak (Sauder Palladia) has wide appeal across traditional and transitional styles. Grand Walnut (Sauder Clifford Place) is a mid-century modern choice with a cooler, darker tone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do letter-size files fit in these lateral cabinets?",
    a: "Yes. All seven cabinets in this guide accept both letter-size and legal-size hanging files. Lateral drawers typically accommodate files oriented front-to-back or side-to-side, depending on the rail configuration. Check the product listing for the rail system included or whether an optional legal-size kit is needed.",
