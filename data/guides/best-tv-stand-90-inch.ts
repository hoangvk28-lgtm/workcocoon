export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 90 inch tv stand often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 90 inch tv stand holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 90 inch tv stand over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 90 inch tv stand you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 90 inch tv stand that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Will any TV stand fit a 90 inch TV?", a: "No. Many stands marketed for \"large TVs\" are only tested and rated up to 85 inches. Always check the listing for an explicit statement that the stand fits TVs up to 90 inches, and compare the stand's weight capacity against your specific TV's actual weight, which can be 60 to 90 lbs for a 90 inch panel." },
  { q: "Do fireplace TV stands for 90 inch TVs come fully assembled?", a: "No. The fireplace insert and the cabinet typically ship as separate components in separate boxes. Assembly involves building the cabinet frame and then installing and wiring the fireplace insert into its designated opening, which takes longer than assembling a standard TV console." },
  { q: "Is a floating wall-mounted TV stand safe for a 90 inch TV?", a: "It can be, but only if it is anchored into real wall studs rather than drywall anchors alone. The combined weight of a 90 inch TV, the cabinet, and any fireplace insert can exceed 150 to 200 lbs, so the mounting hardware needs to span multiple studs and be rated for that total load." },
  { q: "How wide should a TV stand be for a 90 inch TV?", a: "Most 90 inch TVs measure between 78 and 80 inches wide edge to edge. A stand between 79 and 87 inches wide generally looks proportional and provides enough surface area for the TV base or wall-mount bracket clearance plus a soundbar in front." },
  { q: "What is the difference between sliding doors and hinged cabinet doors on a TV stand?", a: "Sliding doors move sideways within the frame and require no clearance in front of the stand to open, which works well in narrower living rooms. Hinged doors swing outward and need several inches of open floor space in front of the cabinet to fully open." },
  { q: "Do 90 inch TV stands include built-in power outlets?", a: "Some do. Several stands in this size range include a built-in power strip inside one cabinet compartment, typically offering 2 AC outlets and 2 USB ports, which lets a streaming device or router stay powered without a separate extension cord crossing the floor." },
