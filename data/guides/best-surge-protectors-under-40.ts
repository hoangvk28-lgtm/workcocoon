export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Flat Plug Design Solves a Specific, Real Furniture-Placement Problem a Standard Plug Creates",
    "explanation": "The TLP808B pick's flat plug specifically allows furniture and equipment to sit flush against a wall, while a standard bulkier plug protruding from the outlet forces furniture to sit at a gap from the wall to accommodate the plug's depth. This matters in smaller rooms where every inch of usable floor space counts, and it's a detail easy to overlook until you actually try to push a bed, desk, or dresser flush against a wall with a standard-plug device already installed. Check specifically for flat plug or low-profile plug language in a listing if your intended placement requires furniture sitting directly against the wall."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Documented Warranty Amounts Vary Dramatically Even Among Similarly Featured Picks at This Tier",
    "explanation": "The TLP808B pick's $75,000 connected equipment insurance is three times higher than the ECHOGEAR pick's $25,000 warranty, despite both offering comparable core surge protection functionality, demonstrating that warranty depth doesn't necessarily track with joule rating or even price directly. This matters because a documented, higher-dollar warranty provides more concrete financial protection if a surge somehow damages connected equipment despite the surge protector's efforts. Compare the specific stated warranty dollar amount across your shortlist rather than assuming similarly priced or featured picks offer comparable financial protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Highest Joule Rating in a Comparison Isn't Always the Pricier Option",
    "explanation": "The Amazon Basics pick offers the highest joule rating in this entire comparison at 4000 joules while also being the least expensive pick, demonstrating that joule rating and price don't move in lockstep, since the TLP808B and ECHOGEAR picks both cost more while offering lower joule ratings in exchange for other features like flat plug design or a higher documented warranty. This means chasing the highest joule number alone can actually lead you to the most affordable option rather than the priciest, depending on which specific pick you're comparing. Evaluate joule rating as an independent factor from price rather than assuming they scale together."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sliding or Built-In Safety Covers Provide Real Protection Value Beyond Basic Surge Suppression",
    "explanation": "Both the TLP808B's sliding safety covers and the ECHOGEAR's built-in safety covers specifically block unused outlets from accidental contact, a genuine child-safety and dust-prevention feature that a pick without this design, like the Amazon Basics or CyberPower picks, doesn't offer. This matters directly in households with young children or pets, where an exposed unused outlet presents an unnecessary risk regardless of how well the strip protects against electrical surges. Check specifically for safety covers on unused outlets if this is a genuine concern in your household."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual UL Verification (Certified and Listed) Represents a More Thorough Documentation Standard Than Either Term Alone",
    "explanation": "The TLP808B pick specifically states it is both UL Certified and UL Listed, two related but distinct forms of independent verification, while a pick citing only one of these terms may still be safe but offers less explicitly documented assurance. This distinction is a technical one that most buyers won't need to fully understand, but a listing that specifically names both certifications together signals a manufacturer investing in more comprehensive documented safety verification. Check whether a listing uses both terms together or just one when comparing safety documentation depth across similarly priced picks."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does a flat plug design affect how well the surge protector actually works?", "a": "No, a flat plug is purely a physical space-saving design choice that doesn't affect the surge protection circuitry's performance; the TLP808B's flat plug and 1440J rating function independently of each other." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing joule ratings at this price tier?", "a": "Assuming the highest joule rating always comes at the highest price, when the Amazon Basics pick actually offers the highest rating in this comparison at the lowest price, since joule rating and price don't necessarily scale together." },
  { "q": "Is the TLP808B worth the price premium over the Amazon Basics pick's higher joule rating?", "a": "If a flat plug design and the highest documented $75,000 connected equipment warranty matter to you, yes, but if raw joule protection capacity at the lowest price is your priority, the Amazon Basics pick's 4000J rating exceeds the TLP808B's 1440J at a lower cost." },
  { "q": "How much does EMI/RFI noise filtering on the CyberPower pick actually matter for a basic home office setup?", "a": "For general computing and office equipment without sensitive audio or video components, this filtering matters less, so a pick without it, like the Amazon Basics or TLP808B, would perform comparably for basic surge protection needs." },
  { "q": "Do sliding or built-in safety covers reduce a surge protector's usable outlet count?", "a": "No, these covers simply close over unused outlets and open easily when you need to plug something in, so they don't reduce your actual usable outlet count, they just add a layer of protection when outlets aren't in active use." },
  { "q": "Can I mount any of these surge protectors under a desk if I don't want them visible on the floor?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison include keyhole mounting slots or wall-mount compatible designs specifically supporting under-desk or wall installation, keeping the unit off the visible floor space." }
