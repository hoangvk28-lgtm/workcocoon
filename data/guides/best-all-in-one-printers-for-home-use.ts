export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand duty cycle as a maximum ceiling, not a healthy day-to-day volume",
    "explanation": "A printer's rated duty cycle is the absolute maximum number of pages it can print in a month before risking premature wear, not a figure representing comfortable, sustained daily use, printing consistently near that ceiling month after month accelerates wear on the print mechanism well beyond what the same printer would experience at a more moderate, realistic volume.\n\nThis matters because buying a printer rated just barely above your expected monthly volume often means running it closer to its stress limit than its comfortable operating range.\n\nCheck the listed duty cycle figure, and target a printer rated at 3 to 5 times your actual expected monthly volume for genuinely comfortable long-term use, not a printer rated just above what you think you'll print."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match multi-user wifi sharing to how many people will actually print from it",
    "explanation": "A printer's wireless sharing capability varies in real-world reliability between models, some handle multiple simultaneous connection requests from different devices smoothly, while others can drop connections or queue print jobs unreliably when more than one person tries to print around the same time.\n\nThis matters directly for a shared home office or household with multiple people printing throughout the day, less for a single dedicated user.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of multi-device wifi reliability, not just whether wireless printing is listed as a supported feature, since the feature existing and working reliably under real multi-user load aren't the same thing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check scan resolution against what you're actually digitizing, not just print quality",
    "explanation": "Print quality specs get most of the attention in printer listings, but scan resolution, measured in DPI, determines whether a scanned document stays genuinely readable when zoomed in or printed again later, and this spec is often buried or only briefly mentioned compared to print specs.\n\nThis matters more if you regularly scan contracts, receipts, or other documents where legibility of fine print matters, less if scanning is an occasional, low-stakes task.\n\nCheck the listed optical scan resolution in DPI specifically, not just the printer's overall feature list, if document scanning is a real part of your workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh whether legacy features like fax are worth paying for in a 2026 home office",
    "explanation": "Many home-office printers still bundle a fax feature as a holdover from an earlier era, adding to the printer's cost and complexity even though most home offices in 2026 will genuinely never use it, having largely moved to email and digital document sharing entirely.\n\nThis matters for value, paying for a feature you'll never touch is a real, if often overlooked, inefficiency when a fax-free model at a lower price covers the same core printing and scanning needs.\n\nCheck whether fax is a genuine requirement for your specific situation before treating its presence as a meaningful selling point, and consider a fax-free model if it isn't."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider ink versus toner cost per page for your actual print volume, not just the printer's price",
    "explanation": "An inkjet printer is typically cheaper to buy upfront but has a meaningfully higher cost per printed page than a laser printer using toner, a gap that adds up significantly over months of real use at moderate to high volume, while a laser printer costs more initially but can work out cheaper in total ownership cost if you print regularly.\n\nThis matters directly based on your actual expected volume, a low-volume occasional printer may never recoup a laser printer's higher upfront cost, while a high-volume home office likely will.\n\nCheck the manufacturer's stated or estimated cost-per-page for both ink and toner options, and weigh that against your realistic monthly print volume, not just the printer's sticker price."

    q: "Do I need a 4-in-1 all-in-one printer, or is 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 enough?",
    a: "Most home buyers only regularly use print and occasional scan, which makes a 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 like the HP DeskJet 4355 or Canon PIXMA TS4320 enough. Reserve a 4-in-1 with ADF and fax for households that scan multi-page documents often or genuinely still need fax.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an automatic document feeder worth paying extra for?",
    a: "Yes, if you regularly scan multi-page documents like tax returns, contracts, or old records. If your scanning is occasional and single-page, skip it and save $20-30 on a flatbed-only pick like the Canon PIXMA TS6520.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the flatbed or the ADF better for scanning photos?",
    a: "Always the flatbed. AIO flatbed scanners commonly run around 1200dpi resolution suitable for photos and fine detail, while ADF scanning is typically lower resolution, closer to 300dpi, and built for speed on text documents rather than image quality.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I buy an all-in-one or a separate scanner and printer?",
    a: "If scan quality matters more than convenience, a dedicated scanner paired with a basic printer like the HP DeskJet 4355 often beats an AIO's scan quality per dollar, since the AIO's scanner is a secondary feature rather than the main product. For balanced, moderate use, an AIO is simpler and usually sufficient.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I actually need the fax feature on an all-in-one printer?",
    a: "Almost certainly not in 2026 unless you deal with a business, medical office, or government agency that specifically requires fax. Skipping fax-equipped models saves money without giving up anything most households will ever use.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I scan documents directly to Google Drive or Dropbox?",
    a: "Most manufacturer apps, including HP Smart and Canon PRINT, support scan-to-cloud once you sign into your account within the app. Set this up right after unboxing so scanned receipts, contracts, or photos upload automatically instead of routing through your computer first.",
