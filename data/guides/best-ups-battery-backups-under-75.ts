export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Genuine Sine Wave Output Matters More for Certain Electronics Than a Simulated Sine Wave Provides",
    "explanation": "The Eaton Tripp Lite BC350 specifically delivers genuine sine wave output in both AC and battery mode, a cleaner power waveform than the simulated sine wave output on the CyberPower and APC picks in this comparison, which approximates a sine wave using stepped voltage rather than a true smooth curve. This distinction matters most for sensitive electronics like certain audio equipment or specific power supplies that can run less efficiently or generate more heat on simulated sine wave power. Check whether your specific connected equipment's manufacturer recommends genuine sine wave power before assuming simulated sine wave output is equally suitable for all devices."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Split Between Battery-Backup and Surge-Only Outlets Determines Which Devices Actually Stay Powered During an Outage",
    "explanation": "Every desktop UPS in this comparison splits its outlets between battery-backup-and-surge-protected outlets and surge-only outlets, meaning only the devices plugged into the battery-backup outlets continue running during an actual power outage, while devices in surge-only outlets simply lose power like a normal outlet but remain protected from surges during normal operation. Plugging a critical device like your router or modem into a surge-only outlet by mistake means it won't actually stay powered during an outage despite being connected to the UPS. Check which specific outlets are labeled battery-backup versus surge-only, and plug your most critical devices into the battery-backup outlets specifically."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Portable DC Battery Pack's Continuous Wattage Limit Is a Real Constraint, Not Just a Technical Footnote",
    "explanation": "The TalentCell pick explicitly states it cannot continuously power devices exceeding 37W, since exceeding this limit would drain the battery unusually quickly, a real practical constraint if you're considering it for a device with a higher continuous power draw than this limit allows. This differs fundamentally from a desktop UPS's wattage rating, which typically has more headroom for brief power spikes even if the continuous rated wattage is similar. Check both the peak and continuous wattage requirements of your specific device against a portable battery pack's stated limits before assuming it can handle your equipment's actual power draw."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A UPS's Runtime Rating Is Specific to a Stated Load Wattage, Not a Universal Number",
    "explanation": "The APC BE425M's stated 15 minutes of runtime specifically applies at a 100W load, meaning a lower-wattage device like a router drawing only 20W would actually run considerably longer on the same battery, while a higher-wattage device would drain the battery faster than the stated figure suggests. This matters because comparing runtime figures across different UPS units only makes sense if you're comparing at the same load wattage, and your actual device's power draw likely differs from the standard 100W test load manufacturers typically cite. Calculate your actual device's wattage draw and understand that stated runtime figures will scale accordingly, rather than treating the stated number as a fixed guarantee for any device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A UPS's User-Replaceable Battery Design Extends the Unit's Useful Life Well Beyond the Battery's Own Lifespan",
    "explanation": "UPS batteries typically degrade and need replacement after 3 to 5 years of regular use regardless of how well the rest of the unit performs, and a UPS designed with a user-replaceable battery lets you swap in a new battery and continue using the same unit rather than replacing the entire device once the original battery wears out. This matters for the long-term cost of ownership, since a UPS without easy battery replacement effectively becomes disposable once its battery degrades, even if the electronics inside remain fully functional. Check whether a listing specifically mentions user-replaceable battery design and the availability of a replacement battery model before assuming any UPS offers this long-term serviceability."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does simulated sine wave output on the CyberPower or APC picks actually cause problems for most electronics?", "a": "For most standard electronics like routers, lamps, and basic computers, simulated sine wave output works fine, and the distinction mainly matters for specific sensitive equipment where the manufacturer explicitly recommends genuine sine wave power." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when setting up a new UPS battery backup?", "a": "Plugging critical devices like a router or modem into the surge-only outlets by mistake, when only the battery-backup outlets actually keep those devices powered during an actual outage, not just protected from surges." },
  { "q": "Is the Eaton Tripp Lite BC350 worth the price premium over the CyberPower ST425?", "a": "If genuine sine wave output and the highest documented $100,000 connected equipment insurance matter to you, yes, but if you want the most total outlets at a lower price without needing genuine sine wave power, the CyberPower ST425 offers strong value instead." },
  { "q": "Can the TalentCell portable battery pack replace a desktop UPS for my computer setup?", "a": "No, it lacks AC outlets entirely and can't continuously power devices exceeding 37W, making it unsuitable for a desktop computer; it's specifically designed for lower-power DC devices like routers, cameras, and LED strips." },
  { "q": "How do I calculate how long my specific device will run on a UPS's battery?", "a": "Check your device's actual wattage draw (often listed on its power adapter or in its specifications) and compare it against the UPS's stated runtime at a reference load, understanding that a lower-wattage device will run longer than the stated figure and a higher-wattage device will run shorter." },
  { "q": "Can I replace the battery in these UPS units myself when it eventually wears out?", "a": "Check the specific product listing for user-replaceable battery language; several UPS units at this price and above are designed for easy battery swaps using a specific replacement battery model, extending the unit's useful life well beyond the original battery's lifespan." }
