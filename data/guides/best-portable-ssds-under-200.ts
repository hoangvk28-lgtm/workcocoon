At roughly $20 less than the SSK 1TB pick below, it undercuts a similarly specced competitor while keeping Sandisk's longer public track record.\n\nThe listing frames itself partly around AI-generated content storage, reflecting current buyer needs, but the core value proposition is the same as any 1TB SSD: fast, no-moving-parts storage in a pocket-sized body. Compared to the older Sandisk model at $182.90 also available in this price range, this new model offers the same or better specs for less, making the older listing worth avoiding if this newer one is in stock.\n\nBest for buyers who want a 1TB drive from an established brand at the best available price within that brand's own current lineup.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watch for a Brand's Own Older Model Being a Worse Deal",
    "explanation": "It's genuinely possible for the same brand to have two similarly named listings live at once, an older model and its replacement, where the older one is both slower and more expensive than the newer version, as this comparison found with two Sandisk 1TB listings. Amazon's search results don't always sort by which model is current, so check the exact model name, stated release context (\"new model\" versus no such label), and rated speed carefully before assuming a higher-ranked search result is the better choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Encryption Software Is a Genuine Differentiator, Not a Given",
    "explanation": "Built-in encryption software, like the 256-bit AES encryption on the Lexar pick in this comparison, protects files if the physical drive is lost or stolen, a real security benefit that most budget and mid-range portable SSDs simply don't include. If you're storing sensitive documents, financial records, or client data on a portable drive, check specifically for a named encryption feature rather than assuming any SSD offers this protection by default."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "1TB Speed Still Varies Meaningfully in This Price Band",
    "explanation": "Even among similarly priced 1TB drives, rated speed in this comparison ranges from 800MB/s up to 1050MB/s, roughly a 30 percent difference that matters for large file transfers like 4K video exports. Don't assume that landing in the same rough price range means landing in the same speed tier; check the specific rated MB/s figure for each 1TB option you're considering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Named Device Compatibility Beats General \"Works with iPhone\" Claims",
    "explanation": "Some listings specify exactly which device generations they support, like the Lexar pick explicitly confirming iPhone 17 while excluding iPhone 14 and older, rather than making a blanket compatibility claim. If you have an older device, a specific exclusion listed in the product details is far more useful and honest than a vague universal compatibility claim, and it's worth checking carefully before assuming your exact device model works."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Health Monitoring Features Aren't Automatically Included at Higher Prices",
    "explanation": "Paying more within this specific price band doesn't guarantee S.M.A.R.T. health diagnostics or TRIM support, some pricier picks in this comparison document these features explicitly while a cheaper one in the same lineup doesn't mention them at all. If tracking your drive's long-term health matters, look for the specific feature name in the listing rather than assuming price alone signals which drives include it."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How do I know if I'm buying the newer or older version of a drive when both show up in search?", "a": "Check the exact model name for labels like \"new model\" and compare the stated rated speed and price across listings that look similar. In this comparison, an older Sandisk 1TB listing was both slower and more expensive than the brand's own newer version, so don't assume a higher price or a top search position means the better or more current product." },
  { "q": "Is encrypted software worth paying extra for on a portable SSD?", "a": "If you store sensitive files, like financial documents or client data, on a portable drive, built-in encryption software provides real protection if the physical drive is ever lost or stolen. For general file transfer and backup without sensitive content, it's a nice-to-have rather than a necessity." },
  { "q": "Does a 1TB SSD at this price still need TRIM and S.M.A.R.T. support?", "a": "These features aren't strictly necessary for the drive to function, but they help maintain consistent performance and let you monitor the drive's health over time. Not every 1TB drive in this price range documents them, so check specifically if long-term reliability tracking matters to you." },
  { "q": "Will these 1TB drives work with my older iPhone?", "a": "Check the specific listing carefully. Some drives explicitly exclude older iPhone models, like the Lexar pick in this comparison which doesn't support iPhone 14 and older, while others may work more broadly. Don't assume a general \"works with iPhone\" claim covers your exact model without confirming." },
  { "q": "What's the real speed difference between 800MB/s and 1050MB/s in daily use?", "a": "For everyday documents and photos, the difference is barely noticeable. For large files like 4K video exports or big game installs, the faster drive can save meaningful time, roughly 20 to 30 percent faster on large sequential transfers, though real-world results depend on your computer's own port speed too." },
  { "q": "Should I buy from a less established brand if it offers a lower price at the same specs?", "a": "It can be a reasonable choice if the specs and documented features genuinely match, but an established brand's longer track record provides more confidence for buyers who've had reliability issues with unfamiliar brands before. Weigh this against how much the price difference actually matters to you." }
