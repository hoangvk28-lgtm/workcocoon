export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that most LCD writing tablets don't save what you write, and confirm before assuming otherwise",
    "explanation": "The core technology behind an LCD writing tablet uses pressure-sensitive liquid crystal layers that display a line wherever you press with the stylus, and a single button press clears the entire screen by resetting that pressure pattern, a fundamentally different mechanism from a digital note-taking device that stores what you write as data.\n\nThis means the overwhelming majority of these tablets have no way to save, export, or recover anything once erased, an important expectation to set correctly since the product category name (\"writing tablet\") sounds similar to genuinely different digital notebook devices that do save content.\n\nCheck specifically for the word \"memory\" paired with an actual save or export function, or explicit Bluetooth/app-sync language, rather than assuming any writing tablet preserves your notes, since a basic memory lock button only pauses erasing, it doesn't save content anywhere."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Don't assume kids' and adult marketing reflects a real functional difference",
    "explanation": "LCD writing tablets are sold under two distinct marketing approaches, bright, character-branded versions explicitly targeted at children with age-range callouts and educational framing, and plainer, neutral-colored versions marketed toward adults for office notes or quick sketches, but the underlying LCD writing and erase technology is frequently identical between the two at a similar screen size and price point.\n\nThis matters because a buyer specifically shopping for an adult-styled option can end up paying a premium for styling alone if a functionally identical kids' version is available at a lower price, and vice versa for a buyer who assumed the adult version had a more capable writing surface.\n\nCompare the actual specs (screen size, pressure sensitivity, included features) rather than the marketing angle, and don't assume the age-targeted framing correlates with any real technical difference in writing quality."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the battery type and replacement situation before buying",
    "explanation": "LCD writing tablets use one of two power approaches: a small replaceable coin-cell (button) battery that typically lasts many months of normal use and costs only a couple of dollars to replace when it eventually dies, or a sealed rechargeable battery built into the unit that can't be swapped out and, once it degrades or fails after repeated charge cycles, effectively ends the product's useful life since replacement isn't practical.\n\nThis is a genuinely different long-term ownership tradeoff that isn't always obvious from the listing photos alone, a rechargeable tablet avoids ever buying a replacement battery but has a real end-of-life point built in, while a replaceable-battery tablet can theoretically last indefinitely as long as coin cells remain available.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for battery type, and if a genuinely long product lifespan matters more than charging convenience, favor a replaceable coin-cell design."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the screen size accurately reflects the actual writing surface, not the overall unit dimensions",
    "explanation": "Some listings state a screen size in the product title that refers to the diagonal measurement of the entire unit including its bezel and button area, rather than the actual usable writing surface, which can mean a tablet marketed as a specific size delivers a meaningfully smaller writable area than that number suggests once the bezel is accounted for.\n\nThis matters most for buyers specifically comparing size tiers (deciding between an 8.5, 10, or 12 inch model, for example) since the real usable difference between two adjacent size tiers can be smaller than the headline numbers imply if one listing measures the full unit and another measures just the screen.\n\nCheck the listing's specific dimensions for the writing surface itself where stated, and treat the headline size number as a rough guide rather than an exact usable-area guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since this category includes many similar generic listings",
    "explanation": "The LCD writing tablet category on Amazon includes a large number of very similarly specified products from different, often unfamiliar brand names, frequently manufactured by the same underlying suppliers with different branding and packaging, which means review count and rating patterns can vary widely between listings that are functionally almost identical.\n\nA listing with a strong rating built on a large, genuine review base gives more confidence in real-world durability (a tablet that stops registering pressure correctly in certain screen areas is a common failure mode in this category) than a similar-looking listing with only a handful of reviews.\n\nWhen comparing two similarly priced and specified tablets, check both the star rating and the review count together, and treat an unusually thin review base as a reason for extra caution regardless of how complete the feature list looks."
