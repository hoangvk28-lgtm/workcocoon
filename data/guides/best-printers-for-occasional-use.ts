  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",

  {
    q: "What counts as occasional printer use?",
    a: "It varies widely, weekly, monthly, and quarterly printing each carry different ink-drying risk. Weekly use is close to regular use and any printer in this list handles it fine. Monthly use benefits from an occasional nozzle check. Quarterly or rarer use is where an inkless thermal printer or careful cartridge maintenance really matters.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does leaving my inkjet printer plugged in waste ink even when I'm not printing?",
    a: "Yes. Inkjet printers run periodic auto-clean and nozzle-check cycles even when idle, which consumes a measurable amount of ink over months. Fully unplugging the printer between uses, rather than leaving it in sleep mode, reduces this waste for an occasional user.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can toner expire before I use it all?",
    a: "Yes. Bundled toner commonly has a shelf life of around 2 years from manufacture. A very-low-volume laser printer user could see toner degrade or expire before finishing the cartridge, so check the manufacture date rather than assuming toner lasts indefinitely.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why would I want an inkless printer instead of a basic inkjet?",
    a: "If you print extremely rarely, once every few months or less, an inkless thermal printer like the MT610Pro sidesteps ink dry-out entirely since there's no ink involved. The tradeoff is higher per-page paper cost and lower long-term print durability compared to ink or toner on standard paper.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I expect quality issues on the first print after not using my printer for a while?",
    a: "For inkjet printers, yes, streaking or missing nozzle lines are common after weeks of idle time. Run a test page or nozzle check before anything important rather than trusting the first print to come out clean.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it worth buying an ink-tank printer if I only print occasionally?",
    a: "Usually not. Ink-tank printers only pay back their higher upfront price at real volume, hundreds of pages a month. For occasional use, a basic cartridge inkjet or the inkless thermal option in this list is almost always the more cost-effective choice.",
