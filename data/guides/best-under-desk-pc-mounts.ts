  "Rear-IO and cable access matters far more once the PC is actually mounted and in daily use than a mount's static weight rating ever reflects, worth checking whether a mount lets you reach the ports to plug in a new peripheral or troubleshoot a cable without fully unmounting the tower first, since under-desk placement also traps warm air near the floor with limited airflow compared to open desk-side placement.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh your loaded tower, not its size category",
    "explanation": "A mount's weight rating is a number on a spec sheet, and it's almost always tested against a generic mid-tower case with nothing installed, not the fully loaded tower you actually own once drives, a full-size power supply, and any add-in cards are factored in.\n\nThat gap matters because a case that looks like a standard mid-tower on the shelf can weigh well beyond a budget mount's rated capacity once it's actually built out, and an overloaded mount risks failing or sagging over time rather than failing outright on day one.\n\nBefore buying, weigh or estimate your tower's real loaded weight, and check the mount's listing for the exact tested capacity figure rather than trusting a vague phrase like \"heavy duty\" with no number attached."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the mounting method against your desk's construction",
    "explanation": "Under-desk mounts attach in one of two ways: screwed directly into the underside of the desk, or clamped on without any drilling.\n\nWhich one applies to you depends on whether you're allowed to drill into the desk at all, a real constraint for renters, office furniture, or a desk you don't want to damage, and clamp-on designs solve that but generally top out at a lower weight capacity than a screwed bracket.\n\nCheck the listing for the desk thickness range a clamp-on mount actually supports, since a desktop that's thicker or thinner than the clamp's rated range simply won't grip securely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plan rear-IO and cable access before you mount, not after",
    "explanation": "Once a tower is mounted under the desk, reaching the rear panel to plug in a new peripheral, swap a cable, or troubleshoot a connection becomes meaningfully harder than it was when the case sat in the open on the desk-side floor.\n\nThis is worth thinking through before installation, not after, because the fix at that point is usually a full unmount rather than a quick adjustment.\n\nDecide which direction the case's rear panel will face relative to where you sit, and favor a mount that lets you slide or swivel the tower out partway without fully removing it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Factor in the thermal tradeoff of under-desk placement",
    "explanation": "Moving a tower off the desktop and into the enclosed space under the desk changes its airflow environment, since that space traps warmer air near the floor with less open circulation than desk-side placement gets.\n\nThis tradeoff matters more for a build generating real heat, a discrete GPU or several drives under sustained load, and less for a lighter general-use machine that rarely pushes hard.\n\nCheck whether the mount design leaves open space around the case rather than boxing it in tightly, since that gap is what keeps the thermal impact manageable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the bracket adjustability matches your case dimensions",
    "explanation": "An adjustable mount uses sliding rails or an expandable frame so it can grip cases across a range of widths and heights, rather than fitting only one exact case size.\n\nThis matters because a fixed-size bracket that's a poor match for your tower either won't close securely around it or will grip with too much slack, and either failure mode risks the case shifting or dropping over time.\n\nCheck the listing for the actual adjustable range in inches, and measure your tower's width and depth against that range before assuming any mount labeled \"adjustable\" will automatically fit."
