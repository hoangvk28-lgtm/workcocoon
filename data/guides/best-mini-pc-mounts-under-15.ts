The listing is explicit that this plate alone doesn't complete the mount, since you still need the Intel NUC mounting bracket that shipped with your NUC to attach the device to this extension plate.\n\nInstallation takes only minutes with a screwdriver and included hardware, and the maker backs it with direct support if fit issues come up, a reassurance worth having given how many NUC generations and form factors exist.\n\nBest for buyers with an Intel NUC who already have its factory mounting bracket and just need the VESA extension piece.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A VESA Extension Plate and a Complete Mounting Bracket Solve Different Problems",
    "explanation": "The HumanCentric pick in this comparison is explicitly an extension plate only, meaning it requires your mini PC's original factory mounting bracket to actually attach the device, while the Bedycoon, IFCASE, and JINGCHENGMEI picks work as standalone solutions without that extra piece. Buying an extension-plate-only product without realizing you need a separate bracket is a common and avoidable mistake at this price tier. Read the listing's included-items section carefully, not just the compatible-devices list, before assuming any VESA mount is a complete kit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Exact Model Number Compatibility Matters More at This Price Than General Brand Matching",
    "explanation": "The Bedycoon bracket lists dozens of specific Intel NUC model numbers by generation, and this level of detail exists because NUC back hole spacing has changed across generations, meaning a bracket compatible with one NUC generation may not physically fit another despite both being labeled Intel NUC. The same logic applies to Dell OptiPlex Micro and Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny mounts, which specify exact supported model numbers rather than a general brand claim. Cross-reference your specific device's model number against a listing's compatibility list rather than assuming brand-level compatibility guarantees a physical fit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A VESA Port Already in Use by Your Monitor's Stand Requires a Specific Workaround Product",
    "explanation": "If your monitor's own stand uses its VESA mounting point, as most monitor stands do, you can't simply attach a standard VESA mini PC mount to the same spot without removing the monitor's stand entirely. The IFCASE extension plate in this comparison specifically addresses this scenario by working around an occupied VESA port rather than requiring a free one. Check whether your monitor's stand occupies its VESA mount before assuming any standard VESA mini PC bracket will work with your existing setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable Management Features Add Real Value at a Cost of Essentially Nothing",
    "explanation": "The Bedycoon bracket includes a cable strap specifically for organizing wire, a small addition that costs the manufacturer very little but genuinely reduces visible cable clutter once the mount is installed behind a monitor or under a desk. A mount without any cable management feature works identically for actually holding the device, but you'll be left improvising your own cable organization separately. This is a minor but real differentiator worth noting when two mounts are otherwise comparable in price and compatibility."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Color-Matched or Brand-Specific Hardware Signals More Careful Product Design",
    "explanation": "The JINGCHENGMEI mount includes a black hand screw for Dell OptiPlex units and a white hand screw for Lenovo ThinkCentre units, a detail that shows the manufacturer specifically designed the hardware kit around each brand's existing color scheme rather than shipping one generic screw for everything. While this doesn't affect the mount's functional performance, it's a small signal of attention to detail worth weighing when comparing otherwise similar budget options at this price tier."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need any tools beyond a screwdriver to install these mounts?", "a": "No, every pick in this comparison installs with basic hand tools, typically just a screwdriver, and all include the necessary screws in the box." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a mount at this price?", "a": "Buying an extension-plate-only product like the HumanCentric pick without realizing they still need their mini PC's original factory bracket, resulting in an incomplete mounting solution." },
  { "q": "Is the Bedycoon bracket worth it over the HumanCentric extension plate for an Intel NUC?", "a": "If you no longer have your NUC's original factory bracket, yes, the Bedycoon's all-in-one design eliminates that requirement, but if you already have the factory bracket, the HumanCentric plate is a perfectly functional and slightly cheaper option." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my monitor's VESA port is already occupied by its stand?", "a": "Check the back of your monitor where the four VESA screw holes are located; if your monitor's own stand or arm is currently screwed into that pattern, it's occupied, and you'd need a workaround solution like the IFCASE extension plate." },
  { "q": "Can I use the JINGCHENGMEI mount for a mini PC brand other than Dell or Lenovo?", "a": "No, it's specifically built for Dell OptiPlex Micro and Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny form factors, so a different brand's mini PC would need a differently sized or patterned mount instead." },
  { "q": "Do these mounts work if I want to switch from under-desk mounting to behind-monitor mounting later?", "a": "The JINGCHENGMEI, Bedycoon, and IFCASE picks all support multiple mounting scenarios using the same hardware, so switching locations later is possible without buying a new mount, though the HumanCentric plate specifically requires your NUC's factory bracket regardless of mounting location." }
