export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Mode Device's Actual Function Depends Entirely on Which Power Source You Connect to It",
    "explanation": "The MokerLink pick specifically functions as a PoE extender, a network extender, or a PoE switch depending on whether you supply standard PoE input, DC 12V, or DC 37-57V power, meaning the same physical device serves genuinely different roles based purely on its power source rather than a software or hardware configuration change. This matters if you want one device that can adapt to different roles as your network setup changes over time, and matters less if your PoE extension need is fixed and unlikely to change. Understand that a multi-mode device's listed capabilities require the correct matching power source for each specific mode, and factor in whether you already have or need to purchase that power source separately."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Shared Power Budget Across Two PoE Ports Means Combined Device Draw Matters More Than Each Port's Individual Rating",
    "explanation": "The BV-Tech pick specifically states its 2 PoE ports share a 30W total power budget rather than each port independently supporting up to 30W simultaneously, meaning the combined draw of both connected devices must stay within that shared 30W ceiling. This matters significantly if you're connecting two devices that each draw close to 15W or more, since exceeding the shared budget could result in one or both devices not receiving adequate power. Check whether a 3-port extender's power budget is shared across its outputs or independently allocated to each, and confirm your two devices' combined wattage stays within that actual shared limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dedicated Uplink Port Architecture Is Specifically Designed for Small Business Network Topology, Not Just Extra Connectivity",
    "explanation": "The BV-Tech pick's specifically described 1 dedicated uplink port plus 2 PoE ports architecture is built around a small business or workgroup network topology where the uplink connects back to a main switch or router while the PoE ports serve local devices, a more purposeful design than a generic port arrangement. This matters if you're deploying in a small business setting with an existing network topology this architecture matches, and matters less for a simple home installation where any port arrangement would work equally well. Consider whether a 3-port extender's specific port architecture (uplink plus PoE outputs, versus a simple 1-in-2-out repeater) matches your actual network topology before choosing based on port count alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Optional VLAN Isolation Toggle Provides Security Flexibility Without Forcing It as a Default Setting",
    "explanation": "The Ztyuav pick's specifically named One Key VLAN mode, controlled by a dipswitch, lets you enable port isolation only when you actually need that network security feature, rather than a fixed VLAN configuration that's always on or always off regardless of your specific installation's needs. This matters if your network security needs vary between different installations or change over time, and matters less if you have a consistent, unchanging security requirement across all your PoE extender deployments. Check whether a 3-port extender's VLAN or isolation feature is a fixed setting or a toggleable option if flexibility to enable or disable it as needed matters for your use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Longer Stated Warranty and Documented Support Commitment Provide Real Recourse for a Device Serving Two Connected Devices",
    "explanation": "The NICGIGA pick's specifically stated 1-year warranty, lifetime technical support, and unconditional 30-day return policy provide more comprehensive backing than a bare-minimum or unstated warranty on a similarly priced 3-port extender, which matters more here than on a single-port device since a failure affects two connected devices simultaneously rather than just one. This matters if you want assurance beyond the purchase price for a device supporting two devices' connectivity, and matters less if you're comfortable simply replacing an inexpensive unit without pursuing warranty support. Check a 3-port extender's specific warranty and support terms, especially since it affects two connected devices rather than one, before assuming any similarly priced unit offers the same backing."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can a 3-port PoE extender really function as three different devices depending on the power source?", "a": "The MokerLink pick specifically confirms this three-in-one design, functioning as a PoE extender, network extender, or PoE switch depending on whether you supply PoE input, DC 12V, or DC 37-57V power, so checking the specific power requirement for the mode you need is important before purchase." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 3-port PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming each PoE output port independently supports its full rated wattage simultaneously, when several 3-port extenders specifically share a single total power budget across both output ports combined." },
  { "q": "Is the MokerLink extender worth the higher price over the Ztyuav pick?", "a": "If you specifically want the flexibility to adapt the device between PoE extension, network extension, and PoE switch roles, the MokerLink's higher price is justified, but for a simple, unchanging two-device extension need, the Ztyuav pick's much lower price is likely the better fit." },
  { "q": "Do I need the BV-Tech's dedicated uplink port for a home installation?", "a": "The dedicated uplink port architecture is specifically designed for small business network topology, so for a simple home installation, a straightforward 1-in-2-out extender like the NICGIGA or Ztyuav picks may be a more appropriately matched and simpler choice." },
  { "q": "Does the VLAN isolation feature on the Ztyuav pick need to be enabled by default?", "a": "No, the One Key VLAN mode is specifically controlled by a dipswitch, letting you enable or disable port isolation as needed rather than forcing it as an always-on or always-off default setting." },
  { "q": "Can I power two devices with different wattage needs from the same 3-port extender?", "a": "Yes, but you should check whether the extender's power budget is shared or independent per port; the BV-Tech pick specifically shares a 30W total budget across both PoE ports, so the combined draw of your two devices needs to stay within that shared limit." }
