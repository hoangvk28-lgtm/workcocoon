export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "The Full 80Gbps Figure Only Materializes With a Genuine Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 v2 Host Port",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically require a Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 v2 host connection to unlock their full 80Gbps bandwidth, meaning connecting any of these docks to an older Thunderbolt 3 or 4 laptop will result in meaningfully reduced performance despite the dock's own hardware being fully capable. This matters significantly if you're shopping based on the headline 80Gbps figure without confirming your own laptop's exact port generation, and matters less if you've already verified your laptop specifically has Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 v2. Check your specific laptop's exact port generation before assuming any 80Gbps-rated dock will deliver that full bandwidth on your particular hardware."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Display Bandwidth Can Dynamically Scale Above the Base Data Bandwidth Figure",
    "explanation": "The OWC pick specifically states its 80Gb/s bi-directional data speed can scale up to 120Gb/s specifically for higher display bandwidth needs, illustrating that a dock's total bandwidth isn't a single fixed number but a pool that gets dynamically reallocated based on whether you're transferring data or driving demanding displays. This matters if you're running high-refresh or high-resolution displays that benefit from this dynamic reallocation, and matters less if your display needs are modest and you primarily use the dock for data transfer and storage. Understand that a dock's stated maximum bandwidth may represent a dynamically allocated ceiling rather than a fixed simultaneous figure across every use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "eGPU Enclosures Have Real GPU Brand and Chip Compatibility Exclusions That Vary by Operating System",
    "explanation": "The TREBLEET pick's listing explicitly states that on macOS, it only supports Intel-based Macs with specific named AMD GPU models (RX 470/590, Vega, Navi 5000 series) and explicitly does not support NVIDIA GPUs or Bootcamp on macOS, a real and specific compatibility boundary that could easily be missed if you assume broad 'Mac compatible' branding covers any GPU. This matters significantly if you're planning a Mac-based eGPU setup with a specific graphics card in mind, where checking this exact compatibility list against your chosen GPU is essential, and matters less if you're building a Windows-based eGPU setup where compatibility is broader. Check an eGPU enclosure's specific stated GPU brand, chip model, and operating system compatibility exclusions before purchasing your graphics card, not after."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-in High-Speed SSD Slot Serves a Genuinely Different Purpose Than General Port Expansion",
    "explanation": "The WAVLINK pick's PCIe Gen 4 x4 M.2 SSD slot, rated up to 64Gbps, is specifically marketed for caching high-bitrate RAW video footage directly within the dock, letting creators work smoothly without an external drive enclosure, a fundamentally different value proposition than the OWC pick's pure connectivity-focused design with no storage slot at all. This matters if your workflow genuinely involves large RAW files, project caching, or similar storage-intensive tasks, where built-in fast storage solves a real bottleneck, and matters less if you only need port expansion for displays and peripherals without heavy storage demands. Consider whether your specific workflow benefits from built-in high-speed local storage before choosing a dock based on connectivity features alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Full 80Gbps Figure on a Mac mini Dock Often Depends on the Exact Chip Tier, Not Just the Mac mini Model",
    "explanation": "The Mac mini Dock & Stand pick specifically states its single USB-C port delivers 80Gbps for the Mac mini M4 Pro but only 40Gbps for the standard Mac mini M4, a real difference determined by the exact chip tier rather than the Mac mini model name alone. This matters directly if you own the base M4 Mac mini and are shopping based on this dock's headline 80Gbps figure, where you'd actually receive half that bandwidth, and matters less if you specifically own the M4 Pro tier where the full figure applies. Check a dock's specifically stated bandwidth by exact chip tier (not just the general model name) before assuming the headline bandwidth figure applies to your specific Mac mini configuration."

  { "q": "Will I get 80Gbps bandwidth if my laptop only has Thunderbolt 4?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison specifically require a Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 v2 host connection to unlock the full 80Gbps bandwidth, so a Thunderbolt 4 laptop will see reduced performance despite the dock's own capability." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an 80Gbps USB4 dock?", "a": "Buying based purely on the headline 80Gbps figure without confirming their own laptop has a genuine Thunderbolt 5 or USB4 v2 port, then being disappointed when the dock performs at a lower, Thunderbolt 4-equivalent speed instead." },
  { "q": "Can I use the TREBLEET eGPU enclosure with an NVIDIA graphics card on my MacBook?", "a": "No, the listing explicitly states that on macOS, it only supports Intel-based Macs with specific AMD GPU models and does not support NVIDIA GPUs, so Mac users with NVIDIA cards should look elsewhere, though Windows users can use either NVIDIA or AMD GPUs." },
  { "q": "Is the WAVLINK dock's built-in SSD slot worth it if I don't do video editing?", "a": "If you don't have a specific need for local high-speed storage caching, the OWC Hub's lower price and pure connectivity focus may better suit your needs, while the WAVLINK's SSD slot delivers real value specifically for video editing, large file caching, or similar storage-intensive workflows." },
  { "q": "Will the Mac mini Dock & Stand give me 80Gbps if I own the base Mac mini M4 instead of the M4 Pro?", "a": "No, the listing specifically states the base Mac mini M4 gets 40Gbps transfer speeds, while the full 80Gbps figure is specifically reserved for the Mac mini M4 Pro chip tier." },
  { "q": "Do these docks require a separate power adapter, or is one included?", "a": "The OWC and TREBLEET picks specifically include their power supply built into the unit or in the box, while checking each specific listing's included accessories is worth doing since the WAVLINK pick's listing notes that cables and the security lock are not included." }
