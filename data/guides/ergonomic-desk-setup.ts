    question: "What is the correct ergonomic desk setup?",

      "The correct setup follows five positions: (1) monitor top at eye level, (2) screen 20--28 inches away, (3) chair adjusted so elbows are at 90° with thighs parallel to the floor, (4) keyboard and mouse at elbow height with wrists neutral, and (5) feet flat on the floor or a footrest. The most common mistake is adjusting the chair to match the desk instead of the other way around.",
  },
  {
    question: "How high should my monitor be for ergonomics?",
    answer:
      "The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level -- about 1 to 2 inches below. Your eyes naturally rest looking slightly downward (around 15°), so placing the screen top exactly at eye level is correct. To measure: sit in your normal working position, look straight ahead, and note where your eye line hits the monitor. If it lands below the top third, the monitor needs to go up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have an ergonomic setup without an ergonomic chair?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A dedicated ergonomic chair helps but is not the first priority. A memory foam footrest ($30--40) fixes the most common seated posture issue -- dangling feet. A lumbar cushion ($20--30) supports the lower back on a flat chair. Combined with a correctly positioned monitor, these two additions address roughly 80% of the ergonomic problems caused by poor seating.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best ergonomic desk setup for a small desk?",
    answer:
      "For small desks, prioritize: (1) a foldable laptop stand or monitor riser with storage to gain height without bulk, (2) a footrest that slides under the desk, and (3) a monitor light bar instead of a base lamp to eliminate desk footprint. A laptop stand plus external keyboard is the most space-efficient ergonomic combo for narrow desks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I set up an ergonomic desk with two monitors?",
    answer:
      "Place the primary monitor directly in front of you at eye level. Position the secondary monitor 30° to the side so you turn your head slightly -- not your whole body. If you use both monitors equally throughout the day, center them and meet them at the midpoint of your natural gaze. Avoid placing both monitors directly ahead side by side, which forces constant lateral neck movement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a bad desk setup cause carpal tunnel syndrome?",
    answer:
      "A bad setup does not directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, but sustained wrist extension -- wrists bent upward while typing -- is a recognized risk factor. If your keyboard sits on top of a high desk and you type with bent wrists for several hours daily, that sustained pressure on the median nerve contributes to cumulative strain over months and years. Keeping wrists neutral while typing and using a wrist rest only during breaks (not while actively typing) significantly reduces that risk.",
