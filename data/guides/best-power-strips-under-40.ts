export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Smart Home Ecosystem Compatibility Should Match Your Existing Devices, Not Just Offer the Most Features",
    "explanation": "The Amazon Basics smart strip works with Alexa only, while the BN LINK pick supports both Alexa and Google Assistant, a genuinely broader compatibility range that matters specifically if your household already uses a mix of both ecosystems or Google Home devices exclusively. Buying an Alexa-only strip when your home is built around Google Home means you won't get voice control functionality at all, regardless of how many other smart features the strip offers. Check your existing smart home device ecosystem before choosing a strip, since ecosystem mismatch renders the smart features effectively unusable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Genuine Aluminum Alloy Construction Provides Real Durability Advantages Over Standard Plastic Housing in Demanding Environments",
    "explanation": "The CRST 8-Outlet pick's 1.5mm extra-thick aluminum alloy housing is specifically engineered to be impact-resistant and fireproof, a meaningful durability upgrade over standard plastic power strip housing when used in a garage, workshop, or industrial setting where dropped tools, dust, or temperature extremes are common risks. A plastic-housed smart strip like the Amazon Basics or BN LINK picks isn't necessarily fragile, but it's not built to withstand the same physical abuse a workshop environment can subject equipment to. Match the housing material to your actual use environment rather than assuming any power strip handles a garage or workshop setting equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Individual Switches on a Heavy-Duty Strip Serve a Different Purpose Than Smart App Control",
    "explanation": "The CRST 8-Outlet pick's 8 individual physical switches let you instantly cut power to a specific tool or device with a simple flick, without needing a phone, an app, or an internet connection, a genuine advantage in a workshop where you want immediate, reliable control without any digital dependency. The smart strips in this comparison offer similar per-outlet control but require your phone and a working WiFi connection to access, which can be less convenient in a workshop setting where you might have dirty or gloved hands. Consider whether physical switches or app-based control better suits your actual working environment and habits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wide Outlet Spacing on a Metal Power Strip Solves the Same Problem It Does on a Standard Strip, But at a Higher Stakes Level",
    "explanation": "The CRST 8-Outlet pick's 1.77 inch outlet spacing specifically accommodates bulky transformer bricks and large power adapters common in workshop and industrial equipment, a genuinely wider spacing than the standard 1.5-inch spacing found on typical consumer power strips. In a workshop context, being unable to plug in all your equipment simultaneously due to outlet blocking is a more disruptive problem than it might be for home office use, since workshop tools often have larger, bulkier power connectors. Check the specific outlet spacing dimension for any heavy-duty strip you're considering for workshop use, not just the total outlet count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 2.4GHz-Only WiFi Requirement Is a Real Compatibility Constraint Worth Checking Before Purchase",
    "explanation": "The BN LINK smart strip specifically requires a 2.4GHz WiFi network and explicitly does not support 5GHz networks, a common limitation among budget smart home devices that can cause setup frustration if your home router broadcasts primarily on 5GHz or uses a combined network name without separating the two bands. This isn't a flaw unique to this product, but it's a genuine technical requirement that can block successful setup if not addressed beforehand. Check your router's WiFi band settings and ensure a discoverable 2.4GHz network exists before purchasing any smart home device with this stated requirement."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the Amazon Basics smart strip work with Google Home instead of Alexa?", "a": "No, it's specifically designed to work with Alexa only, so if your smart home setup is built around Google Home, the BN LINK pick, which supports both ecosystems, would be the better choice." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a power strip for a workshop or garage?", "a": "Choosing a standard plastic-housed strip, even a smart one, over a genuinely metal-housed pick like the CRST options, when a workshop environment's dust, impact, and temperature risks call for the more durable aluminum alloy construction." },
  { "q": "Is the CRST 8-Outlet Metal pick worth it over the cheaper 10-Outlet CRST pick?", "a": "If you specifically want individual switches for each outlet, yes, but if you just need more total outlets and a longer cord without per-outlet switching, the 10-Outlet pick's higher 2800J surge rating and 15-foot cord offer strong value at a lower price." },
  { "q": "Do I need a smart home hub to use the Amazon Basics or BN LINK smart strips?", "a": "No, both are specifically designed to work without a separate hub, connecting directly to your home WiFi network and the respective Alexa or Google Home app for control." },
  { "q": "Why does the BN LINK strip only work with 2.4GHz WiFi and not 5GHz?", "a": "This is a common limitation among budget smart home devices due to the chip technology used, so check your router's settings to ensure a 2.4GHz network is available and discoverable before setup." },
  { "q": "Can I use the heavy-duty CRST strips for regular home office equipment, or are they overkill?", "a": "They work fine for home office equipment, though their industrial-grade metal housing and wide outlet spacing are genuinely built for garage, workshop, or lab environments, so a standard plastic strip may be a more cost-effective choice if you don't need that level of physical durability." }
