export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB Phone Tethering Support Is Not Universal Across Every Travel Router and Should Be Explicitly Confirmed",
    "explanation": "Some travel routers focus primarily on converting existing Wi-Fi or Ethernet connections into a private network without clearly stating USB tethering capability, while others, like every pick in this comparison, explicitly name USB phone tethering as one of their supported connection modes. This matters significantly if your primary or backup internet source while traveling is your phone's cellular data plan rather than hotel Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and matters less if you always have access to an existing network to connect to instead. Check a travel router's listing specifically for the words 'USB tethering' or 'phone tethering' rather than assuming any router marketed for travel automatically supports this connection method."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Your Phone's Actual Cellular Data Speed, Not the Router's Wi-Fi Ceiling, Determines Real Tethered Connection Performance",
    "explanation": "A router's stated Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 7 speed ceiling reflects the maximum wireless speed it can broadcast to your other devices, but when tethering from a phone's cellular connection, your actual internet speed is capped by your phone's cellular signal and data plan, meaning a lower-tier router like the Roam 6 AX1500 delivers essentially the same real-world tethered performance as the pricier Roam 7 in most cases. This matters for avoiding overspending on Wi-Fi speed capability your cellular connection can't actually take advantage of, and matters less if you also plan to use the same router with faster Wi-Fi or Ethernet sources at other times. Consider your phone's typical cellular data speed realistically before assuming a higher-tier router's Wi-Fi ceiling translates to a faster tethered connection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm Your Cellular Carrier's Data Plan Actually Permits Tethering Without Additional Fees or Data Caps",
    "explanation": "Many cellular data plans either charge an additional fee for tethering, cap tethered data usage separately from regular phone data usage, or throttle tethered data speeds after a certain threshold, meaning the router's own capability isn't the only factor determining whether tethering works well for your travel needs. This matters significantly before relying on tethering as your primary connectivity method for an extended trip, and matters less for occasional, light tethering use where any plan-level restrictions are unlikely to matter. Check your specific cellular plan's tethering terms and any associated data caps before planning around USB tethering as your main travel internet source."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Simultaneous Device Count Matters More for Group Travel Than for Solo Tethering Use",
    "explanation": "A router supporting up to 90 devices, like the Roam 7, provides real headroom if you're tethering internet for a group, like a family or travel team sharing one phone's cellular connection across multiple laptops and phones, while a lower device-count router is perfectly sufficient for a single traveler tethering for just their own devices. This matters significantly for group travel scenarios pooling one cellular connection, and matters much less for solo travel where you're the only one connecting. Match a router's stated maximum device count to your actual expected number of simultaneous connections rather than assuming a higher number always matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "OpenWrt Customization Adds Real Value to Tethering Specifically if You Want VPN Routing Control Over Cellular Traffic",
    "explanation": "A router with OpenWrt and features like a VPN kill switch or per-site routing policies, as the GL.iNet pick offers, lets you apply the same granular traffic control to a tethered cellular connection as you would to a Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection, ensuring sensitive traffic always routes through the VPN even over an improvised phone-tethered setup. This matters more for business travelers handling sensitive data over an ad hoc tethered connection, and matters less for casual tethering used only occasionally as a backup connectivity option. Consider an OpenWrt-based option specifically if you want the same VPN routing control over tethered traffic as you'd apply to a standard network connection."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does every travel router support USB phone tethering?", "a": "No, this capability varies by model, so check the listing specifically for stated tethering support rather than assuming any travel router automatically works this way." },
  { "q": "Will tethering through a travel router drain my phone's battery faster?", "a": "USB tethering typically charges your phone while transferring data since it's connected via a USB cable, unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi hotspot tethering which draws down your phone's battery without a physical connection." },
  { "q": "Does my cellular carrier need to approve tethering for it to work?", "a": "Some carriers restrict or charge extra for tethering under their specific data plan terms, so check your plan's tethering allowance and any associated data caps before relying on it while traveling." },
  { "q": "Is a Wi-Fi 7 travel router necessary for phone tethering?", "a": "No, since your phone's cellular data speed, not the router's Wi-Fi ceiling, determines your real tethered connection speed, a lower-tier Wi-Fi 6 router often performs just as well for tethering specifically." },
  { "q": "Can multiple people share one phone's tethered connection through a travel router?", "a": "Yes, a travel router broadcasts the tethered connection as its own Wi-Fi network, letting multiple nearby devices connect simultaneously, though your phone's actual cellular data plan still governs total usage and speed." },
  { "q": "What's the advantage of OpenWrt for phone tethering specifically?", "a": "OpenWrt lets you apply the same VPN routing policies and kill switch protections to tethered cellular traffic as you would to a standard Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection, useful for business travelers handling sensitive data over an improvised tethered setup." }
