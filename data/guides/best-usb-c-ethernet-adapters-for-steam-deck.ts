  "We covered both dedicated gaming-handheld docks (JSAUX, UGREEN, Anker) built specifically around Steam Deck's charging and display needs, and general-purpose USB-C Ethernet adapters that work fine on Steam Deck's Linux-based SteamOS without being marketed as gaming products."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C is a connector, not a speed",
    "explanation": "A USB-C port can carry anywhere from 1Gbps to 10Gbps of Ethernet depending on the adapter's chipset and your host's actual USB generation. Check the exact Ethernet speed and required USB mode before assuming any USB-C adapter matches your needs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speeds need a fast enough USB port",
    "explanation": "A 2.5G, 5G, or 10G adapter plugged into a basic USB 3.0 (5Gbps) port will not reach its rated Ethernet speed. 2.5G generally works on 5Gbps ports; 5G and 10G typically need a USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10Gbps) port or Thunderbolt/USB4 host."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check OS and driver requirements before buying",
    "explanation": "Most Gigabit adapters are driver-free on Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS, but multi-gig adapters often need a manufacturer driver on Windows or specific Linux kernel versions, and some models exclude older Apple silicon chips entirely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your specific device isn't excluded",
    "explanation": "Several adapters in this cluster explicitly do not work with Nintendo Switch, Android, or specific Mac chip generations. Read the compatibility list carefully rather than assuming a USB-C connector guarantees your device will work."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A CAT6 cable matters as much as the adapter",
    "explanation": "Even a genuine Gigabit-capable adapter will fall back to slower speeds over an old CAT5 cable. Use CAT6 or better for Gigabit, and CAT6A for 5G/10G speeds, to actually realize the adapter's rated performance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PD passthrough wattage isn't automatically usable",
    "explanation": "An adapter rated for 100W or 140W Power Delivery passthrough only delivers that much power if you also supply a charger and cable rated for it. The adapter's rating is a ceiling, not a guarantee, without the matching charger."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does Steam Deck need a special Ethernet adapter, or will any USB-C one work?",
    "a": "SteamOS is Linux-based, so any USB-C Ethernet adapter with solid Linux driver support (like UGREEN's or Cable Matters' models) generally works fine. Dedicated Steam Deck docks add gaming-specific extras like HDMI output and higher-wattage charging tuned for the handheld's power draw."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why do some docks not support ROG Xbox Ally?",
    "a": "It comes down to how each dock's chipset negotiates power delivery and video output with that specific handheld's hardware. JSAUX and UGREEN both explicitly flag ROG Xbox Ally/Xbox Ally X as unsupported, even though they support Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Legion Go."
