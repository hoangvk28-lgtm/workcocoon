  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "Is an ink-tank printer worth the extra upfront cost for homeschooling?",
    a: "Usually, yes, if your monthly volume is in the hundreds of pages. The Epson EcoTank ET-2400 and HP Smart Tank 5101 cost more upfront than a basic cartridge inkjet, but bottle refills at $15 to $20 typically last months even at high volume, versus $30 to $60 a month in cartridges at that same volume. Most homeschool households recover the price difference within a single school year.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do about wall charts, posters, or maps my curriculum requires?",
    a: "None of the compact printers built for a homeschool desk handle A3 or 11x17 large-format printing. For occasional large-format needs, using a local print shop is typically cheaper and more practical than buying a dedicated large-format printer that would otherwise sit unused most of the year.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my printer's ink dry out over summer break?",
    a: "It can, for cartridge-based printers. Cartridges left idle for a few weeks or months can dry out, leading to wasted ink on auto-cleaning cycles when you resume printing in the fall. Ink-tank printers like the EcoTank ET-2400 or Smart Tank 5101 largely avoid this cost since bottle-fed ink doesn't dry out inside the printhead the way small cartridges do.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which printer is best for scanning completed worksheets in bulk?",
    a: "Look for an automatic document feeder, which lets you scan a stack of pages in one pass instead of feeding them one at a time. The Canon PIXMA TR4720 and Epson Workforce WF-2930 both include one, making them the better picks in this list for parents who regularly scan multi-page assignments or grading records.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a printer with fax for homeschooling?",
    a: "Almost never. Fax is a legacy feature that shows up on a few all-in-ones in this list, including the PIXMA TR4720 and Workforce WF-2930, but it rarely gets used in a homeschool context. Don't let fax sway your decision, focus on cost per page, automatic document feeder support, and color needs instead.",
