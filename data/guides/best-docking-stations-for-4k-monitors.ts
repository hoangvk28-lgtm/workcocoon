export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Why does my \"4K dock\" look blurry during video or fast mouse movement?",
    a: "It's likely running at 4K@30Hz rather than 60Hz, common on budget docks using an HDMI 1.4 connection. 30Hz causes visible motion blur in video and even ordinary cursor movement, while a true 4K@60Hz connection, which requires HDMI 2.0 or enough Thunderbolt or DisplayLink bandwidth, looks smooth.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much bandwidth do I need for dual 4K@60Hz?",
    a: "Roughly 30Gbps. Thunderbolt 4's 40Gbps total covers it with about 10Gbps left over for data, which is adequate but tight, while USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 at only 10Gbps total cannot drive dual 4K@60Hz natively. DisplayLink-based docks work around this limitation with their own compression technology.",
  },
  {
    q: "My dock supports HDMI 2.0, why doesn't HDR10 look right?",
    a: "4K HDR10 needs HDMI 2.0b or DisplayPort 1.4 at minimum. Plain HDMI 2.0, without the \"b\" revision, supports 4K@60Hz for standard dynamic range but cannot pass an HDR10 signal correctly, even though the resolution and refresh rate both look fine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the monitor matter as much as the dock for 4K@60Hz?",
    a: "Yes. A dock's output and the monitor's own input both need to support the target resolution and refresh rate, and the weaker of the two always wins. Check your monitor's actual HDMI or DisplayPort version, not just the dock's spec sheet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do DisplayLink docks work as well as Thunderbolt docks for 4K?",
    a: "For office and document work, yes, DisplayLink-based docks like the WAVLINK picks in this list reach true 4K@60Hz on dual displays. They add a small amount of input lag from CPU-based compression, though, which is more noticeable in fast-motion video editing or gaming than in everyday multitasking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is 4K@60Hz different on a Mac than on Windows?",
    a: "Yes. macOS defaults to 2x HiDPI scaling at 4K, which needs more from the GPU, and a DisplayLink-based dock can't fully replicate macOS's native HiDPI scaling, sometimes looking slightly less sharp than a native Thunderbolt connection. If image sharpness matters most on a Mac, a Thunderbolt-certified dock is the safer choice.",
