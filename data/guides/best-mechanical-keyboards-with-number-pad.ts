      "The RisoPhy is a genuine 104-key full-size board, so the numpad is not an afterthought bolted onto a smaller layout. Blue switches give it an audibly clicky feel, which is worth knowing if you plan to use the numpad in a shared office or on video calls. An ultra-slim ABS keycap profile keeps the overall footprint low, and spill resistance plus anti-ghosting are useful basics at this price. It is the pick for buyers who want a real numpad without spending close competitively on it. 104-key layout confirmed, not a marketing approximation.

  {
    "criterion": "Match switch type to your actual environment, not just gaming feel",
    "explanation": "Switch type determines feel, sound, and how disruptive the keyboard is to people around you, clicky switches feel satisfying to type on solo but produce an audible click on every keystroke that can be genuinely disruptive on a Zoom call or in a shared office, while linear switches are quieter and smoother, and tactile switches split the difference with a felt bump but no click.\n\nThis matters directly based on where you'll actually use the keyboard, a home office with video calls or a shared workspace calls for a different switch than a private gaming setup where clicky feedback is a feature, not a liability.\n\nCheck the specific switch name (not just \"mechanical\") and look up its actuation force and whether it's linear, tactile, or clicky before assuming any mechanical keyboard suits your environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check hot-swappable sockets if you want to change switches later without soldering",
    "explanation": "A hot-swappable keyboard lets you physically remove and replace individual switches without any soldering, meaning you can try different switch types or replace a failed switch years later without needing to be a hobbyist with a soldering iron.\n\nThis matters directly if you're not fully certain which switch feel you'll prefer long-term, or if you want the option to upgrade switches later without replacing the whole keyboard.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for \"hot-swappable\" and the specific socket type (3-pin or 5-pin) it supports, since not every hot-swap socket accepts every switch type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider keycap material for both feel and long-term durability",
    "explanation": "Keycap material affects both the tactile feel under your fingers and how well the keycaps resist shine and wear over years of typing, PBT plastic is generally more durable and resists the glossy shine that ABS plastic keycaps develop after months of oil and friction from typing.\n\nThis matters more for a keyboard you'll type on daily for years, less for occasional or gaming-only use where keycap longevity matters less.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for PBT versus ABS keycap material, since this detail is sometimes buried in the specs rather than featured prominently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh wireless convenience against connection latency for your actual use case",
    "explanation": "A wireless mechanical keyboard eliminates a desk cable but introduces a small amount of input latency compared to a wired connection, and Bluetooth in particular can have more noticeable latency than a dedicated 2.4GHz USB receiver, a real consideration for competitive gaming but largely unnoticeable for typing and general office work.\n\nThis matters more if you're specifically buying for fast-paced gaming, less for typing-focused office or home use where the latency difference is imperceptible.\n\nCheck whether a wireless keyboard supports a low-latency 2.4GHz dongle in addition to Bluetooth, and consider a wired connection specifically if competitive gaming performance matters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match keyboard layout and size to your actual desk space and workflow",
    "explanation": "Mechanical keyboards range from full-size boards with a number pad to compact tenkeyless (no number pad) and even smaller 60% layouts that omit the function row and arrow keys, and this size choice is a real tradeoff between desk space saved and keys available without a modifier combination.\n\nThis matters directly if you regularly use a number pad for data entry, a compact layout without one adds real friction, while someone who never touches the number pad gains meaningful desk space and a shorter reach to the mouse with a smaller layout.\n\nCheck the specific layout size and key count against your actual daily workflow, not just desk space alone."

  {
    q: "How do I know if a mechanical keyboard actually has a number pad?",
    a: "Check the confirmed key count in the listing, not just the word \"full-size\" in the title. A genuine full-size board is 104 keys, and some boards like the Redragon K668 add a few more for extra hotkeys at 108 keys. Anything under 100 keys, including tenkeyless (87-88 keys) or 75 percent boards, does not include a numpad.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a numpad make my mouse harder to reach?",
    a: "Yes. A full-size numpad adds roughly 4 inches of width compared to a tenkeyless board, which pushes your mouse hand 15-20cm further right and can cause repeated reaching discomfort over long sessions. If you only use the numpad occasionally, a tenkeyless board paired with a separate standalone numpad keeps your mouse closer most of the time while still giving you numpad access when needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What switch type is best for numpad-heavy work like data entry?",
    a: "Linear switches, like the Red switch on the Redragon K668 or the Banana switch on the Keychron V6 Max, have no tactile bump, which suits fast, repeated numeric entry better than a tactile or clicky switch. Tactile Brown switches give more feedback per press if you prefer confirmation you struck the key, and clicky Blue switches are the loudest option, best avoided in shared spaces.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do some full-size keyboards sound worse than tenkeyless ones at the same price?",
    a: "A full-size board has more large stabilized keys than a tenkeyless board, including the numpad's 0 key, Enter, and Plus keys, on top of the spacebar. A budget full-size board with poor-quality stabilizers will produce more rattle overall than a budget tenkeyless board, so stabilizer quality affects sound as much as the switch type itself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a wireless full-size keyboard worth it over a wired one?",
    a: "Wireless removes cable clutter, but a full-size wireless board has more keys and typically more RGB draw than a tenkeyless wireless board, which shortens battery life between charges. If you want the numpad without managing a battery, a wired option like the RisoPhy or Redragon K668 removes that variable entirely.",
