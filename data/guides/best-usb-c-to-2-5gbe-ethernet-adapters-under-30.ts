export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Check the actual chipset, not just the speed claim",
    explanation: "The chipset inside a USB-C ethernet adapter is what your operating system actually talks to, and it determines whether the adapter works instantly with no extra software or needs a manual driver install. Nearly every adapter in this price tier uses Realtek's RTL8156BG chip, which has mature native driver support in Windows, macOS, and most Linux kernels, but a listing that never names its chipset at all is a signal the manufacturer is hiding a cheaper, less-supported chip behind a generic \"2.5G\" label. Look for the chipset name and model number spelled out in the bullet points or product description, not just a headline speed number, and be skeptical of listings that only say \"advanced chipset\" without naming it."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Confirm your router or switch actually supports 2.5GbE",
    explanation: "An adapter rated for 2.5Gbps only delivers that speed if the device on the other end of the cable, your router, switch, or NAS, also supports 2.5GbE. Most home routers shipped before 2023 top out at 1Gbps per port, which means a 2.5GbE adapter plugged into a standard router will still run at 1Gbps, making the extra speed capability pointless for your actual network. Before buying, check your router's or switch's spec sheet for a \"2.5GbE\" or \"2500Mbps\" port rating rather than assuming any recent router supports it, since even many current mid-range routers still ship with only Gigabit ports."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Match the connector type to every device you'll actually use it on",
    explanation: "USB-C ethernet adapters come in two connector styles: USB-C only, or a dual USB-A and USB-C design that works with both port types from one adapter. If your household or office mixes an older USB-A desktop with a newer USB-C laptop, a USB-C-only adapter locks you out of the older machine entirely, forcing you to buy a second adapter or a separate USB-A-to-USB-C cable. Check the product photos and title for \"USB-A\" or \"dual connector\" language specifically, since some listings bury this detail in a small print spec table rather than the main bullet points."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Verify power delivery wattage against your laptop's actual charger",
    explanation: "Some 2.5GbE adapters add a USB-C Power Delivery passthrough port so the same cable can charge your laptop and carry the ethernet connection at once, but the PD wattage rating matters more than the fact that PD exists at all. A 100W-rated passthrough port charges most 13 to 14 inch laptops and MacBooks at full speed, but a 16 inch MacBook Pro or a gaming laptop that ships with a 140W or higher charger will charge more slowly through a 100W adapter than through its included charger. Check your laptop's included charger's wattage rating (printed on the charger brick itself) before assuming a PD passthrough adapter will fully replace it."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Read the documented OS list, not just \"universal compatibility\"",
    explanation: "A listing that says an adapter is \"universally compatible\" is telling you less than one that names specific operating systems and driver requirements, because Linux kernel support in particular varies a lot even among adapters using the identical Realtek chipset. Some listings explicitly warn that older Linux kernels or certain distributions need the latest Realtek USB 2.5G Ethernet Controller driver installed manually rather than working out of the box, which is a real setup step, not a guarantee. If you run Linux or ChromeOS as your primary system, prioritize a listing that names your specific OS and driver behavior over one that only claims broad, unspecified compatibility."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Do I need a special router to get the full 2.5Gbps speed from these adapters?",
    a: "Yes. The adapter only reaches 2.5Gbps if the router, switch, or NAS on the other end of the ethernet cable also supports 2.5GbE. Plugging a 2.5GbE adapter into a standard Gigabit router will cap your speed at 1Gbps, so check your router's port rating before buying based on the higher speed number."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a USB-C-only adapter with an older USB-A laptop using a cheap converter dongle?",
    a: "It's not recommended for sustained 2.5Gbps speeds. A generic USB-A-to-USB-C converter can introduce a bandwidth bottleneck that undercuts the adapter's rated speed. If you have a mix of USB-A and USB-C devices, a dual-connector adapter like the Plugable base model is the more reliable choice."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 100W power delivery adapter worth the extra cost over a standard model?",
    a: "It depends on whether you want to eliminate a second charging cable. If your laptop charges at 100W or under, the PD passthrough model lets you use one cable for both ethernet and power. If your laptop needs more than 100W (common on larger gaming laptops or 16-inch MacBook Pros), the PD passthrough won't fully replace your original charger, so the extra cost buys less value in that case."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do some listings not mention their chipset at all?",
    a: "A manufacturer that skips naming the chipset is sometimes using a cheaper, less-supported chip and relying on the \"2.5G\" headline number to sell the product. It's not an automatic dealbreaker, but it means you can't verify driver maturity on your specific OS ahead of time the way you can with a named Realtek chipset."
  },
  {
    q: "Will these adapters work with a MacBook running the latest macOS?",
    a: "Adapters using the Realtek RTL8156BG chipset, which covers most picks in this comparison, have native macOS support without a manual driver install. Listings that specifically name MacBook Pro or MacBook Air compatibility, like the UGREEN and Satechi picks, have confirmed this directly against recent Apple Silicon models."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to install any drivers before these adapters work?",
    a: "Most work as true plug-and-play on Windows and macOS with the Realtek chipset covered here. Linux and older ChromeOS versions are the exception: some listings, particularly Cable Matters, explicitly note that certain Linux kernels need the latest Realtek USB 2.5G Ethernet Controller driver installed manually for full performance."
