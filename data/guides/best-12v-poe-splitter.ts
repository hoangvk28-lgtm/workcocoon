export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 12V Splitter's Amperage Rating Determines Real Continuous Power Delivery, Not Just the Voltage Number Alone",
    "explanation": "The Gigabit pick specifically delivers 2A (24W) continuous output, double the amperage of the Bawofu pick's 1.2A (about 14.4W) rating, even though both splitters output the identical 12V, showing that voltage alone doesn't tell you a splitter's real power delivery capability. This matters significantly if your specific device draws more current than a lower-amperage splitter can supply, since an underpowered splitter could cause your device to malfunction or fail to power on at all. Check a 12V splitter's specific amperage or wattage rating, not just its voltage figure, against your exact device's power draw requirement before purchasing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Power-Matching Rule Requires the Splitter's Output to Exceed, Not Just Match, Your Device's Power Requirement",
    "explanation": "The TIENFOKOTA pick specifically explains that a splitter's output power must exceed the device's power requirement, giving a concrete example that a 12V/1A device needing 12W should use a splitter rated at least 12W, not exactly 12W, to account for real-world power delivery margins. This matters if you're selecting a splitter close to your device's exact power draw, where cutting it too close could result in inadequate power under real operating conditions. Select a splitter with some power headroom above your device's stated requirement, rather than matching the numbers exactly, to ensure reliable operation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Explicit Surge Protection Voltage Ratings Provide Real, Checkable Assurance Against Electrical Damage",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically states 4KV surge protection, a concrete rating that quantifies how much transient voltage spike the splitter can absorb before failing, distinct from a vague 'protected' claim on a competing splitter that doesn't specify an actual voltage rating. This matters if you're installing in a location with real electrical surge risk from storms or unstable power, and matters less in a stable, sheltered indoor environment. Compare specific surge protection voltage ratings across splitters, rather than assuming any 'protected' claim provides equivalent safeguarding."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE Mode A and Mode B Compatibility Determines Which PoE Sources a Splitter Can Actually Work With",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick specifically states support for both PoE Mode A and Mode B, the two different methods PoE equipment uses to deliver power over the same Ethernet cable's different wire pairs, giving broader compatibility with more PoE switches and injectors than a splitter supporting only one mode. This matters if you're not certain which mode your specific PoE switch or injector uses, and matters less if you've already confirmed your PoE source's exact mode compatibility. Check whether a splitter specifically supports both PoE modes if you want broader compatibility assurance across different PoE source equipment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Two-Pack Format Delivers Better Per-Unit Value Specifically When You Need to Convert Two or More Devices",
    "explanation": "The TIENFOKOTA, LINOVISION, and Bawofu picks all specifically bundle two splitters in one purchase, working out to a lower per-unit cost than buying a single splitter twice, a genuine value consideration if you have two devices needing PoE-to-12V conversion. This matters if you're specifically converting two separate devices, where a 2-pack delivers real savings, and matters less if you only have one device, where the single-unit Gigabit pick avoids paying for an unused second unit. Count your actual number of devices needing conversion before choosing between a single-unit and multi-pack purchase."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "How do I know if a 12V PoE splitter has enough power for my camera?", "a": "Check your camera's stated voltage and amperage requirement, then choose a splitter rated at or above that requirement, following the TIENFOKOTA pick's specific guidance that the splitter's output power should exceed, not just match, your device's power needs." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 12V PoE splitter?", "a": "Assuming all 12V splitters deliver the same power simply because they share the same voltage rating, when amperage output specifically ranges from 1.2A to 2A across the picks in this comparison, a real difference in continuous power delivery." },
  { "q": "Is the Gigabit PoE Splitter worth the price over the Bawofu pick if I don't need Gigabit speed?", "a": "If your device doesn't need Gigabit bandwidth and you're powering two separate devices, the Bawofu 2-pack's lower price delivers good value, but if you need higher amperage or Gigabit speed, the top pick's higher output justifies its price." },
  { "q": "Do I need a waterproof 12V PoE splitter for an indoor camera installation?", "a": "No, a waterproof rating like the TIENFOKOTA or LINOVISION picks' IP55 rating provides no practical benefit for a fully indoor installation, so a non-waterproof splitter like the Gigabit pick or Bawofu pick is a more cost-appropriate choice." },
  { "q": "Can I use a 12V PoE splitter with any PoE switch or injector?", "a": "Most splitters work with standard IEEE 802.3af/at PoE switches and injectors within the 44-57V input range, though checking specific PoE Mode A/B compatibility, like the LINOVISION pick explicitly states, helps confirm broader compatibility with your exact PoE source." },
  { "q": "Why do some 12V PoE splitters cost more than others with seemingly similar specs?", "a": "Price differences often reflect real feature differences like explicit surge protection ratings, waterproof certifications, Gigabit versus 100Mbps speed, or pack size, so comparing these specific features rather than price alone helps identify genuine value differences." }
