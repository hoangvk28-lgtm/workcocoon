export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Desktop Duplex Scan Speed Can Differ by Nearly 4x Even Within the Same Price Range",
    "explanation": "The Canon R40II scans duplex at up to 45ppm while the portable Canon R10 manages only 12ppm despite both offering genuine two-sided capture, a difference driven by internal scanning mechanism design and feeder engineering rather than just marketing. If you're regularly scanning large stacks, this speed difference compounds fast, turning a five-minute job into a twenty-minute one on the slower unit. Always compare the specific stated pages-per-minute figure for duplex mode, not just whether duplex is supported at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Proprietary-Software-Only Scanners Trade Flexibility for Simplicity",
    "explanation": "The Canon R40II explicitly states it's designed exclusively for its included CaptureOnTouch software and does not support TWAIN or ISIS drivers, meaning it won't integrate with certain third-party document management systems that expect those standard driver interfaces. This is a real limitation for a business with an existing software workflow built around TWAIN, even though CaptureOnTouch itself is straightforward for typical scanning tasks. Check a listing's stated software compatibility before assuming any scanner will plug into your existing document management setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Genuine Wireless Scanning Removes the One-Computer Bottleneck a USB-Only Scanner Creates",
    "explanation": "The ScanSnap iX1300 can send scans to multiple devices, including phones and tablets, and even operate without a computer connected at all, while USB-only scanners like the Canon picks in this comparison require a direct cable connection to one specific machine. This matters in a shared space where more than one person needs to scan documents without physically relocating the scanner or unplugging cables repeatedly. Check whether Wi-Fi is genuinely built in versus a listing simply mentioning cloud-service compatibility that still requires a wired computer connection to initiate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Feeder Sheet Capacity Directly Limits How Long You Can Walk Away From a Scanning Job",
    "explanation": "A 60-sheet feeder on the Canon R40II lets you load a substantial stack and return once it finishes, while a 20-sheet feeder like the Canon R10's requires refilling roughly three times as often for the same total document count. This matters most for anyone digitizing a large backlog of paperwork in one sitting, where feeder capacity translates directly into hands-off time saved. Check the specific sheet count stated for the automatic feeder rather than assuming any duplex scanner handles large stacks equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Scanner's Power Draw and Connection Type Affect Where You Can Realistically Use It",
    "explanation": "The Canon R10 draws just 2.5W through a single USB cable with no separate power adapter, making it usable anywhere a laptop is, while a scanner requiring a dedicated wall outlet effectively becomes fixed-location equipment regardless of its physical size. If you need to move a scanner between rooms or locations regularly, prioritize genuine USB-only power over a scanner that happens to be physically small but still needs its own outlet. Check the listed power requirements explicitly rather than assuming compact size implies portability."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the Canon imageFORMULA R40II work with third-party scanning software like TWAIN-based document management systems?", "a": "No, it's designed exclusively for Canon's included CaptureOnTouch software and explicitly does not support TWAIN or ISIS drivers, so confirm your existing software workflow is compatible before buying." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing desktop and portable duplex scanners?", "a": "Assuming any duplex scanner delivers similar speed, when in reality a desktop model like the Canon R40II can scan nearly four times faster than a portable duplex model like the Canon R10 due to its larger, more powerful internal mechanism." },
  { "q": "Is the ScanSnap iX1300 worth the price premium over the Canon R40II?", "a": "If wireless scanning and a smaller desk footprint matter more to you than raw speed, yes, but if maximum duplex throughput at 45ppm and a larger 60-sheet feeder matter more, the Canon R40II offers more scanning power for a lower price." },
  { "q": "Can the ScanSnap iX1300 be used without connecting it to a computer at all?", "a": "Yes, its Wi-Fi connectivity lets it send scans directly to mobile devices or cloud services without a computer in the loop, a capability none of the other picks in this comparison offer." },
  { "q": "How often will I need to refill the feeder on the Canon R40II versus the Canon R10?", "a": "The R40II's 60-sheet feeder holds three times as many pages as the R10's 20-sheet feeder, so for the same document stack you'll refill the R10 roughly three times as often." },
  { "q": "Is the Epson ES-50 still a reasonable choice at this price tier, or should I upgrade to a duplex model?", "a": "If you mostly scan single-sided pages occasionally and want to save money, the ES-50 remains a solid, fast choice, but if you regularly handle two-sided documents, any of the duplex picks in this comparison will save real time over manually re-scanning the back of each page." }
