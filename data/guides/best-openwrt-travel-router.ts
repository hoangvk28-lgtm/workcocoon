export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "OpenWrt Firmware Version Affects Which Plugins and Security Updates Are Actually Available to You",
    "explanation": "OpenWrt releases new firmware versions periodically, each supporting a somewhat different set of plugins and receiving security patches for a defined support window, meaning a router still shipping an older version like 21.02 may not support the newest plugins or receive updates as long as a router already running a newer version like 23.05. This matters if you plan to install specific newer OpenWrt packages that require a more recent kernel, and matters less if your plugin needs are basic and well-supported across both older and newer versions. Check a specific router's shipped OpenWrt version and compare it against the plugin ecosystem's current documentation before assuming any OpenWrt router supports every available package."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Available RAM and Flash Storage Directly Limits How Many OpenWrt Plugins You Can Realistically Install",
    "explanation": "OpenWrt plugins consume both RAM while running and flash storage space when installed, and a router with limited storage, like the AR300M16's 128MB RAM and 16MB flash, can only support a modest number of lightweight plugins before running out of space, while a router with 512MB storage like the Slate 7 or Beryl 7 has considerably more headroom for running several plugins simultaneously. This matters significantly if you plan to run multiple OpenWrt applications together, like a VPN client, ad-blocker, and network monitoring tool at once, and matters less if you only need one or two basic plugins. Check a router's specific RAM and flash storage figures against your planned plugin list's combined storage requirements before assuming any OpenWrt device has sufficient headroom."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Touchscreen Interface on an OpenWrt Router Provides Real Convenience Beyond What a Web Admin Panel Offers",
    "explanation": "A router with a physical touchscreen, like the Slate 7, lets you scan Wi-Fi QR codes, monitor real-time speed, and toggle VPN settings directly on the device itself without needing to open a laptop or phone app and navigate a web admin panel, a genuinely faster interaction for quick checks while traveling. This matters more if you frequently need to make quick network adjustments on the go without convenient access to another device, and matters less if you're comfortable managing settings through a phone app or web browser exclusively. Consider a touchscreen-equipped OpenWrt router specifically if this kind of direct, at-a-glance control has real value for your travel routine."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "OpenWrt's Community Support and Documentation Depth Varies by How Widely Deployed a Specific Router Model Is",
    "explanation": "A router model with a larger existing user base tends to have more community-created guides, forum threads, and troubleshooting resources available if you run into a configuration issue, while a newer or less common model may have thinner community documentation even if its underlying OpenWrt version is technically current. This matters more if you're new to OpenWrt and likely to need troubleshooting help, and matters less if you're already experienced with OpenWrt configuration and comfortable working from official documentation alone. Check a specific router model's community forum activity and documentation depth if you anticipate needing troubleshooting support as an OpenWrt beginner."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "OpenWrt Customization Depth Doesn't Require the Most Expensive or Newest Hardware to Be Genuinely Useful",
    "explanation": "The most affordable and physically smallest router in this comparison still runs full OpenWrt with VPN client and server capability, proving that meaningful customization doesn't require paying for the newest Wi-Fi standard or the largest available storage if your plugin needs are modest. This matters if you specifically want OpenWrt's core customization and VPN benefits without needing Wi-Fi 7 speed or extensive plugin storage, and matters less if you have specific plans requiring more storage headroom or newer wireless capability. Match your actual plugin and performance needs to the appropriate price tier rather than assuming the most expensive OpenWrt router is automatically necessary for genuine customization."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the benefit of OpenWrt over a router's stock firmware?", "a": "OpenWrt unlocks thousands of installable plugins and deep configuration control over VPN routing, firewall rules, and network behavior that a stock firmware interface typically doesn't expose." },
  { "q": "Do I need the newest OpenWrt firmware version for basic VPN use?", "a": "No, both OpenWrt 21.02 and 23.05 support standard VPN client functionality reliably; the newer version matters more if you plan to install specific newer plugins that require a more recent kernel." },
  { "q": "How much storage do I need for OpenWrt plugins?", "a": "For a few basic plugins like a VPN client, even 128MB RAM and 16MB flash can suffice, but running multiple plugins simultaneously, like VPN, ad-blocking, and monitoring together, benefits from the 512MB storage found on higher-end models." },
  { "q": "Is a touchscreen necessary on an OpenWrt travel router?", "a": "No, it's a convenience feature for quick on-device adjustments; you can fully manage any OpenWrt router through its web admin panel or mobile app without a physical touchscreen." },
  { "q": "Can a budget OpenWrt travel router run a VPN server, not just a client?", "a": "Yes, even the smallest and cheapest OpenWrt router in this comparison specifically supports VPN server capability alongside client mode, letting you remotely access your home network while traveling." },
  { "q": "Does OpenWrt void a travel router's warranty?", "a": "Most GL.iNet routers ship with OpenWrt pre-installed as their standard firmware rather than requiring you to flash it yourself, so using OpenWrt normally doesn't affect the manufacturer's warranty." }
