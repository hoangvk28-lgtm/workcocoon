  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What makes an office chair 'executive'?", a: "An executive office chair typically features a high back that extends above the shoulder blades, padded armrests, leather upholstery (genuine or synthetic), and a traditional aesthetic that signals seniority or authority in a professional setting. Functionally, executive chairs prioritize a visual profile associated with professional spaces. The best executive chairs combine this aesthetic with ergonomic adjustability for practical daily use." },
  { q: "Is a Herman Miller or Steelcase chair worth the price for an executive?", a: "For executives sitting 6-plus hours daily, the long-term cost of a Herman Miller or Steelcase chair is actually lower than buying and replacing budget executive chairs every 2 to 3 years. The 12 to 15-year warranty and known durability mean a $1,200 Steelcase Gesture costs $100 per year over 12 years, compared to a $350 budget executive chair replaced every 3 years at $117 per year - plus the daily cost in back discomfort and reduced performance." },
  { q: "Can I use an executive chair with a standing desk?", a: "Yes, but most traditional executive chairs sit at fixed heights around 17 to 22 inches, which works for standard 28 to 30-inch desks. If you adjust your standing desk height for standing use, you typically need to lower it back for sitting. The chair height doesn't need to match standing desk height - only sitting desk height. For the sitting interval, any ergonomic executive chair works with any sit-stand desk." },
  { q: "What is the best executive chair for video calls?", a: "For video calls where your chair is visible, a high-back leather executive chair with a headrest provides the strongest professional visual. The BOSS High-Back, NEO CHAIR Executive, and FlexiSpot BS13B all deliver this at mid-range prices. If you want combined performance and aesthetics for both daily work and video visibility, the Steelcase Gesture leather is the most complete option." },
  { q: "How do I choose between genuine leather and PU leather for an executive chair?", a: "Genuine leather outlasts PU leather significantly with proper care - decades vs 3 to 5 years. The initial cost difference is offset over time if you keep the chair. Genuine leather requires conditioning every 3 to 6 months to prevent cracking. PU leather requires only wiping clean. In air-conditioned offices, both types feel similar daily. In warm environments, genuine leather breathes slightly better. See our [best leather office chair](/guide/best-leather-office-chair) guide for a full comparison." },
