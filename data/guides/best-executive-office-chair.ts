    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best executive office chairs in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best executive office chairs in 2026 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What makes an office chair 'executive'?", a: "An executive office chair typically features a high back that extends above the shoulder blades, padded armrests, leather upholstery (genuine or synthetic), and a traditional aesthetic that signals seniority or authority in a professional setting. Functionally, executive chairs prioritize a visual profile associated with professional spaces. The best executive chairs combine this aesthetic with ergonomic adjustability for practical daily use." },
  { q: "Is a Herman Miller or Steelcase chair worth the price for an executive?", a: "For executives sitting 6-plus hours daily, the long-term cost of a Herman Miller or Steelcase chair is actually lower than buying and replacing budget executive chairs every 2 to 3 years. The 12 to 15-year warranty and known durability mean a $1,200 Steelcase Gesture costs $100 per year over 12 years, compared to a $350 budget executive chair replaced every 3 years at $117 per year - plus the daily cost in back discomfort and reduced performance." },
  { q: "Can I use an executive chair with a standing desk?", a: "Yes, but most traditional executive chairs sit at fixed heights around 17 to 22 inches, which works for standard 28 to 30-inch desks. If you adjust your standing desk height for standing use, you typically need to lower it back for sitting. The chair height doesn't need to match standing desk height - only sitting desk height. For the sitting interval, any ergonomic executive chair works with any sit-stand desk." },
  { q: "What is the best executive chair for video calls?", a: "For video calls where your chair is visible, a high-back leather executive chair with a headrest provides the strongest professional visual. The BOSS High-Back, NEO CHAIR Executive, and FlexiSpot BS13B all deliver this at mid-range prices. If you want combined performance and aesthetics for both daily work and video visibility, the Steelcase Gesture leather is the most complete option." },
  { q: "How do I choose between genuine leather and PU leather for an executive chair?", a: "Genuine leather outlasts PU leather significantly with proper care - decades vs 3 to 5 years. The initial cost difference is offset over time if you keep the chair. Genuine leather requires conditioning every 3 to 6 months to prevent cracking. PU leather requires only wiping clean. In air-conditioned offices, both types feel similar daily. In warm environments, genuine leather breathes slightly better. See our [best leather office chair](/guide/best-leather-office-chair) guide for a full comparison." },
