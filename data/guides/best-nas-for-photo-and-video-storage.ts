  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "Do I need a 10GbE NAS for photo and video editing?",
    a: "Only if you're a multi-editor team working with 4K RAW footage. A single editor working in 4K H.264 is well served by 2.5GbE, which moves about 300 MB/s versus roughly 125 MB/s on standard 1GbE. None of the picks in this list ship with 10GbE built in, so a heavy multi-user RAW pipeline generally needs a step up beyond this tier.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will adding an NVMe cache drive speed up my video transfers?",
    a: "Not meaningfully. NVMe cache accelerates random reads and writes, useful for metadata lookups and photo thumbnail generation, but it does very little for large sequential video file transfers. If your priority is faster video file access, a faster network connection and main-bay throughput matter far more than adding a cache drive.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can any of these NAS models transcode ProRes footage?",
    a: "No. H.264 is broadly supported for hardware transcoding on Intel Celeron-class NAS chips, and H.265/HEVC needs Intel QuickSync or an equivalent modern processor. No consumer NAS hardware-transcodes ProRes; it only happens in slow software, so ProRes workflows are better handled by editing locally off the NAS rather than expecting on-NAS conversion.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 2-bay or 4-bay NAS better for a growing photo and video archive?",
    a: "A 2-bay NAS like the UGREEN DXP2800 or DH2300 keeps entry cost lower and works well for a solo creator or modest library. A 4-bay unit like the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus supports RAID 5 with meaningfully more usable capacity and headroom to add drives over time, which better fits a professional or continuously growing archive.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the NAS itself affect color accuracy in my photos and video?",
    a: "No. A NAS only stores files; color rendering comes from your monitor and its calibration. For color-critical work, connect a calibrated monitor natively rather than through a compressed connection, and reach the NAS over Ethernet purely for file access.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is the total cost so much higher than the NAS enclosure price?",
    a: "Every NAS in this list is diskless, meaning drives are sold separately. A 2-bay enclosure plus 2 NAS-grade drives, or a 4-bay plus 4 drives, commonly runs close to double the enclosure's listed price. Always budget the full enclosure-plus-drives total before comparing prices across different bay counts.",
