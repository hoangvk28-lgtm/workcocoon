Each slot adjusts from 0.55 to 1.65 inches and locks independently, so a thin MacBook Air and a thicker Windows laptop can share the same stand without compromise. It is the most affordable dual-slot aluminum stand with independent per-slot adjustment and a lifetime warranty.

    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best vertical laptop stands (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best vertical laptop stands (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this 8 best vertical laptop stands (2026) over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any 8 best vertical laptop stands (2026) you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A 8 best vertical laptop stands (2026) that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Do vertical laptop stands work with all laptop brands?", a: "Adjustable-width vertical stands work with virtually all laptop brands including MacBook, Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, and others. The stands listed here adjust from under 0.5 inches to over 2.5 inches of slot width, which covers nearly all consumer laptops including older thicker models and current thin ultrabooks." },
  { q: "How do you use a laptop in a vertical stand?", a: "Close the laptop lid and place it in the vertical stand. Connect an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the laptop. The laptop enters clamshell mode automatically and operates normally with the external display as the primary screen. The built-in laptop display turns off in clamshell mode." },
  { q: "Are vertical laptop stands bad for laptops?", a: "No. Vertical storage does not damage laptop hardware, displays, or batteries. The thermal design of modern laptops handles vertical orientation without overheating. All stands in this roundup include protective silicone padding at contact points to prevent chassis scratching." },
  { q: "What is the difference between a laptop stand and a laptop riser?", a: "A vertical stand holds the laptop in portrait orientation for clamshell desk use. A riser elevates the laptop at a horizontal angle to raise the screen to eye level for direct laptop screen use. They solve different problems: vertical stands store the laptop out of the way; risers bring the screen to ergonomic height." },
  { q: "Can a vertical stand hold a laptop while it is charging?", a: "Yes. The laptop charges normally in a vertical stand as long as the charging cable reaches the port. Most vertical stands leave the charging port side open. Stands with cable cutouts (UGREEN) route the cable more cleanly through the base." }
