  "We compared this lineup on stated weight capacity for heavy hardcover collections, glass versus acrylic door quality for display pieces, and construction method (ladder-style versus back-panel reinforced), since at this price the meaningful differences are genuine engineering upgrades, not just a taller box."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A 300 Lb Total Capacity Provides Real Headroom for a Large Hardcover Collection",
    "explanation": "The TVU pick's stated 300 lb total weight capacity, with 50 lbs per individual shelf, provides genuine confidence for a substantial collection of heavy hardcover books, especially when distributed across all six tiers, compared to bookshelves rated for 150-200 lbs total that could approach their limit faster with a similarly sized collection. If you have an extensive or particularly heavy book collection, this higher capacity rating is a real, checkable engineering difference worth prioritizing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 90 Degree Rear Design Solves a Genuine Room-Layout Flexibility Problem",
    "explanation": "The Tribesigns pick's 90 degree right angle rear design specifically allows the bookshelf to stand freely in the middle of a room, functioning as a visual divider, or sit flush against a wall like a traditional bookshelf, without looking incomplete or unfinished from either angle. Standard bookshelves often have an unfinished-looking back meant only to face a wall, so this dual-orientation design is a genuine placement flexibility advantage if you're considering using the bookshelf as a room divider."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Glass Doors Protect Displayed Items From Dust in a Way Open Shelving Fundamentally Cannot",
    "explanation": "The Loomie pick's transparent glass doors let you display collectibles, art books, or photos while physically sealing them off from dust accumulation, a genuinely different level of protection than even the most carefully maintained open shelving can provide over months and years. If you're storing items that are sensitive to dust or that you want to keep looking pristine with minimal cleaning effort, glass-door protection is a meaningful functional upgrade, not just a stylistic choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Adjustable Foot Pads Matter More on Taller, Heavier Bookshelves Than Shorter Ones",
    "explanation": "The HOMISSUE pick's 4 adjustable foot pads specifically address stability concerns unique to a tall, nearly 71-inch bookshelf, where even minor floor unevenness can be amplified by the unit's height and lead to a genuinely unstable structure if left unaddressed. A shorter bookshelf is less sensitive to this issue, but for any bookshelf approaching 6-7 feet tall, adjustable leveling feet are a meaningful stability feature worth confirming is included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Dual-Purpose Design Like a Built-In Reading Nook Adds Genuine Functional Value Beyond Storage",
    "explanation": "The Loomie pick's deep lower cabinet, specifically designed to double as a reading nook with a cushion, transforms the bookshelf from pure storage furniture into a functional living space feature, a genuinely different value proposition than a bookshelf that only stores items. This kind of dual-purpose design is worth prioritizing if you have a small living space where furniture needs to serve multiple functions rather than dedicating separate pieces to storage and seating."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the TVU's 300 lb total capacity actually necessary for a typical home book collection?", "a": "For a large or growing collection, particularly one with many heavy hardcover books, yes, this higher capacity provides genuine peace of mind; for a smaller or lighter paperback-focused collection, a bookshelf with a more modest capacity rating would likely suffice." },
  { "q": "Can the Tribesigns ladder bookshelf actually be used as a room divider given its 90 degree rear design?", "a": "Yes, its finished rear design specifically supports this use case, looking presentable from both the front and back, unlike bookshelves designed only to face a wall, making it a genuinely functional choice for dividing an open living space." },
  { "q": "Does the Loomie's reading nook cabinet actually fit an adult comfortably?", "a": "The listing describes the deep lower cabinet as a cozy reading nook when a cushion is added, suggesting a compact, intimate seating space rather than a full-size reading chair replacement; check the specific interior dimensions if comfortable adult seating is your primary goal." },
  { "q": "How do the adjustable foot pads on the HOMISSUE bookshelf actually work?", "a": "They typically screw in or out to change height slightly at each of the four base points, allowing you to compensate for minor floor unevenness and keep the tall unit level and stable, a straightforward adjustment usually made during or after assembly." },
  { "q": "Is glass on the Loomie bookcase doors tempered or standard glass?", "a": "The listing doesn't specify tempered glass explicitly; if this is an important safety consideration for your household, particularly with children present, it's worth confirming directly with the seller before purchasing." },
  { "q": "Which pick in this comparison offers the best value if I want high capacity without paying for glass doors?", "a": "The TVU 6-Tier Wooden Bookshelf offers the highest weight capacity in this comparison without the added cost of glass doors, making it the strongest value pick specifically for buyers prioritizing raw storage capacity over display protection." }
