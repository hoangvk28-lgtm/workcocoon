      "This keyboard tray mounts under the desk via a C-clamp and slides out on a retractable arm, dropping the keyboard to a position below desk surface height so your wrists sit at a more neutral angle during long typing sessions. The 27-inch platform is wide enough to hold a full-size keyboard and a mouse side by side without crowding either. A shallow pencil drawer is built into the front edge of the platform, giving you a place for pens, sticky notes, and small supplies without taking up any space on the desk itself.\n\nBecause the clamp mechanism attaches to the desk edge without drilling, the tray can be removed and reinstalled if you move or switch desks. This product is primarily a keyboard positioning tool with bonus storage, not a general-purpose under-desk drawer, so buyers expecting large compartments should look at pure storage options instead.",

The combination of engineered wood shelves and a steel frame gives it a sturdier appearance than all-plastic alternatives. It is the most expensive option in this roundup by a notable margin, which makes it difficult to justify without greater confidence in its long-term performance.

It costs less than the Euyona, which makes it appealing for buyers on a tighter budget who still want swivel functionality. The swivel mechanism adds a point of mechanical complexity that a fixed-position drawer does not have, so buyers who do not specifically need rotation may find a simpler fixed drawer more reliable over time.

    q: "What is the difference between a keyboard tray and a clamp-on desk drawer?",
    a: "A keyboard tray extends below the desk to reposition the keyboard ergonomically. A clamp-on drawer hangs under the desk for storage only. The VIVO and BONTEC in this roundup are keyboard trays with a small pencil drawer included. The Homeify, Euyona, and INLDY are pure storage drawers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do clamp-on desk drawers work on all desks?",
    a: "Most clamp-on products fit desks 0.75 to 2 inches thick. Verify the clamp range in the listing before purchasing. Desks with unusual edge profiles, very thick tops, or glass surfaces may be incompatible. Sit-stand desks need products specifically rated for height adjustment cycles.",

  {
    q: "Which clamp-on drawer is best for sit-stand desks?",
    a: "The VIVO 22-inch at $69.99 is the only pure storage drawer in this roundup explicitly rated as sit-stand compatible. The VIVO keyboard tray is also sit-stand compatible. Standard clamp-on drawers may loosen through repeated height adjustment cycles.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can I store in a clamp-on desk drawer?",
    a: "Clamp-on drawers are shallow. They suit small items like pens, notepads, USB drives, charging cables, and small accessories. They are not suited for heavy items, large documents, or thick notebooks. The keyboard tray models include only a small pencil drawer, not a general storage compartment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the 360-degree swivel feature practical?",
    a: "The swivel feature on the Euyona and RHBLME is useful for corner desks where the drawer needs to face a different direction from the edge, or for users who sit at an angle to their desk. For straight-on desk use, swivel adds mechanical complexity without practical benefit.",
