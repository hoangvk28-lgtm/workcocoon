    q: "What is a good size for a small desk in a bedroom?",
    a: "40-47\" wide and 22-24\" deep is the most practical bedroom desk size. Under 40\" limits monitor ergonomics without a monitor arm. Over 48\" starts to feel like a dedicated home office piece rather than a bedroom desk.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a monitor on a small desk?",
    a: "Yes, with the right setup. Desk depth of 22\"+ allows a monitor to sit at safe viewing distance (20\"+) with room for a keyboard. If your desk is under 20\" deep, use a monitor arm - it eliminates the monitor stand footprint and extends the screen to a comfortable distance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a solid wood desk and a veneer desk?",
    a: "A solid wood desk has a top, legs, and frame all made from hardwood. A veneer desk has a thin wood facing (typically 0.6-3mm) bonded over an MDF or particle board core. Veneer looks similar but cannot be refinished deeply if damaged. Solid wood can be sanded and refinished. The IOTXY desk (Rank 1 on this list) uses solid wood framing with a veneer desktop surface.",

    q: "Is rubberwood or pine better for a small desk?",
    a: "Both are adequate for light daily use. Rubberwood (parawood) is harder (~980 lbf Janka) and more moisture-resistant. Pine is softer (~870 lbf) and shows dents more easily but is often less expensive. For a bedroom desk with normal light use, both are acceptable.",
