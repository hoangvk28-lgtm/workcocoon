export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify your exact mini PC model against the mount's stated compatibility list",
    "explanation": "Mini PC mounts and brackets are built around specific chassis dimensions and screw-hole patterns, and unlike a universal VESA monitor mount, many mini PC brackets are designed for one specific brand's chassis shape, such as Dell OptiPlex Micro, Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny, HP EliteDesk Mini, or a specific generation of Mac mini.\n\nMounting hardware that doesn't match your exact model can fail to align with the screw holes at all, or worse, only partially secure the device, creating a real risk of it working loose over time in a mount that's supposed to hold it stationary.\n\nCheck the listing's stated compatible models and generations specifically against your own mini PC's exact model number, not just the general \"mini PC\" category claim in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the mount's actual mounting surface (VESA, rack, wall, or under-desk) matches your install location",
    "explanation": "Mini PC mounts split into genuinely different installation categories: VESA mounts attach to the back of a monitor or TV using the standardized VESA hole pattern, rack mounts fit a 10-inch home-lab or 19-inch commercial server rack, wall mounts attach directly to drywall or a stud, and under-desk mounts clamp to the underside of a desk surface, and these are not interchangeable hardware despite all falling under the same general product category.\n\nBuying a rack-format shelf when you actually need a VESA bracket, for instance, means the hardware simply won't attach to your intended surface at all, since the mounting mechanism itself is fundamentally different between categories.\n\nIdentify your specific installation surface first (monitor back, rack, wall, or desk underside) and filter specifically for that mount type, rather than searching generically for \"mini PC mount\" and assuming any result will work for your setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the stated weight capacity against your mini PC's actual weight",
    "explanation": "A mount's weight capacity, when disclosed, reflects how much load the bracket's screws, arms, and adhesive or clamping mechanism can safely hold long-term without gradually sagging, loosening, or failing outright, and mini PCs vary meaningfully in weight depending on their chassis material and internal components, from under a pound for the lightest fanless designs to several pounds for units with larger heatsinks or multiple drive bays.\n\nMounting a device at or near a bracket's rated limit, especially on a mount holding the device at an angle or overhead behind a monitor, leaves little margin for the natural loosening that happens over months of use, vibration, or repeated adjustment.\n\nWeigh your specific mini PC model (check its listed weight spec) against the mount's stated capacity, and favor a mount with meaningful headroom above your device's actual weight rather than one rated right at the edge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider port and cable access after the mount is installed, not just before",
    "explanation": "A mini PC's ports are typically concentrated on the rear and sometimes front panel, and once mounted, especially behind a monitor, inside a rack, or under a desk, those ports can become significantly harder to reach for routine tasks like plugging in a USB drive or checking a status light, even though the mount holds the device perfectly securely.\n\nSome mounts are specifically designed to preserve front-panel port access after installation, while others prioritize a low-profile or flush mount that trades away easy access for a cleaner look, and this is a real day-to-day usability tradeoff that photos alone don't always make obvious.\n\nThink through which ports you'll need to access regularly after mounting (power, a USB drive, HDMI swaps) and check whether the specific mount's design keeps those reachable, rather than only checking that it physically holds the device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what installation hardware is actually included versus what you'll need to source separately",
    "explanation": "Mount listings vary in how complete their included hardware kit is, some ship with every screw, VESA adapter plate, and cable tie needed for a full installation, while others assume you already have compatible mounting screws from the mini PC's original packaging or a previous mount, which isn't always the case if you're mounting a device for the first time or switching setups.\n\nThis matters because discovering mid-installation that you're missing a specific screw size or an adapter plate means a delayed setup and a second order, a genuinely avoidable frustration.\n\nCheck the listing's stated included contents specifically, and if you no longer have your mini PC's original mounting screws, confirm the mount ships with compatible replacements rather than assuming they're included by default."
  }
];

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "What makes a mount suitable for thin clients specifically?", a: "Thin clients are lighter and smaller than general Mini PCs, so a well-suited mount doesn't need to be heavily overbuilt. Check that the load rating comfortably covers your device's weight without being excessive." },
  { q: "Should I buy the same mount for my whole office fleet?", a: "Standardizing on one mount across your deployment simplifies IT support and spare-parts planning. If your fleet is a single brand and model, a named-compatible mount like the Lenovo or Dell picks offers the most precise fit." },
  { q: "Can I mount a thin client and a monitor arm on the same VESA point?", a: "Not always. Some mounts, like the Dell OptiPlex Micro pick in this guide, explicitly use the monitor's VESA holes exclusively, which prevents also using that point for a separate monitor arm." },
  { q: "Do thin clients need active cooling in their mount?", a: "Most thin clients run cool enough that a mount's ventilation design (open-frame vs enclosed) matters more than active cooling. Favor open-frame mounts for continuous-operation office use." },
  { q: "Is a generic Mini PC mount fine for a thin client, or do I need a dedicated one?", a: "A generic adjustable mount within the right size range works fine. A dedicated thin-client or named-model mount simply offers a more precise, purpose-fit option if you're standardizing across a fleet." },
