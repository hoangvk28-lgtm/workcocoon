export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Motor Lifespan Figure in Hours Is a Concrete Durability Claim Worth Comparing When Disclosed",
    "explanation": "The MERACH pick specifically states up to 15,000 hours of motor life for its Hall sensor-controlled brushless motor, a concrete, checkable figure that gives you a durability baseline to compare against, unlike listings that simply claim a motor is 'durable' or 'long-lasting' without a specific hour count. This matters more if you plan extended daily use over years, where motor longevity directly affects long-term value, and matters less for occasional or light use where you're unlikely to approach any reasonable motor's rated lifespan. Look for a specific hour figure in a listing's motor description if long-term durability under heavy use is a priority for your purchase decision."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Incline Adjustment Provides Real Convenience During Active Sessions That Manual Systems Can't Match",
    "explanation": "The 450 lb Auto Incline pick's 9-level automatic incline system lets you change intensity at the touch of a button while actively walking, unlike a manual system like the MERACH or TOPUTURE picks where changing incline typically requires stopping to physically adjust the setup. This matters if you specifically want to vary intensity throughout a single workout session, like an interval-style routine alternating between flat and inclined walking, rather than setting one incline level for the entire session. Consider whether your workout style benefits from mid-session incline changes before assuming a manual incline system meets the same practical need as an automatic one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Frame Weight Correlates With Stability, But Heavier Isn't Automatically Better if Portability Matters to You",
    "explanation": "The MERACH pick's 67.7 lb steel frame specifically reduces shaking during use compared to lighter treadmill frames, a genuine stability benefit for heavier users or faster walking paces, but that same weight makes the unit harder to move and store compared to lighter alternatives in this tier. This matters as a real tradeoff: prioritize a heavier frame if stability under load is your top concern, or a lighter frame if you'll be frequently moving or storing the pad in a tight space. Weigh your actual priorities between maximum stability and ease of moving or storing the unit before assuming heavier construction is unconditionally the better choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voice Control and Multi-App Compatibility Serve Different Convenience Needs Than a Single Proprietary App",
    "explanation": "The WELLFIT pick's compatibility across its own app, Kinomap, and Apple Health, plus voice control support, gives you flexibility to integrate with whatever fitness ecosystem you already use, rather than being locked into one proprietary app like some competitors in this tier. This matters if you already track fitness data through Apple Health or a specific platform like Kinomap and want your walking pad data to integrate seamlessly rather than existing in a separate, disconnected app. Check whether a listing specifically names compatibility with platforms you already use, like Apple Health or Google Fit, rather than assuming a single 'app compatible' pad works with your existing fitness tracking setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Comprehensive Included Course Library Adds Real Value Beyond the Hardware Itself if You'll Actually Use It",
    "explanation": "The 450 lb Auto Incline pick's FitYo App includes 50+ coach-led courses and 100 scenic routes at no additional subscription cost, a genuine content library that adds ongoing value beyond the physical hardware, provided you actually engage with guided content rather than just walking independently. This matters if structured workouts or scenic route simulations genuinely motivate you to use the pad consistently, less so if you prefer walking at your own pace without guided programming. Consider your own exercise habits and whether guided content or scenic simulations would genuinely increase your usage before treating an included course library as a major deciding factor."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does the MERACH's higher noise level of 53.6 dB mean it's disruptive during video calls?", "a": "It's louder than the quietest picks in lower tiers, but 53.6 dB is still comparable to a normal conversation level, so while it may be noticeable on a video call microphone, it's unlikely to be significantly disruptive for most typical work-from-home use." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between automatic and manual incline systems at this tier?", "a": "Assuming automatic incline is always worth the premium, when many users set one incline level per session anyway, making a manual system's lower price a better value if you don't specifically need mid-session incline changes." },
  { "q": "Is the MERACH pick worth it over the cheaper 450 lb Auto Incline option?", "a": "If you specifically want the most durable stated motor lifespan and a wider deck for a taller user, yes, but if the highest weight capacity with automatic incline adjustment matters more, the 450 lb pick covers that for about $81 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the WELLFIT's voice control feature works with my existing smart home setup?", "a": "Check the specific listing for named compatible voice assistants, since voice control implementations vary, and confirming compatibility with your existing smart speaker or phone assistant before purchase avoids relying on a feature that might not integrate with your setup." },
  { "q": "Can a taller user comfortably use the standard-width picks in this tier, or is the MERACH's wider deck necessary?", "a": "A taller user can still use the standard-width picks, but the MERACH's specifically marketed 33% wider deck provides meaningfully more stride room, so if you're notably tall or have a longer natural stride, that wider deck is worth prioritizing." },
  { "q": "Do the higher weight capacity picks in this tier require different maintenance than lighter-duty walking pads?", "a": "Not fundamentally different, though heavier daily use under higher weight loads may mean belt lubrication and inspection matter more frequently, so following the specific manufacturer's maintenance schedule for your pick is worth doing regardless of its weight rating." }
