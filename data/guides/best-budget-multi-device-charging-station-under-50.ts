export const faq = [
  {
    q: "What's the difference between USB-A and USB-C charging stations?",
    a: "USB-A stations have the traditional rectangular port. USB-C stations have the newer oval port, which supports faster charging (20–100W+) and works with modern iPhones (15+), iPads, Android flagships, and laptops. If you have devices from 2022 or later, USB-C capability is worth the extra $10.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a $50 charging station charge a laptop?",
    a: "The UGREEN Nexode 65W and Anker Premium 30W USB-C picks can charge laptops at a slow but functional rate. 65W charges a MacBook Air overnight. For a MacBook Pro under active workload, you need 90–140W, that's above $80.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is GaN worth paying for in a budget charging station?",
    a: "Yes, especially for a desk. GaN chargers run significantly cooler, are smaller, and maintain their wattage longer than traditional silicon chargers. The UGREEN Nexode at ~$30–$40 is the clearest example: GaN technology at a price that used to cost $60+.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many watts does an iPhone need to fast charge?",
    a: "iPhone 12 and later fast charges at 20W via USB-C PD. With a 20W adapter and USB-C cable, you go from 0–50% in about 30 minutes. Any station with a 20W+ USB-C PD port achieves this.",
