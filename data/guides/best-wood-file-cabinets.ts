      "The DEVAISE 3 Drawer Rustic Brown earns the top spot because it hits the best intersection of price, practicality, and style. With over 5,300 reviews and a 4.2-star average, it has a much larger feedback base than most competing models in this category. Three drawers give you meaningful storage without the footprint of a four-drawer unit. The bottom drawer is sized for hanging letter or legal-size folders. The mobile base with locking casters lets you slide it under your desk and roll it out when you need access. Buyers consistently note that assembly is straightforward, the finished look is better than expected at this price, and the casters roll smoothly on both hardwood and carpet.",
