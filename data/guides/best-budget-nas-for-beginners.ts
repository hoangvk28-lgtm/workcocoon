      "The UGREEN DH2300 is a diskless 2-bay NAS built around UGREEN's own beginner-friendly UGOS software, which trades some of the deeper app ecosystem of established NAS brands for a simpler, more approachable setup flow. Supporting up to 64TB across its two bays gives a first-time buyer real room to grow into RAID mirroring later.

  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

  {
    q: "Why does a budget NAS cost more than the advertised price?",
    a: "Most 2-bay and 4-bay NAS units in this list ship diskless, meaning the enclosure price doesn't include storage. Adding 2 NAS-grade drives at a reasonable capacity often brings the real total investment close to double the enclosure's sticker price, which is the most common surprise for first-time buyers. Drives-included picks like the Buffalo LinkStation 210 avoid this by bundling the drive into the listed price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should a true beginner buy a diskless NAS or a drives-included one?",
    a: "A drives-included single-bay NAS, like either Buffalo LinkStation 210 pick in this list, is the simplest true-beginner setup since it skips drive shopping and compatibility research entirely. A diskless 2-bay unit like the UGREEN DH2300 or Synology DS223 costs more in total once drives are added, but gains RAID 1 mirroring, which protects your data if one drive fails.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a first NAS setup actually take?",
    a: "Plan for several hours, not minutes, for a fully configured first setup, especially if you want automatic backup, remote access, or media server apps running. The basic network connection is quick, but configuring firewall rules, ports, and backup schedules correctly requires more networking knowledge than most marketing materials suggest.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between NAS and DAS for a beginner?",
    a: "NAS is network-attached storage, reachable from your phone, laptop, and other devices independently over your home network. DAS, like the QNAP TR-004 in this list, connects directly to one computer over USB and isn't accessible from other devices. If centralized, multi-device access is your goal, make sure you're buying true NAS, not DAS.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I even need a NAS, or would a simple external drive work?",
    a: "If you're only backing up one computer, an external USB drive is usually simpler and cheaper than any NAS. A single-drive cloud-connected NAS, like the LinkStation picks, is worth it once you want file access from multiple devices. A full traditional multi-bay NAS earns its added complexity mainly for a real media server or a library that benefits from RAID redundancy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are third-party drive compatibility warnings a dealbreaker on budget NAS units?",
    a: "Usually not. Value-series NAS models tend to be the least restrictive about third-party drives, while stepping up to a Plus-series or higher model can show compatibility warnings that look scary but often only disable some vendor-specific health monitoring rather than blocking the drive from functioning. Check the specific warning's wording before assuming a drive won't work.",
