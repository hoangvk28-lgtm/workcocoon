    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best office chairs under $300 in 2026 often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best office chairs under $300 in 2026 holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Can you get a genuinely ergonomic office chair under $300?", a: "Yes, with realistic expectations. The Branch Ergonomic Chair ($299) includes lumbar height and depth adjustment, 4D armrests, and adjustable seat depth - features that premium chairs at $700 also include. The trade-offs at $300 are typically shorter warranty, less premium mesh quality, and no brand cache. The ergonomic function for preventing back strain during 6-8 hour workdays is real at this price, not just marketing." },
  { q: "What is the difference between a $300 chair and a $1,000 chair?", a: "At $300: adjustable lumbar, breathable mesh, 3-4D armrests, 3-7 year warranty. At $1,000: LiveBack adaptive spines (Steelcase), PostureFit SL dual-point lumbar (Herman Miller), 12-15 year warranty, significantly better mesh quality that won't sag for a decade, brand-backed service networks, and chairs specifically designed through human physiology research programs. For 2-4 hours of daily sitting, a $300 chair is adequate. For 6-8 hours daily over 10 years, the $1,000 chair is a value proposition when amortized." },
  { q: "How long should an office chair under $300 last?", a: "With a 3-year warranty, manufacturers commit to 3 years. Most quality chairs in this tier (Branch, SIHOO, NOUHAUS) will function well for 4 to 7 years with normal daily use under 250 lbs. Budget chairs under $200 may show cushion compression and mechanism loosening within 2 to 3 years. The Branch's 7-year warranty is exceptional and the build reflects that commitment." },
  { q: "Should I buy an office chair online without trying it?", a: "Most office chairs are purchased online without testing. The most important spec you can verify remotely is seat height range against your own sitting height - measure from the floor to your knee bend with your feet flat and compare to the chair's minimum height spec. Lumbar position can be somewhat verified by checking the adjustable height range and your L4/L5 height from the seat. For most users, a properly specified chair from a brand with a return policy is an acceptable online purchase." },
  { q: "Is it worth spending $300 on a chair for occasional use?", a: "For occasional use of 1 to 2 hours daily, a $100 to $150 basic ergonomic chair with adjustable height and lumbar is sufficient. The value of spending $300 increases with hours of daily use - at 6-plus hours, the ergonomic difference becomes significant enough to affect productivity and physical wellbeing. At 1 to 2 hours daily, the difference between a $150 and $300 chair is hard to feel." },
