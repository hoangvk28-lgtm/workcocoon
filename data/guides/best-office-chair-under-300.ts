  {
    "criterion": "Match seat height range to your actual desk height, not a generic range",
    "explanation": "A chair's seat height range only matters relative to your specific desk: if the desk sits high and the chair's range tops out too low, your knees end up above your hips no matter how good the chair otherwise is.\n\nThis matters most for taller or shorter users and for desks that aren't standard 29\"-30\" height, where a \"universal\" seat height range can quietly rule a chair out.\n\nMeasure your desk's underside clearance and compare it directly against the chair's listed seat height range before ordering, not just its marketing category (\"tall\", \"standard\", etc.)."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check seat depth adjustment, not just seat height",
    "explanation": "Seat depth, how far the seat pan extends from the backrest to the front edge, determines whether your knees clear the seat edge with your back against the lumbar support, and a fixed seat depth that's wrong for your leg length forces a choice between back support and knee comfort.\n\nThis matters more for shorter and taller users than for average-height users, since seat depth is usually tuned for a middle-of-the-road leg length by default.\n\nCheck whether seat depth is adjustable (a sliding seat pan) versus fixed, and if fixed, compare the listed depth against your own thigh length measured while seated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the weight capacity has real margin, not just enough",
    "explanation": "A chair rated at exactly your body weight is being used at the edge of its rated capacity every day, which accelerates wear on the gas cylinder, base, and mechanism well before a chair rated with 25-30% of headroom would show the same wear.\n\nThis matters for daily, all-day use specifically; an occasional-use guest chair can run closer to its rated limit without the same long-term consequence.\n\nCompare your body weight against the chair's rated capacity and favor a chair with meaningful headroom above your weight, not one that's merely rated \"enough.\""
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand what the material actually trades off, not just how it looks",
    "explanation": "Mesh backs breathe better and resist long-term sagging but transmit less lumbar contour than a padded back; PU leather and bonded leather look and feel premium initially but can crack or peel years before a mesh or fabric back shows equivalent wear; fabric splits the difference at the cost of showing stains more easily.\n\nThis matters differently depending on climate and how many hours you sit daily, heat and humidity make mesh's breathability matter more, while frequent guests or pets make stain-resistant fabric or wipeable PU more relevant.\n\nWeigh material against your actual daily-use conditions rather than defaulting to whichever material looks most premium in photos."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check what's actually adjustable versus just present",
    "explanation": "Many chairs list \"adjustable armrests\" or \"adjustable lumbar\" without specifying how many axes of adjustment exist, a 2D armrest only moves up/down, while a 4D armrest also moves in/out and pivots, and the practical difference is significant for anyone whose desk setup isn't a standard straight-on typing position.\n\nThis matters most for users with a specific ergonomic need (a keyboard tray, a monitor arm at an angle, or an existing back condition) where generic adjustability isn't enough.\n\nCheck the specific number of adjustment axes listed for armrests and lumbar support, not just the word \"adjustable\" on its own."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Can you get a genuinely ergonomic office chair under $300?", a: "Yes, with realistic expectations. The Branch Ergonomic Chair ($299) includes lumbar height and depth adjustment, 4D armrests, and adjustable seat depth - features that premium chairs at $700 also include. The trade-offs at $300 are typically shorter warranty, less premium mesh quality, and no brand cache. The ergonomic function for preventing back strain during 6-8 hour workdays is real at this price, not just marketing." },
  { q: "What is the difference between a $300 chair and a $1,000 chair?", a: "At $300: adjustable lumbar, breathable mesh, 3-4D armrests, 3-7 year warranty. At $1,000: LiveBack adaptive spines (Steelcase), PostureFit SL dual-point lumbar (Herman Miller), 12-15 year warranty, significantly better mesh quality that won't sag for a decade, brand-backed service networks, and chairs specifically designed through human physiology research programs. For 2-4 hours of daily sitting, a $300 chair is adequate. For 6-8 hours daily over 10 years, the $1,000 chair is a value proposition when amortized." },
  { q: "How long should an office chair under $300 last?", a: "With a 3-year warranty, manufacturers commit to 3 years. Most quality chairs in this tier (Branch, SIHOO, NOUHAUS) will function well for 4 to 7 years with normal daily use under 250 lbs. Budget chairs under $200 may show cushion compression and mechanism loosening within 2 to 3 years. The Branch's 7-year warranty is exceptional and the build reflects that commitment." },
  { q: "Should I buy an office chair online without trying it?", a: "Most office chairs are purchased online without testing. The most important spec you can verify remotely is seat height range against your own sitting height - measure from the floor to your knee bend with your feet flat and compare to the chair's minimum height spec. Lumbar position can be somewhat verified by checking the adjustable height range and your L4/L5 height from the seat. For most users, a properly specified chair from a brand with a return policy is an acceptable online purchase." },
  { q: "Is it worth spending $300 on a chair for occasional use?", a: "For occasional use of 1 to 2 hours daily, a $100 to $150 basic ergonomic chair with adjustable height and lumbar is sufficient. The value of spending $300 increases with hours of daily use - at 6-plus hours, the ergonomic difference becomes significant enough to affect productivity and physical wellbeing. At 1 to 2 hours daily, the difference between a $150 and $300 chair is hard to feel." },
