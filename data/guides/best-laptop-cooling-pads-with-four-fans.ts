  "We set out to build this guide the same way we built our two, three, five, and six fan guides: check every candidate pad's actual feature text against its marketed fan count, and only keep pads that genuinely confirm the number in the title. For four fans specifically, that check came back empty. Every pad we reviewed that mentions four fans in its configuration actually totals a different number once you read the full spec, most commonly five fans built from four large fans plus one smaller center fan, or a fan count of three or six entirely.",
  "Rather than stretch the definition or list pads that do not genuinely match, we are reporting that honestly. Below we cover the two closest documented configurations, one just under four fans and one just over, so readers searching specifically for a four-fan pad can make an informed choice between stepping down to three or up to a five-fan design that is built around four primary fans plus a smaller support fan.",

    description: "To be transparent upfront, this pad's listing states five total fans, one small center fan flanked by four larger fans on the sides. It is not a genuine four-fan product, but the four large fans do the majority of the cooling work, with the small center fan functioning more as a support unit than an equal fifth fan.\n\nIt earns the top spot in this comparison over TECKNET Laptop Cooling Pad for one main reason. Four large fans provide the primary airflow, closest available match to a four-fan design. On price, it comes in below TECKNET Laptop Cooling Pad, which is worth weighing if cost is your deciding factor between the two.\n\nWorth knowing before you decide: 5 adjustable height settings.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the pad's stated compatible size range against your laptop's real footprint, not its screen size",
    "explanation": "A laptop's advertised screen size, like 13 or 15.6 inches, describes the diagonal measurement of the display panel, not the physical width and depth of the laptop's base that actually sits on top of a cooling pad, and two laptops with the identical screen size can have meaningfully different base dimensions depending on bezel thickness and chassis design.\n\nCooling pad listings state a compatible size range in inches specifically because they're describing what base footprint fits their surface and fan layout, so treating the screen-size number alone as a fit guarantee is a genuine buying mistake, not just an imprecise shortcut.\n\nMeasure your laptop's actual width and depth, or find those dimensions in its own spec sheet, and compare that against the pad's stated range rather than matching screen-size numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that a wider-range pad isn't automatically better for a smaller laptop",
    "explanation": "Cooling pads spread their fans across the surface in a fixed layout designed around the middle of their stated compatible range, so a pad rated for 12 to 17 inches has its fans positioned to reach a wide variety of vent locations across that whole span, while a laptop toward the small end of that range may not sit directly over as many of those fans as it would on a pad sized more tightly around its own dimensions.\n\nThis matters because the cooling benefit of a pad comes specifically from airflow reaching the laptop's actual intake vents, not from the pad's overall surface area, so a smaller laptop on an oversized pad can genuinely get less effective cooling than the same laptop on a proportionally sized pad, despite technically fitting within the stated range.\n\nWhen your laptop sits toward one end of a pad's stated range rather than the middle, check user photos or reviews specifically describing that size laptop's fit before assuming the airflow lines up well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your laptop's actual vent location and design, especially for thin ultrabooks and MacBooks",
    "explanation": "Most cooling pads are designed around bottom-vented laptops, where intake vents sit on the underside of the chassis directly facing the pad's fans, but some laptops, most notably many MacBook models, use a fully sealed or fanless internal design where the chassis itself acts as a heat sink rather than relying on active airflow from underneath.\n\nThis is a genuine compatibility gap that a cooling pad's stated inch-range compatibility says nothing about, since a pad can physically fit a MacBook's exact footprint while providing essentially no cooling benefit if that specific model has no bottom vents for the fans to blow into.\n\nCheck your specific laptop model's actual cooling design (vented bottom panel versus sealed unibody) before assuming a cooling pad will meaningfully lower its temperature, and treat this as a separate question from simple physical size fit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh fan count and noise level together, not fan count alone",
    "explanation": "A pad's fan count, commonly ranging from a single central fan up to five or six smaller fans, is often marketed as a straightforward better-is-more spec, but more fans spinning simultaneously generally means more total noise output, and a pad with independently controllable fan zones lets you balance airflow against noise rather than forcing an all-or-nothing choice.\n\nThis is a real everyday tradeoff for anyone using a laptop in a quiet room or on a video call, since a cooling pad running at full multi-fan speed can become audible enough to be distracting, undermining the benefit if you end up turning it off to avoid the noise.\n\nCheck whether the listing states selectable fan modes or independently controlled fan zones, not just the total fan count, if noise control matters to your specific environment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the power source and port type match your laptop before assuming plug-and-play compatibility",
    "explanation": "Nearly all cooling pads draw power over a USB cable rather than a separate power adapter, which keeps setup simple, but the cable end that plugs into your laptop is typically USB-A, and a laptop with only USB-C ports (common on newer ultrabooks and MacBooks) will need a separate USB-C adapter or hub to actually power the pad, an extra cost and cable that isn't obvious from the listing photos alone.\n\nThis matters because a cooling pad that can't be powered defeats its entire purpose regardless of how well it otherwise fits your laptop's size and vent layout, so it's a genuine prerequisite to check, not an afterthought.\n\nCheck the listing's stated cable connector type and confirm it matches an available port on your specific laptop, or budget for an adapter if it doesn't."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Are there any laptop cooling pads with exactly four fans?", a: "We could not verify one in the current market data we checked. Every candidate pad marketed near a four-fan configuration actually stated a different total, most often five fans built from four large fans plus one small support fan, or six and nine-fan designs." },
  { q: "Is the AIMIUZI pad really a four-fan pad?", a: "No. Its listing states five total fans, four large fans plus one small center fan. We include it here as the closest functional match since the four large fans do most of the cooling work, but we do not represent it as a genuine four-fan product." },
  { q: "Should I buy a 3-fan or a 5-fan pad instead?", a: "It depends on your workload. The confirmed 3-fan TECKNET pick above suits lighter use, while the 5-fan AIMIUZI pick, with its four large primary fans, suits buyers who want more airflow closer to what a four-fan design would offer." },
  { q: "Why do so many listings market fan counts inconsistently?", a: "Manufacturers sometimes use fan icons or marketing copy that does not match the literal count in the feature bullets. Always cross-check the written specs rather than relying on the product title or main image alone." },
  { q: "Will this guide be updated if a genuine four-fan pad becomes available?", a: "Yes. If a listing verifiably confirms an exact four-fan configuration in future research, we will update this guide to include it rather than continuing to rely on close substitutes." },
