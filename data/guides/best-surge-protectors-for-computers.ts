export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the disclosed joule rating, not just the word \"surge protector\"",
    "explanation": "A joule rating measures how much total surge energy a device can absorb before it needs replacing, and plenty of products marketed simply as a \"power strip\" or \"surge protector\" either omit this number entirely or bury it deep in the specs.\n\nThis matters because a device with no real joule rating, or a very low one under 600, may offer only minimal protection, essentially a glorified extension cord with a marketing label, while a legitimate surge protector for computer or home-office equipment typically starts around 1000 to 2000 joules or higher.\n\nLook for the specific joule number stated in the listing title or bullet points, and treat any listing that only says \"surge protection\" with no number attached as a red flag."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match outlet count and spacing to what you're actually plugging in",
    "explanation": "The number of outlets on the spec sheet doesn't tell the whole story, spacing between outlets matters just as much, since bulky wall adapters or power bricks for a monitor, printer, or charger can block adjacent outlets even on a strip that technically has enough slots.\n\nThis is a common real-world frustration where a 6-outlet strip effectively becomes a 3 or 4-outlet strip once actual devices are plugged in.\n\nCheck product photos and reviews for outlet spacing specifically, and count how many bulky adapters you'll actually need to plug in side by side before assuming the listed outlet count covers your setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify UL listing, since surge protection claims aren't self-certifying",
    "explanation": "UL (Underwriters Laboratories) certification is an independent third-party safety and performance verification, not a marketing claim a manufacturer can just assert on its own.\n\nA genuine surge protector should carry UL 1449 certification specifically, the standard for surge protective devices, distinct from a basic UL listing that only covers general electrical safety without verifying surge performance. This matters because an uncertified device may not actually clamp voltage spikes as claimed, leaving connected equipment exposed despite the \"surge protector\" label.\n\nCheck the listing or product photos for a UL 1449 mark specifically, not just a generic UL logo."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider USB ports and their combined wattage, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A strip listing 4 USB ports doesn't guarantee those ports can charge 4 devices at full speed simultaneously, the ports typically share a combined wattage budget, so charging speed can drop noticeably when multiple devices draw power at once.\n\nThis matters more if you regularly charge a phone, tablet, and other device all at the same time from the same strip, versus occasional single-device charging.\n\nCheck the listing for total USB output in watts, not just the port count, and compare that figure against your devices' actual charging requirements if fast charging matters to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the warranty and connected-equipment protection guarantee",
    "explanation": "Many legitimate surge protectors back their protection with a manufacturer's connected-equipment warranty, a dollar-amount guarantee to cover damage to plugged-in devices if the surge protector fails to do its job.\n\nThis is a meaningfully stronger signal of manufacturer confidence than a basic product warranty covering only the strip itself, since it puts real money behind the surge-protection claim.\n\nCheck the listing for a specific connected-equipment warranty amount and duration, and treat the absence of one as a sign the surge protection claim may be more marketing than substance."
