export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "What does a 2-bay NAS actually cost once you add drives?",
    a: "A diskless 2-bay NAS around $200 plus two 4TB drives at roughly $100 each puts the true cost near $400 before any setup. If you're buying a 2.5GbE model, budget an additional $40-80 for a compatible router or switch if you don't already have one, since 2.5GbE speed gains require both ends of the connection to support it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does RAM upgradeability matter if I'm only backing up files today?",
    a: "Value-series NAS units like the Synology DS223 or Asustor Drivestor 2 ship with soldered RAM, which is fine for basic file backup but can't be expanded later. If there's any chance you'll add Plex, Surveillance Station, or run multiple containers down the road, a Plus-series model with upgradeable DDR4 like the Synology DS725+ avoids an early forced upgrade to a new unit.",
  },
  {
    q: "If I buy 2x 4TB drives for RAID 1, do I get 8TB of usable storage?",
    a: "No. RAID 1 mirrors data across both drives for redundancy, so 2x 4TB gives you 4TB usable, not 8TB. If you need 8TB of usable space, you'd need either JBOD with no redundancy protection or a 4-bay NAS with a different RAID configuration.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need Synology-branded drives for a Synology NAS?",
    a: "Not strictly, but Synology's 2024+ Plus-series models, including units like the DS725+, show compatibility warnings for non-Synology-branded drives even when those drives function correctly. Synology-branded drives avoid the warning entirely but typically cost 15-30% more than equivalent third-party drives.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 2-bay NAS overkill if I just need automatic backup for one computer?",
    a: "For a single user with no redundancy requirement, a simpler single-drive, cloud-connected NAS with no RAID and no separate drive purchase is often a better fit. A traditional diskless 2-bay NAS earns its complexity once you have multiple users, want drive redundancy, or plan to run additional apps like Plex.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which 2-bay NAS in this list is best if I might add Plex later?",
    a: "The QNAP TS-264-8G-US ships with 8GB of RAM included, which covers Plex and several other apps without an upgrade purchase. The Synology DS725+ is the other strong option since its DDR4 RAM is upgradeable even though it ships with less RAM out of the box.",
