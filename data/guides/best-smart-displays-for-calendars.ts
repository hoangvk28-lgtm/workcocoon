It runs Google Assistant instead of Alexa, a real difference if your calendar and reminders already live in a Google account.\n\nThe compact size and lack of camera make it well suited to a desk or nightstand where a lens pointed at you is unwelcome, though it also means it cannot do Alexa-style video calling that the Echo Show models support. It also ships in a lighter Chalk color option for buyers who prefer that finish.\n\nCompact 7 inch size fits small spaces easily.

    "criterion": "Decide whether a built-in camera is a feature or a privacy concern for your desk",
    "explanation": "Some smart displays include a front-facing camera for casual video calls or as a security-camera-style monitor, while others are explicitly camera-free by design, marketed specifically for privacy-conscious buyers who don't want a camera pointed at their workspace all day.\n\nThis distinction matters directly depending on your actual use case, a camera is genuinely useful if you'll use the display for video calls, but it's a real consideration if the display sits on a desk where you'd rather not have an always-on camera present, even one you can physically cover.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for camera presence or absence, and check whether a physical camera shutter or cover is included if privacy matters to you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match screen size to your actual desk space and how much information you want at a glance",
    "explanation": "A smaller 5-7 inch display fits easily beside a keyboard without blocking your monitor or eating meaningful desk space, but shows less information at a glance, calendar, weather, and notifications compete for limited screen real estate, while a larger 8-10 inch display shows considerably more at once but demands more desk real estate and can start competing visually with your main monitor.\n\nThis matters more the tighter your desk space actually is, and more the more you plan to rely on the display as a genuine information hub versus a simple clock and notification glance.\n\nCheck the listed screen size in inches against your actual available desk space, not just the general size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your voice assistant ecosystem before buying, since Alexa and Google Assistant aren't interchangeable",
    "explanation": "Smart displays are built around one specific voice assistant ecosystem, either Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant, and each integrates differently with different smart home devices, calendar services, and existing voice assistant hardware, so a display built for the ecosystem you don't already use can mean losing compatibility with smart home devices or routines you've already set up.\n\nThis matters directly if you already own other smart home devices or use a specific calendar service regularly, checking ecosystem compatibility before buying avoids a real functionality gap after purchase.\n\nCheck which ecosystem, Alexa or Google Assistant, the display uses, and confirm it matches what your other smart home devices and calendar service actually support."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider display motorization if the display needs to track you around the desk",
    "explanation": "A small number of smart displays include a motorized base that automatically rotates or tracks a person's position during a video call, keeping you framed in view even if you move around while working, a genuinely useful feature for anyone who moves between multiple monitors or stands up periodically during calls, but an added cost and complexity that's wasted if you sit relatively still.\n\nThis matters more for anyone with a multi-monitor setup who shifts position frequently during calls, less for a single fixed desk position.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for motorized tracking as a named feature, and weigh its added cost against how much you'd actually benefit from it given your desk setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh audio quality if the display will also serve as a music or podcast speaker",
    "explanation": "Speaker quality varies meaningfully between smart display models even within the same product line, some prioritize a compact footprint at the cost of thinner, tinnier sound, while others include genuinely improved bass and clarity as a specific upgrade.\n\nThis matters more if you plan to actually use the display as your primary desk speaker for music, podcasts, or calls throughout the day, less if audio is a secondary consideration behind the visual display itself.\n\nCheck reviews and the listing specifically for audio quality mentions, not just screen specs, if sound quality is a real factor in your decision."
