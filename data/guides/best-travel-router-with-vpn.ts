export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Stated VPN Throughput Numbers Vary Dramatically Between Similarly Priced Travel Routers",
    "explanation": "The routers in this comparison range from a stated 28 Mbps OpenVPN ceiling up to 150-300 Mbps, meaning two travel routers with VPN support can perform very differently once you're actually routing traffic through an encrypted tunnel, since VPN encryption itself consumes processing power that a weaker router chip struggles to keep up with at higher speeds. This matters significantly if you plan to video call, stream, or transfer large files while connected through the VPN, and matters much less if you're primarily just browsing and checking email. Check a router's specifically stated OpenVPN and WireGuard maximum speeds, not just whether it supports VPN at all, before assuming any VPN-capable travel router performs similarly under real load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A VPN Kill Switch Prevents a Real, Common Failure Mode Where Your Traffic Silently Reverts to Unprotected",
    "explanation": "Without a kill switch, if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, whether from a temporary network hiccup or overloaded VPN server, your traffic can silently continue flowing over the unprotected underlying connection without any obvious warning, potentially exposing sensitive data on that hotel or public network. This matters significantly for business travelers handling sensitive data who want a guarantee that no traffic ever escapes VPN protection, and matters less for casual travelers doing basic browsing where an occasional brief unprotected moment carries lower real risk. Check specifically whether a travel router's listing mentions a VPN kill switch feature if guaranteed protection matters more to you than convenience."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VPN Client and Server Capability Together Enables a Genuinely Different Use Case Than Client-Only Support",
    "explanation": "A router that only supports VPN client mode lets you connect to your existing VPN provider's servers, while a router that also supports VPN server mode lets you turn the tables and remotely access your home network's own resources, like files or a home security camera, from anywhere while traveling. This matters if you specifically want to reach back into your home network while away, and matters less if your only goal is protecting your traffic through a commercial VPN provider while traveling. Check whether a listing specifically states both client and server capability if remote access back to your home network is part of your use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Site VPN Routing Policies Let You Balance Security and Speed Rather Than an All-or-Nothing Approach",
    "explanation": "A router offering granular VPN routing policies lets you route specific websites or services through the VPN tunnel while other traffic bypasses it and uses the regular, typically faster, unencrypted connection, rather than forcing every single byte of traffic through the VPN regardless of whether that specific site needs the protection. This matters if you want to reserve VPN bandwidth for genuinely sensitive activities like banking while letting bandwidth-heavy but lower-risk activities like streaming run at full unencrypted speed, and matters less if you prefer the simplicity of an all-traffic VPN approach. Consider a router with stated per-site VPN policy support if you want this kind of speed-versus-security balance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A VPN Router's Physical Size and Weight Matter More the More Frequently and Lightly You Travel",
    "explanation": "The lightest routers in this comparison weigh just 39 grams, dramatically less than the full-featured picks, and for a frequent flyer already managing carry-on weight and space limits, this difference genuinely matters, while a less frequent traveler or someone driving to their destination may not weigh this factor as heavily. This matters more if you're optimizing a minimalist travel setup or flying frequently with strict luggage constraints, and matters less for occasional trips where a slightly larger router is easily accommodated. Weigh your actual travel frequency and luggage constraints against how much a router's size and weight should influence your choice relative to its VPN performance."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need to pay for a separate VPN subscription to use these travel routers' VPN features?", "a": "Yes, these routers come with VPN client software pre-installed, but you still need an active subscription with a compatible VPN service provider to actually use the VPN connection." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between OpenVPN and WireGuard on a travel router?", "a": "WireGuard is a newer VPN protocol that typically delivers faster speeds and lower overhead than OpenVPN, though OpenVPN remains widely supported and compatible with more VPN providers in some cases." },
  { "q": "Is a VPN kill switch necessary for casual travel use?", "a": "It's most valuable for business travelers handling sensitive data who want a guarantee against unprotected traffic; casual browsing carries lower risk if a brief connection drop occasionally exposes unencrypted traffic." },
  { "q": "Can a travel router with VPN also access my home network remotely?", "a": "Only if it specifically supports VPN server mode in addition to client mode, letting you connect back into your home network's VPN server to access files or devices while traveling." },
  { "q": "Why do VPN speeds vary so much between similarly priced travel routers?", "a": "VPN encryption requires real processing power, and routers with weaker or older processor chips struggle to maintain high throughput once encryption overhead is added, even if their raw Wi-Fi speed rating looks similar on paper." },
  { "q": "Is a 28 Mbps OpenVPN speed too slow for travel use?", "a": "It's sufficient for basic browsing and email, but noticeably limiting for video calls or streaming through the VPN tunnel, so match your router's stated speed to your actual planned VPN usage." }
