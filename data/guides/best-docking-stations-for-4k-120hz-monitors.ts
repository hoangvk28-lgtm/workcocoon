  "Getting a genuine 4K@120Hz signal out of a docking station depends on more than the dock's marketing spec sheet. Thunderbolt 4's 40Gbps bandwidth cannot carry uncompressed 4K@120Hz on its own, docks that hit that refresh rate rely on Display Stream Compression (DSC), which needs support on both the dock and the monitor to actually work, while DisplayLink docks take a different compression path that has its own platform limits.",
  "Below are 8 docking stations we evaluated for their ability to actually drive 4K at high refresh rates, from Thunderbolt docks built for MacBook and Windows laptops to DisplayLink hubs and KVM switch docks for multi-computer desks. Each entry notes exactly what refresh rate and compression path it uses, since a dock rated for 4K@120Hz on one connection type often can't reach that same number on another.",

  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

  {
    q: "Can Thunderbolt 4 actually run a 4K@120Hz monitor?",
    a: "Thunderbolt 4's 40Gbps bandwidth is not enough to carry an uncompressed 4K@120Hz signal. Docks that reach 4K@120Hz over TB4 do it through Display Stream Compression (DSC), a visually lossless method that fits the signal within TB4's bandwidth. DSC requires support on both the dock and the connected monitor, so check your monitor's spec sheet for DSC support before assuming a TB4 dock will hit 120Hz.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Thunderbolt 5 make a difference for 4K@120Hz?",
    a: "Yes, Thunderbolt 5 has enough bandwidth to carry 4K@120Hz uncompressed, without relying on DSC at all. As of 2026, TB5 laptops are still less common and TB5 docks tend to cost more, so most buyers are choosing between a DSC-compressed TB4 connection, which most people can't visually distinguish from uncompressed, or paying the TB5 premium.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is my monitor stuck at 60Hz even though my dock supports 120Hz?",
    a: "The most common cause is the display cable, an older HDMI cable simply cannot carry a 4K@120Hz signal and will silently cap the connection at 4K@60Hz even if the dock and monitor both support 120Hz. Confirm you're using a certified high-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort cable, and also check that your specific monitor input supports DSC if the dock relies on it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose 4K@120Hz or 1440p@144Hz for my setup?",
    a: "It depends on your use case. For home office productivity work with mostly static content, 4K@60Hz is often visually superior to 1440p@144Hz simply due to the resolution jump. For gaming on a mid-range GPU, 1440p@144Hz can deliver smoother real gameplay than a 4K@120Hz target the GPU can't consistently sustain, so match the choice to whether you're optimizing for clarity or frame rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a MacBook run a dock at 4K@120Hz?",
    a: "Not through a DisplayLink-based dock, DisplayLink's compression caps macOS output at 4K@60Hz regardless of what the dock advertises for Windows. Reaching 4K@120Hz on a MacBook requires a dock with native Thunderbolt video output, and even then only higher-tier Pro or Max chip MacBooks support that output at 120Hz.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the point of a KVM switch dock versus a regular docking station?",
    a: "A KVM switch dock lets 2 separate computers, like a work laptop and a personal desktop, share the same monitors and peripherals without physically re-plugging cables each time you switch machines. If you only ever connect one computer, a standard dock without KVM switching is simpler and typically cheaper for equivalent display performance.",
