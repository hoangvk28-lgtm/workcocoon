    "criterion": "Remember every listed NAS here is diskless, budget drives separately",
    "explanation": "The price shown for a NAS enclosure covers the hardware chassis, CPU, and RAM only, not the actual storage drives, NAS-grade drives built for 24/7 operation like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red still need to be budgeted on top, often adding $80 to $200 or more per bay depending on capacity and drive type.\n\nThis matters because comparing NAS units purely by enclosure price without factoring in drive cost gives a misleading picture of the real total investment, a cheaper enclosure with more bays to fill can end up costing more overall than a pricier enclosure with fewer bays.\n\nCheck whether a listing is diskless or ships with drives included, and add realistic per-bay drive costs to the enclosure price before comparing total cost across options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh CPU class and RAM over bay count for real day-to-day performance",
    "explanation": "Bay count determines maximum storage capacity, but CPU architecture (Intel, AMD, or ARM) and RAM amount determine how well the NAS actually handles real workloads, running apps, transcoding media on the fly, or serving multiple simultaneous users, and a higher bay count with a weak CPU can bottleneck performance regardless of how much raw storage it holds.\n\nThis matters more the more the NAS will do beyond simple file storage, like Plex transcoding or running multiple docker containers, less if it's purely a basic backup target.\n\nCheck the specific CPU model and RAM amount (and whether RAM is upgradeable) rather than choosing primarily by bay count."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand RAID as a rebuild-time safety net, not a substitute for real backup",
    "explanation": "RAID configurations protect against a single drive failure by letting the array rebuild from redundant data, but RAID is not a backup, it does nothing to protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, theft, fire, or a controller failure that affects the whole array at once.\n\nThis distinction matters because treating RAID redundancy as sufficient backup protection is a common and genuinely risky misunderstanding, a real backup strategy needs a copy of critical data stored somewhere physically separate from the NAS itself.\n\nCheck what RAID level a given NAS supports, and separately plan an actual backup strategy, ideally following a 3-2-1 approach, rather than relying on RAID redundancy alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match drive type (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) to your actual access pattern",
    "explanation": "Traditional hard drives offer the lowest cost per terabyte for bulk storage like media libraries or backups, while SSD or NVMe-based NAS storage costs significantly more per terabyte but delivers much faster random access speeds, genuinely useful for frequently-accessed files, active project work, or serving as a fast cache tier.\n\nThis matters directly based on how you'll actually use the storage, a media library accessed sequentially benefits little from SSD speed, while an active working file share benefits considerably.\n\nCheck whether the NAS supports the drive type you need, and weigh the real cost-per-terabyte difference against how much you'll actually benefit from faster random access."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider noise level if the NAS will run continuously in a shared living or office space",
    "explanation": "A NAS that runs 24/7 generates continuous fan and drive noise, and that noise profile varies meaningfully between models, some use larger, slower-spinning fans that stay genuinely quiet, while others rely on smaller, faster fans that produce a persistent whine noticeable in a quiet room.\n\nThis matters a great deal if the NAS will sit in a bedroom, living room, or shared home office rather than a dedicated closet or basement out of earshot.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world noise level mentions during continuous operation, not just idle noise, since drive activity and fan speed both increase under load."

    q: "Do I need to buy hard drives separately for these NAS units?",
    a: "Yes, for every pick in this guide except the BUFFALO LinkStation 720, which ships with 4TB of drives already installed. The other 7 picks are diskless, and NAS-grade drives like Seagate IronWolf or WD Red typically add $80-200 per bay, so plan for that cost on top of the enclosure price.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it actually take to set up a home NAS?",
    a: "Realistically 2-4 hours minimum for a first-time setup, covering drive installation, DSM or OS configuration, RAID setup, and remote access configuration. This is a real computer you're configuring, not a plug-and-play USB external drive, so budget a real block of time rather than expecting it to work the moment it's connected.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is RAID the same as a backup?",
    a: "No. RAID only protects against a single drive failing, it does nothing against accidental deletion, ransomware, or the NAS itself being lost, stolen, or damaged. The 3-2-1 backup rule, 3 copies of your data on 2 different media types with 1 copy offsite, is the actual safety net, and your NAS should be one piece of that plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which of these NAS units can handle 4K video transcoding for Plex?",
    a: "The Intel-based picks, the Synology DS225+, UGREEN NAS DXP2800, and Asustor AS5402T, handle hardware 4K transcoding smoothly. The ARM-based QNAP TS-233-US and other budget-tier units handle basic file storage fine but will stutter or fail at 4K transcoding, so pick your CPU tier based on whether streaming is a priority.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a 2.5GbE NAS actually give me faster speeds at home?",
    a: "Only if your network supports it. Most home routers only have 1GbE ports, a theoretical max of about 125MB/s, so a 2.5GbE NAS like the Asustor AS5402T won't show its real speed advantage unless you also upgrade to a 2.5GbE switch. Without that upgrade, the faster port goes unused.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a NAS worth it for a small home office?",
    a: "It depends on your data volume and number of users. If you only need backup for under 2TB of data, a cheap monthly cloud subscription is usually more cost-effective than a $300-700 NAS. A NAS starts to make more sense once you have multiple users, more than about 5TB of data, or want local-network speed and privacy rather than relying entirely on a cloud provider.",
