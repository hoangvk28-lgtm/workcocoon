  "A 100 inch TV is a different category of purchase than a 65 or 75 inch screen, and the stand underneath it needs to match that scale. The panel itself can weigh anywhere from 100 to over 150 lbs before you add a soundbar, streaming box, or gaming console, so a stated weight capacity that only clears the TV by a slim margin is a real risk rather than a formality.",
  "Width matters just as much as capacity. A 100 inch TV measures roughly 87 inches diagonally corner to corner, so a stand under about 90 inches wide will visually and physically undersize the screen. The eight stands below range from fixed 90+ inch consoles to one extendable design, with several including built-in electric fireplaces for buyers who want to combine media storage with a heat source.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "How wide should a TV stand be for a 100 inch TV?",
    a: "A 100 inch TV's screen measures roughly 87 inches diagonally corner to corner, so a stand between 90 and 98 inches wide gives comfortable overhang on both sides. Going narrower than 90 inches can leave the TV looking oversized for its base and reduces the stand's practical stability margin.",
  },
  {
    q: "What weight capacity do I need for a 100 inch TV stand?",
    a: "Most 100 inch TVs weigh between 100 and 150+ lbs before adding a soundbar or streaming devices, so look for a stand rated well above that figure rather than right at it. A stated capacity of 150 to 187 lbs or higher gives a safer working margin once accessories are added on top.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do fireplace TV stands require extra assembly work?",
    a: "Yes. The electric fireplace insert typically ships as a separate component inside the console's shipping box rather than pre-installed, which means wiring and mounting it into the frame is an added step beyond assembling the console itself. Plan for more assembly time than a stand without a fireplace.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I anchor a TV stand to the wall for a 100 inch TV?",
    a: "Yes, anti-tip anchoring is strongly recommended for any freestanding stand holding a screen this large. The combination of a heavy panel and a mounting point that sits several feet off the floor increases tipping leverage, so a wall strap or bracket engaged into a stud adds a meaningful layer of safety.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an extendable TV stand a good choice for a 100 inch TV?",
    a: "An extendable stand can be a good option if you're planning to upgrade to a 100 inch TV later but currently own a smaller screen, since it avoids buying two separate consoles. At full extension the width margin is typically tighter than a comparable fixed-width stand, so measure your specific TV before relying on the maximum extended width.",
