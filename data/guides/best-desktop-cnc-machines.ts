Auto probing and surface leveling calibrate the workpiece before each cut, which matters more than raw spindle speed on uneven stock.\n\nSpindle runout under 0.0004 in and motor resolution of 0.0002 in are real, documented figures rather than a vague accuracy claim.

  },
  {
    "q": "Should I prioritize price or capability when choosing desktop cnc machines?",
    "a": "Capability first, since a machine that can't handle your intended materials or projects won't become more useful for being cheaper. Narrow the field by real capability, then compare price among the finalists."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
