    "explanation": "Listings for a chair mat often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the chair mat holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this chair mat over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any chair mat you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A chair mat that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "Is there a chair mat rated for extra-high pile or padded carpet?",
    a: "Yes, the ES Robbins Extra High Pile Chair Mat with Lip is the only pick in this guide rated for extra-high pile carpet over 1 inch, including padding. Most other chair mats, including the other picks here, only cover low to medium pile.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between the 2 ES Robbins mats in this guide?",
    a: "The ES Robbins EverLife is rated for medium pile carpet up to 3/4 inch in a large 60x72 commercial footprint with a lifetime 'No Crack' warranty. The ES Robbins Extra High Pile pick is smaller at 36x48 but is the only mat in this guide rated for extra-high pile carpet over 1 inch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do tempered glass mats need a pile-height rating?",
    a: "Not in the same way vinyl or polycarbonate mats do. Because glass stays rigid and doesn't sink into carpet, picks like the Lorell and GLSLAND tempered glass mats in this guide work across a range of pile heights without a specific ceiling, though they come at a higher price and heavier weight.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the ES Robbins EverLife have a lower star rating than the cheaper picks in this guide?",
    a: "It sits at 3.8 stars, the lowest in this guide, despite its commercial-grade certifications and lifetime warranty. A lower average rating doesn't necessarily mean lower build quality, it can also reflect a larger, heavier, pricier product with higher buyer expectations, so weigh it alongside the mat's actual spec sheet.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a rolled chair mat take to lie flat?",
    a: "Around 24 hours lying flat at room temperature. Most 'my mat won't stay flat' complaints in the first day are just this normal settling period, not a defect.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which pick in this guide is best if I want the mat to look decorative rather than utilitarian?",
    a: "The Anji Mountain Rug'd Jacquard Office Chair Mat is the only pick here that looks like a woven decorative rug rather than a plastic or glass mat, while still being rated for low pile carpet or hard surfaces.",
