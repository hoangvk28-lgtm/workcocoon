export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Extend Mode and Mirror Mode Serve Genuinely Different Purposes on a Dual-Monitor KVM Switch",
    "explanation": "Extend mode lets each of your two monitors show different content, effectively giving you the same expanded desktop experience you'd have with monitors plugged directly into one computer, while mirror mode duplicates the identical image on both screens, useful mainly for presentations or a shared secondary display. Before choosing a dual-monitor KVM switch, confirm it explicitly supports extend mode if that's your actual goal, since some cheaper switches marketed as \"dual monitor\" only support mirroring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Scaling to Four Computers Requires Meaningfully More Cables and Careful Graphics Card Configuration",
    "explanation": "A 4-computer KVM switch, like the pick in this comparison, requires connecting HDMI and DisplayPort cables from each of the four separate computers, and on machines with both discrete and integrated graphics cards, both video ports need to come from the discrete card specifically for the setup to work as advertised. This added complexity is worth the tradeoff only if you genuinely need to manage four separate systems regularly, not as a default choice over simpler options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A USB-C Port Alongside USB-A Ports Future-Proofs Your Peripheral Connections",
    "explanation": "Many newer peripherals, external drives, and docking accessories now use USB-C connectors, and a KVM switch offering at least one USB-C port alongside the more common USB-A ports, like several picks in this comparison, means you won't need a separate USB-C to USB-A adapter for these devices. If you've noticed more of your accessories shipping with USB-C cables recently, prioritize a switch with this port included rather than an all-USB-A design."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Two Similarly Specced Switches Can Have a Real Price Difference Worth Investigating",
    "explanation": "The UGREEN and Heravo picks in this comparison share nearly identical core specifications, dual monitor support, 4 USB 3.0 ports, 4K@60Hz, yet differ by $10 in price, generally reflecting brand recognition and stated feature details like adaptive EDID technology rather than a fundamental hardware difference. When two listings look nearly identical on paper, read the specific feature descriptions closely rather than assuming the pricier one is automatically better."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Simpler, Cheaper Options Remain Valid Even in a Comparison Focused on Dual-Monitor Switches",
    "explanation": "Not every buyer researching KVM switches in this price range actually needs dual-monitor or multi-computer support, and an established single-monitor switch like the IOGEAR pick in this comparison can serve a straightforward two-computer, one-monitor desk setup reliably for significantly less money. Resist the pull toward the most feature-rich option in a comparison if your actual daily setup doesn't require those extra capabilities."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need identical monitors for the dual-monitor extend mode to work properly?", "a": "No, the monitors don't need to be identical models, though both should support the resolution and refresh rate you intend to use, since a significant mismatch in capabilities between the two monitors could limit your overall dual-monitor experience to the lower-capability display." },
  { "q": "Can I connect a laptop to the 4-computer KVM switch if it only has one HDMI output?", "a": "For the dual-monitor 4-computer configuration, each computer typically needs 2 video outputs (HDMI and/or DisplayPort) to drive both monitors; a laptop with only a single HDMI output would need a USB-C to DisplayPort or similar adapter to provide the second video connection, if its USB-C port supports video output." },
  { "q": "What's the practical difference between the UGREEN and Heravo dual-monitor switches given their similar specs?", "a": "Based on the listings, UGREEN doesn't explicitly claim adaptive EDID technology while Heravo does, and UGREEN carries a $10 price premium likely reflecting its more established brand recognition; functionally, both deliver a similar dual-monitor, 4 USB 3.0 port experience." },
  { "q": "Is the IOGEAR switch's 1920x1200 resolution good enough for general office work?", "a": "Yes, 1920x1200 comfortably handles general office tasks like word processing, spreadsheets, web browsing, and video calls; it's only a meaningful limitation if you specifically need 4K resolution for detailed photo or video editing work." },
  { "q": "How many total cables do I need for the full 4-computer, 2-monitor KVM switch setup?", "a": "Based on the listing, each of the four computers needs both HDMI and DisplayPort connections plus a USB 3.0 cable, meaning a fully connected setup requires roughly 12 video cables plus 4 USB cables in total, a meaningfully more complex cable management task than a simple 2-computer switch." },
  { "q": "Will switching between computers on these dual-monitor KVM switches interrupt an active video call?", "a": "Yes, switching the KVM to a different computer will disconnect whatever active session (including video calls) is running on the previously active computer's displays, since the monitors, keyboard, and mouse all redirect to the newly selected computer." }
