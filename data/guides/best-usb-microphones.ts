  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the usb microphone holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",

    q: "Why does my USB microphone cut out or sound distorted through a hub?",
    a: "Many USB condenser mics don't get enough stable power through an unpowered USB hub port, which causes voltage drop and can produce dropouts or distortion that looks like a defective mic. Plug the mic directly into a USB port on the computer, or use a powered hub, before assuming the microphone itself is faulty.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a hardware mute button actually better than software mute?",
    a: "Yes, for anyone who mutes and unmutes frequently during calls. A hardware mute button on mics like the FIFINE AM8 or K688 responds instantly with no delay, while software mute through an app can lag half a second to a full second, long enough to clip the first word after you come off mute.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a USB microphone and later upgrade to XLR?",
    a: "Yes, if you buy a mic with both USB and XLR output, like the FIFINE AM8, AM8T, or K688. These work over USB now and can plug into a full audio interface or mixer later without needing to replace the microphone. A USB-only mic like the Blue Yeti Nano has no such path.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I put my USB microphone directly on the desk?",
    a: "No, not if you can help it. A mic sitting flat on the desk picks up keyboard clatter and desk vibration far more than most buyers expect, especially with a mechanical keyboard nearby. A shock mount or boom arm, like the ones included with the FIFINE AM8T, K688, and TONOR TC310+, decouples the mic from the desk surface.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a renewed USB microphone worth buying to save money?",
    a: "It can be, as long as you check the seller's return policy before purchasing. The renewed Blue Yeti in this list offers the same 4-pattern condenser flexibility as the new version at a lower price, which is a reasonable trade-off for budget-conscious buyers comfortable with refurbished electronics.",
