  "At the $200 mark, XLR audio interfaces from Audient, Universal Audio, Focusrite, and PreSonus start including genuinely studio-grade converter technology and higher headroom preamps that budget-tier interfaces simply can't match, and the differences between these picks come down to workflow details rather than raw sound quality.",
  "We compared this lineup on preamp gain range, converter dynamic range, and monitoring/mixer control design, since a higher gain range genuinely matters for low-output ribbon microphones or quiet acoustic sources that a lower-gain preamp would struggle to capture cleanly."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Vintage Preamp Emulation Is a Genuine Sonic Choice, Not an Objective Upgrade Over a Clean Preamp",
    "explanation": "The Universal Audio Volt 2's Vintage Mic Preamp mode models the specific sonic character of a classic tube preamp circuit, adding warm harmonic saturation directly to the recorded signal, while a transparent preamp like the one in the Audient iD4 MKII captures the source as accurately as possible with no added coloration. This matters based on your specific recording goals, where musicians recording vocals or instruments that benefit from warmth might prefer the vintage coloration, while podcasters or anyone doing heavy post-production processing usually benefits more from a clean, unprocessed starting signal they can shape themselves. Check whether a listing specifically states a vintage emulation mode versus a transparent preamp design before assuming all preamps in this price range sound sonically identical."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated Preamp Gain in Decibels Determines Whether a Specific Microphone Will Actually Work Well With That Interface",
    "explanation": "The Audient iD4 MKII specifically states 58dB of clean gain, a concrete figure that matters directly if you're using a low-output microphone like a ribbon mic or a dynamic mic that requires significant amplification to reach a usable recording level, since an interface with insufficient maximum gain will produce a recording that's too quiet even with the gain knob turned all the way up. This matters less if you're using a high-output condenser microphone that requires less amplification to begin with. Check the specific stated maximum gain figure in decibels for any interface you're considering, especially if you already own or plan to buy a specific microphone known for needing extra gain."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Physical Production Controller Changes Your Actual Recording Workflow, Not Just the Interface's Feature List",
    "explanation": "The PreSonus ioStation 24c's motorized fader and dedicated transport buttons let you control playback, recording, and mixing levels by physically touching hardware controls rather than clicking through DAW software with a mouse, a genuinely different physical interaction model that some users find faster and more intuitive, especially during live streaming when reaching for a mouse mid-broadcast is impractical. This matters if your workflow benefits from tactile, hands-on control, and matters less if you're comfortable and efficient with mouse-and-keyboard DAW navigation already. Consider whether you'll actually use physical hardware controls regularly before paying extra for them, since an unused fader adds cost without adding value to your specific workflow."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bundled Software Value Varies More at This Tier Than the Price Differences Suggest",
    "explanation": "The Universal Audio Volt 2 includes a unique combination of UA's own plugin suite plus a 3-month Splice sample subscription, a genuinely different software value proposition than the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2's more traditional Ableton Live Lite and plugin bundle, or the PreSonus ioStation's full Studio One Artist DAW inclusion. This matters directly based on what software you already own or plan to use, where owning a full DAW like Studio One already makes the ioStation's bundle redundant, while a Splice subscription might appeal specifically to musicians who use sample libraries in their production process. Compare the actual named software titles included in each bundle against what you currently use or need, rather than assuming all software bundles in this tier offer comparable value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Single Versus Dual Simultaneous Preamps Is a Hard Functional Requirement, Not a Nice-to-Have Upgrade",
    "explanation": "The Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 4th Gen and PreSonus ioStation 24c both offer 2 simultaneous mic preamps, letting you record two microphones at once for interviews or duo performances, while the Audient iD4 MKII and Universal Audio Volt 2 offer only 1, meaning they simply can't record two people simultaneously regardless of how good their individual preamp quality might be. This matters as a baseline functional requirement determined entirely by your recording format, not a quality tradeoff, since a single excellent preamp still can't record two voices at once. Determine your actual typical number of simultaneous recording sources first, since this single spec eliminates half the options in this tier before any other comparison point becomes relevant."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is the Universal Audio Volt 2's vintage preamp mode suitable for podcast recording, or is it only for music?", "a": "It can work for podcasts if you like a slightly warmer vocal tone, but most podcast production benefits more from a clean, transparent preamp that you can process afterward, so the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 or Audient iD4 are typically better starting points for spoken-word content." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a single-channel interface at this price tier?", "a": "Buying a single-preamp interface like the Audient iD4 for a format that will eventually need to record two people, then discovering they need a second interface or an external mixer, when a dual-channel option like the Scarlett 2i2 would have avoided that upgrade cost entirely." },
  { "q": "Is the PreSonus ioStation 24c worth the extra cost over the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 if I don't need a physical fader?", "a": "If you're confident you'll navigate your DAW entirely with a mouse and keyboard, the Scarlett 2i2 delivers similar core audio quality for about $25 less, but if hands-on physical mixing control appeals to your workflow, the ioStation's motorized fader is a genuinely useful addition worth the price difference." },
  { "q": "How do I set up the Audient iD4 MKII's dual-function monitor dial for computer volume control?", "a": "The dial automatically switches to computer volume control mode when connected via USB and no external monitor speakers are actively selected, and this function is typically enabled by default without requiring separate driver configuration." },
  { "q": "Can I use these interfaces with a laptop that only has USB-C ports?", "a": "All four picks in this comparison support USB-C connectivity either natively or via an included adapter cable, though checking each product's specific listed cable and port requirements is worth doing to confirm compatibility with your exact laptop model before purchase." },
  { "q": "Does the Universal Audio Volt 2's built-in 76 Compressor emulation replace the need for a compressor plugin in my DAW?", "a": "For basic vocal leveling during recording, it can reduce or eliminate the need for a separate compressor plugin, but many producers still add additional compression in post-production for more precise control over the final mix." }
