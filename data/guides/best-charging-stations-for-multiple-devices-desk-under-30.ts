export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    criterion: "Check whether a power adapter is actually included before comparing prices",
    explanation: "Some charging station listings explicitly state that a power adapter is not included, meaning the sticker price doesn't reflect your real total cost, since you'll need to supply your own USB wall adapter or powered hub to actually deliver power to the station. This detail is easy to miss when comparing prices at a glance, and a station priced a few dollars cheaper can end up costing the same or more than a competitor once you factor in buying a separate adapter you don't already own. Read the listing's included-items section specifically for \"power adapter not included\" language before assuming the sticker price is your final cost."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Confirm which wireless charging ecosystem a station is actually built for",
    explanation: "Wireless charging stations in this price range are typically built specifically around either Apple's wireless charging standards or Android/Samsung's, and these aren't universally interchangeable despite both using similar-looking charging pads, since the exact charging coil alignment and power delivery standards can differ enough to cause inconsistent or absent charging on the wrong ecosystem's devices. Buying an Apple-focused wireless station for a Samsung phone, or vice versa, risks the device not charging reliably or at all, even though the station physically looks similar. Check the specific listing for named device compatibility (iPhone/Apple Watch/AirPods versus Samsung/Android) rather than assuming any wireless charging station works with any phone."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Decide between wireless convenience and cable-based universal compatibility",
    explanation: "A wireless charging station eliminates cables for supported devices entirely, a genuine convenience, but only works with devices built for that specific wireless standard, meaning it can't charge a laptop, a non-wireless-charging phone, or any device outside its supported ecosystem. A cable-based organizer works with literally any device that has the right cable, from phones to tablets to handheld gaming devices, at the cost of needing to plug in and manage cables rather than simply setting a device down. If your household or desk has a genuine mix of device types and brands, a universal cable-based organizer is more practical than a wireless station locked to one ecosystem."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Look for dedicated holders if you're organizing more than just a phone",
    explanation: "A basic charging organizer often provides a flat, general tray or slot meant primarily for a phone, which can leave a smartwatch or earbuds case sliding around loosely rather than sitting securely in a designated spot. Some stations at this price specifically include shaped holders sized for a watch band or an earbuds case, keeping these smaller, easier-to-misplace items organized alongside the phone. If you regularly set down more than just a phone at your charging spot, a station with these dedicated holders is worth the small price premium over a generic flat tray."
  },
  {
    criterion: "Consider material and desk aesthetic alongside pure function",
    explanation: "Several charging stations in this price range use natural bamboo construction specifically, giving a warmer, more furniture-like appearance than plastic alternatives, which matters if the charging station will sit visibly on a shared desk or living space rather than being tucked out of sight. This is purely an aesthetic consideration that doesn't affect charging function, but it's a real factor worth weighing if you've specifically avoided plastic charging accessories before for how they look on a desk."

export const faq = [
  {
    q: "Will an Apple-focused wireless charging station work with my Samsung phone?",
    a: "Not reliably. Wireless charging stations built specifically for Apple's ecosystem may not properly align or deliver power to a Samsung or other Android device, even though the charging pad looks similar. Check the specific listing's named device compatibility before assuming any wireless station works universally."
  },
  {
    q: "Why do some charging stations not include a power adapter?",
    a: "Some manufacturers assume you already own a compatible USB wall adapter from another device and design the station as a cable/device organizer rather than including redundant hardware. Check the listing's included-items section specifically, since you'll need to budget for a separate adapter purchase if one isn't included."
  },
  {
    q: "Is a bamboo charging station better than a plastic one?",
    a: "Bamboo primarily offers a different aesthetic, a warmer, more natural look than plastic, without necessarily changing the actual charging function. Choose based on how the station will look in your space if visible aesthetics matter to you, since the underlying cable or wireless charging function works the same regardless of material."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I charge my laptop on one of these multi-device stations?",
    a: "Generally no, the stations in this price range are built for phones, tablets, watches, and earbuds rather than laptop charging, which typically requires higher wattage than these stations provide. Check the specific listing's stated wattage and supported device types if laptop charging is part of your need."
  },
  {
    q: "Do wireless charging stations charge devices as fast as a wired charger?",
    a: "It depends on the specific station's wattage output and your device's wireless charging capability, but wireless charging is often somewhat slower than a compatible wired fast charger. If charging speed is your top priority, check the station's stated wireless wattage output against your device's maximum supported wireless charging speed."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mix wireless and cable-based charging on the same desk?",
    a: "Yes, there's no conflict in using a wireless station for compatible devices alongside a separate cable-based organizer for devices that don't support wireless charging. Many desks combine both approaches based on which specific devices need which charging method."
