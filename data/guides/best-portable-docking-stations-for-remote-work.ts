Because it has no power brick of its own, it also clears airport security screening without needing a separate bin the way plug-in docks do.\n\nA genuine advantage here is that dual 4K output covers most remote desk setups.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the real power delivery wattage, not just \"PD\" in the listing",
    "explanation": "Power delivery (PD) wattage determines whether a dock can actually charge your laptop while it's connected, not just pass a trickle of power through, and this number varies widely, from 60W barely-adequate figures up to 100W or higher business-tier docks.\n\nThis matters because a dock rated below what your laptop actually needs to charge under load, especially a larger laptop or one running demanding tasks while docked, will slowly drain the battery even while \"charging\", a frustrating and easy-to-miss problem.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific PD wattage number, and compare it against your laptop's actual charging brick wattage, not just whether the listing mentions power delivery at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify actual display support against your specific laptop and GPU, not just port count",
    "explanation": "A dock listing multiple HDMI or DisplayPort outputs doesn't guarantee your laptop can actually drive all of them at full resolution and refresh rate simultaneously, that capability depends on your laptop's specific GPU and USB-C controller, which some docks work around using DisplayLink technology and others don't.\n\nThis distinction matters a lot if you're building a dual or triple monitor setup, since a laptop that can't natively drive multiple external displays will show a blank or mirrored screen on a non-DisplayLink dock's extra port, regardless of how many ports the dock has.\n\nCheck whether the dock uses native DisplayPort Alt Mode or DisplayLink chip technology, and separately verify your specific laptop model's documented maximum number of external displays before assuming any multi-port dock will drive them all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match data transfer speeds and Ethernet to what you actually move and how",
    "explanation": "USB data ports on a dock range widely in real transfer speed, from basic 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds up to 10Gbps or higher, a gap that matters enormously if you regularly move large files to and from external drives, but barely matters if you're just charging a mouse and keyboard.\n\nEthernet port speed follows the same logic, a dock's Gigabit or 2.5Gb Ethernet port is only as fast as your actual home or office network infrastructure supports, so paying for 2.5Gb Ethernet on a network that tops out at Gigabit gains nothing.\n\nCheck the specific listed speed for each port type you'll actually use regularly, and compare Ethernet speed against your router's actual rated speed, not just the dock's spec sheet in isolation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm compatibility with your specific laptop's USB-C or Thunderbolt port",
    "explanation": "Not every USB-C port supports the same features, some laptops only support USB-C data and charging without any video output over that port at all, while others support full Thunderbolt with much higher bandwidth for multiple 4K displays.\n\nDocks built around Thunderbolt certification generally support more demanding multi-display and high-speed configurations, but require a genuinely Thunderbolt-capable port on your laptop to unlock that performance, plugging a Thunderbolt dock into a USB-C-only port still works but loses the extra bandwidth.\n\nCheck your specific laptop's documented port capabilities (Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, or USB-C without Thunderbolt), not just that it has a USB-C-shaped port, before assuming any docking station will unlock its full advertised capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider heat and long-term reliability under sustained daily use",
    "explanation": "A docking station that stays plugged in and under load for 8+ hours a day handles thermal stress very differently than a hub used occasionally for a quick file transfer, and a compact plastic-bodied dock with no real heat dissipation can throttle performance or degrade faster under that kind of sustained daily use than an aluminum-bodied one.\n\nThis matters more for anyone using the dock as their primary daily workstation setup than for occasional or travel use.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of the dock running hot, disconnecting intermittently after extended use, or degrading over months, rather than relying on the unboxing-day performance most reviews describe."

    q: "What's the difference between a bus-powered and an AC-powered portable docking station?",
    a: "A bus-powered dock draws all of its power from the laptop's USB-C port, so it can run connected displays and peripherals but can't fully charge the laptop at the same time. An AC-powered dock, like the Anker Prime 14-Port in this list, has its own power brick and can charge the laptop while driving displays simultaneously, at the cost of extra weight and a brick to carry.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a portable docking station work with a hotel room TV?",
    a: "Usually for mirroring a desktop display, yes. But most hotel HDTVs run older HDMI versions with HDCP content protection, so streaming apps with protected content may still be blocked on that TV even though the dock itself connects and outputs video correctly. This is a limitation of the hotel TV, not the dock.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do portable docking stations cause problems at airport security?",
    a: "A compact dock with its own external power brick typically needs to go in a separate bin, the same as a laptop charger. A bus-powered hub with no brick of its own, like the UGREEN 7-in-1 or Anker Nano in this list, usually clears security screening without any extra steps.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a portable docking station at a cafe without a power outlet?",
    a: "Yes, a bus-powered dock like the UGREEN 14-in-1 Multiport needs no outlet of its own since it draws power from the laptop. Keep in mind that running a full docked setup off laptop battery alone drains the battery measurably faster per hour than working plugged in, so it's better suited to shorter sessions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my webcam look blurry through a portable docking station?",
    a: "The USB-A port on many portable docks runs USB 2.0, which comfortably supports a standard 1080p webcam but doesn't have the bandwidth for a full-resolution 4K webcam. If webcam quality matters for client calls, verify the specific port speed on the dock's listing or connect the 4K webcam directly to a USB 3.0 port on the laptop instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which portable docking station is best for a corporate-managed laptop?",
    a: "The HP USB-C Dock G5 is the strongest fit for a company-issued laptop, since business-brand docks are more likely to already be IT-approved and it's built with secure remote management scenarios in mind. If you rely on VPN software, check with your IT department before buying any third-party dock, since some corporate VPN clients can conflict with non-OEM networking hardware.",
