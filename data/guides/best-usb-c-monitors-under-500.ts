export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In KVM Switch Replaces a Separate Piece of Hardware Entirely",
    "explanation": "KVM stands for Keyboard, Video, and Mouse, and a monitor with a built-in KVM switch, like the BenQ pick in this comparison, lets you connect two separate computers to the monitor and switch which one your single keyboard and mouse control, typically with a button press or hotkey. Without this built-in feature, achieving the same result requires buying a separate standalone KVM switch device, an additional cost and another piece of hardware cluttering your desk, so a monitor with this feature built in is providing real, quantifiable added value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Delta E Tolerance Numbers Aren't All Equally Strict",
    "explanation": "A Delta E figure describes the average color deviation from a reference standard, and a lower number means tighter, more accurate calibration; a monitor stating Delta E under 2, common on lower-priced calibrated monitors in this budget-tier series, is actually a stricter accuracy claim than a monitor at this higher price stating Delta E under 3, like the BenQ pick here. Don't assume a pricier monitor automatically has tighter color accuracy tolerance than a cheaper one, since calibration precision and price don't always move together in the exact same direction."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multiple Calibration Standards Named Together Signal More Thorough Testing, Not Just More Marketing Text",
    "explanation": "Some listings, like the BenQ pick in this comparison, name several distinct certifications together, Pantone Validated, Pantone SkinTone Validated, and Calman Verified, each testing a genuinely different aspect of color accuracy, from general color matching to specifically accurate human skin tone reproduction. When a listing names multiple named, checkable standards rather than one vague generalized claim, that's a signal of a more thorough calibration process rather than just longer marketing copy."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Hub Monitor's Port Count Determines How Many Accessories It Can Actually Replace",
    "explanation": "A monitor marketed as a USB-C hub, like the Dell Pro Plus pick in this comparison, is only as useful as the specific number and type of additional ports it provides beyond the single upstream connection to your laptop. Before assuming a hub monitor eliminates the need for a separate dock, count exactly how many USB-C, USB-A, and Ethernet ports the specific model offers and compare that against how many accessories you actually need to connect daily."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Ultrawide's Lower Resolution Compared to 4K Doesn't Mean Lower Overall Value",
    "explanation": "The ASUS ultrawide pick in this comparison has a lower total resolution (3440x1440) than the standard 4K picks (3840x2160), but its panoramic aspect ratio provides more usable horizontal workspace for many multitasking scenarios, at a genuinely lower price than the 4K alternatives here. Comparing monitors purely by resolution number misses that screen shape and total usable workspace matter just as much as raw pixel count for many real workflows."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need special software installed to use the BenQ PD2706U's built-in KVM switch?", "a": "No, a hardware KVM switch built into the monitor operates independently of either connected computer's operating system, typically activated through a physical button or hotkey on the monitor itself, without requiring any software installation on either machine." },
  { "q": "Is Delta E under 3 on the BenQ pick actually noticeably less accurate than Delta E under 2 on cheaper monitors in this series?", "a": "For most general creative and office work, the difference between Delta E under 2 and under 3 is subtle and often not perceptible to the naked eye, though for extremely color-critical professional print or video work, the tighter Delta E under 2 tolerance is the more rigorous standard." },
  { "q": "Can the Dell Pro Plus hub monitor replace a separate USB-C docking station entirely?", "a": "It depends on how many devices you need to connect; the Dell Pro Plus provides HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C hub connectivity, which covers many common docking needs, but check the specific port count and types against your own accessory list before assuming it fully replaces a dedicated dock." },
  { "q": "Does the ASUS ultrawide's lower resolution make text look less sharp than the 4K picks in this guide?", "a": "At the same or similar screen size, a lower resolution panel like the ASUS ultrawide's 3440x1440 will show slightly less sharp text and fine detail than a 4K panel, though the difference is generally more noticeable in side-by-side comparison than in standalone daily use." },
  { "q": "How is Pantone SkinTone Validation different from standard Pantone Validation?", "a": "Standard Pantone Validation confirms a display accurately reproduces Pantone's general color reference library, while Pantone SkinTone Validation specifically tests accuracy for a range of human skin tones, relevant for photography, video, and portrait-focused creative work where accurate skin color reproduction matters most." },
  { "q": "Which monitor in this comparison is the best fit if I mainly want to replace a two-monitor setup?", "a": "The ASUS VA34VCPSR's 34 inch curved ultrawide format is specifically built for this, offering roughly the same horizontal workspace as two smaller monitors placed side by side, at the lowest price in this comparison." }
