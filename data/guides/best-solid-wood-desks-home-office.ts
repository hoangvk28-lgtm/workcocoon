    q: "What is the best solid wood desk for home office use?",
    a: "For a full 60 inch workstation, the Pemberly Row is the strongest solid wood option. For a compact setup under $200, the Winsome Studio 42 inch in solid beechwood is the most proven - brand has been making solid wood furniture since 1977. If storage matters, the IC International Vista or ODCVKRT add drawers without dropping to MDF construction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is rubberwood (parawood) the same as solid wood?",
    a: "Yes. Rubberwood, also sold as parawood, is a genuine hardwood - the wood of the Hevea brasiliensis tree, harvested after latex production ends. It has a Janka hardness of ~980 lbf, harder than many pine species. It is a legitimate hardwood used in quality furniture, not a marketing term for cheap materials.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I tell if a desk is really solid wood?",
    a: "Read the full product description, not just the title. Look for specific wood species names (parawood, beechwood, acacia, solid oak). If the listing says engineered wood, composite, or MDF anywhere in the materials section, the top is not solid wood. The word wood in the title alone means nothing - it applies equally to MDF desks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are solid wood desks worth the extra cost?",
    a: "For a home office desk used daily, yes. MDF desks typically show visible wear within 2 to 4 years: chipped edges, swollen surfaces near windows, peeling veneer at corners. Solid wood desks can be sanded and refinished. The higher upfront cost amortizes over a longer lifespan, and the surface stays repairable.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size solid wood desk do I need for a home office?",
    a: "42 to 48 inches for a single-monitor setup, 55 to 60 inches for dual monitors or ultrawide displays. Under 40 inches starts to feel cramped with a keyboard, mouse, and accessories in active use simultaneously.",
