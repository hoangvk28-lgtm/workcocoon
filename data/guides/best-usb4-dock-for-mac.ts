export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Apple's Display Output Limits Vary by Chip Generation, Not Just by the Dock You Choose",
    "explanation": "The Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Dock specifically discloses that dual 4K 60Hz display support works on M4/M5 and Pro/Max chip Macs, while base M1 and M2 MacBooks are limited to a single external display regardless of the dock's own capabilities, a hardware limitation set by Apple's own chip architecture rather than any fault in the dock. This matters significantly if you're using an older or base-tier Mac chip and expecting dual monitor support, and matters less if you already own a Pro, Max, or M4/M5-generation Mac. Check your specific Mac model and chip generation's own stated external display limits before assuming any dock, regardless of its own display specs, will unlock dual monitors on an incompatible chip."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Mac mini Storage Dock and a MacBook Display Dock Solve Fundamentally Different Problems",
    "explanation": "The Acer and Akkyajaure picks are specifically built as Mac mini stands with integrated SSD enclosures, addressing the Mac mini's lack of user-expandable internal storage, while the Plugable picks are built for MacBooks that already have their own internal storage and instead need external display and charging support. This matters based on which Mac you actually own, where a Mac mini owner needing more storage gets no benefit from a MacBook-focused display dock, and a MacBook owner needing dual monitors gets no benefit from a Mac mini storage stand. Confirm which specific Mac model you're outfitting before choosing between these two genuinely different dock categories."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UL Safety Certification for Power Delivery Is a Verifiable Third-Party Standard Worth Checking For",
    "explanation": "The Plugable 16-in-1 dock specifically states its 100W Power Delivery was third-party lab tested to UL standards, a recognized independent safety certification that verifies the charging circuitry meets established electrical safety benchmarks, unlike a dock that simply claims '100W charging' without disclosing any independent testing. This matters if charging safety and long-term reliability are a priority, particularly since a dock handles both your laptop's charging and multiple connected peripherals simultaneously, and matters less if you're comfortable relying on general product reviews rather than a specific certification. Look for a specifically stated UL or similar independent safety certification in a listing rather than assuming all docks claiming a wattage figure have been independently verified."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Mac mini Dock's Aluminum Stand Design Can Serve a Genuine Dual Thermal Purpose",
    "explanation": "The Acer pick's elevated aluminum stand specifically improves airflow around the Mac mini itself while simultaneously acting as a passive heat sink for the installed SSD, a dual-purpose thermal design that addresses two separate heat sources (the Mac mini and the SSD) with one physical structure. This matters if you're running the Mac mini under sustained heavy workloads where thermal throttling could reduce performance, and matters less for light, intermittent use where heat buildup is rarely a practical concern. Check whether a Mac mini stand or dock specifically discloses its thermal design approach if you plan to use the Mac mini for demanding, sustained workloads."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Editorial Recognition Like 'Dock of the Year' Is a Real Third-Party Signal, But Not a Substitute for Checking Your Own Specific Needs",
    "explanation": "The Plugable 16-in-1 dock's specifically stated Laptop Mag 2025 Dock of the Year recognition is a genuine third-party editorial endorsement that reflects broad testing and comparison against competitors, giving it more independent validation than a dock with no such recognition. This matters as one useful data point among several when comparing similarly specced docks, but shouldn't override checking the dock's specific port count, display support, and price against your own actual requirements. Treat editorial awards as a supporting signal rather than the sole factor, and still verify the dock's specific stated specs match your own Mac model's needs before purchasing based on an award alone."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Will the Plugable dock give my base M2 MacBook Air dual monitor support?", "a": "No, the listing specifically discloses that base M1 and M2 MacBooks are limited to a single external display regardless of the dock, since this is a limitation of the Mac's own chip architecture rather than the dock's capability." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a USB4 dock for their specific Mac?", "a": "Assuming any dock's advertised dual-display support will work on their exact Mac model without checking the dock's specific chip-generation compatibility notes, then discovering only a single display works after purchase due to their Mac's own chip limitations." },
  { "q": "Is the Plugable 16-in-1 dock worth the extra $90 over the smaller Plugable pick if I only need dual monitors?", "a": "If dual-display support and 100W charging are your only real needs, the smaller Plugable dock covers that at a lower price, but if you want the highest port count, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and UL-certified charging safety, the 16-in-1 pick's extra cost is justified." },
  { "q": "Can I install any M.2 SSD into the Acer or Akkyajaure Mac mini dock enclosures?", "a": "Both docks specifically state compatibility with standard M.2 NVMe PCIe and NGFF SATA SSD sizes (2230/2242/2260/2280), so checking your specific SSD's form factor against these supported sizes before purchase is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Do these docks require installing any drivers on macOS?", "a": "The Plugable picks specifically state driverless, plug-and-play operation on macOS, while the Mac mini storage docks similarly function without additional driver installation, though checking each specific listing's stated setup requirements is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Akkyajaure Mac mini dock's USB4 Host port with a MacBook instead of a Mac mini?", "a": "The dock is specifically designed and marketed for Mac mini models, so while the underlying USB4 connection could technically work with a MacBook, you would lose the dock's Mac mini-specific stand and cooling design benefits, making a MacBook-focused dock like the Plugable picks the better fit for that use case." }
