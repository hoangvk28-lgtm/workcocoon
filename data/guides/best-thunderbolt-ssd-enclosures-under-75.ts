export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An Intel-Certified Chip Like the JHL7440 Represents a Different Reliability Standard Than a Compatible Chip",
    "explanation": "Both ACASIS picks in this comparison specifically use the certified Intel JHL7440 chip, meaning Intel has formally tested and approved that specific chip implementation for Thunderbolt compliance, a distinction from the ASM2464PD chip used in the ICY BOX and UGREEN picks, which is designed to be compatible with Thunderbolt protocols without carrying the same formal Intel certification. This matters if certified compliance specifically matters for your professional or business use case, where formal certification can matter for procurement standards or long-term reliability assurance, though the ASM2464PD chip is also widely used and generally reliable for typical use. Check whether a listing specifically names an Intel-certified chip model versus a compatible third-party chip if formal certification is a specific requirement for your use case."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Specific Real-World Speed Benchmark With Named Test Hardware Is More Trustworthy Than a Theoretical Maximum Claim",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS with Fan pick states tested speeds of 2805/2734 MB/s specifically verified with a Samsung 980 Pro on a MacBook, and the ICY BOX pick states a specific 10GB transfer in under 7 seconds benchmark, both concrete, verifiable performance claims tied to named test conditions, unlike a listing that only states a theoretical maximum interface speed like '40Gbps' without confirming actual achieved transfer rates. This matters because the theoretical maximum speed of an interface rarely matches real-world sustained transfer speeds, which depend on the specific SSD, cable, and host device combination used. Look for a listing that specifies real-world tested speeds with named hardware, treating an unqualified theoretical maximum speed claim with appropriate skepticism about what you'll actually experience."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thunderbolt 5 Forward Compatibility Provides Genuine Future-Proofing Value as That Standard Becomes More Common",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS Aluminum Fins pick specifically states compatibility with Thunderbolt 5 in addition to Thunderbolt 4/3 and USB4, meaning the same enclosure will work with newer computers and devices as Thunderbolt 5 adoption increases, a genuine future-proofing consideration the Thunderbolt 4-focused picks in this comparison don't offer. This matters if you plan to use this enclosure for several years across multiple computer upgrades, where Thunderbolt 5 compatibility could become more relevant over that ownership period, and matters less if you plan to replace or upgrade your storage solution again relatively soon regardless. Consider your expected ownership timeline for this enclosure before weighting Thunderbolt 5 forward compatibility heavily in your decision."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Established Brand's Stated Company History Provides Some Signal About Long-Term Product Support Continuity",
    "explanation": "The ICY BOX pick specifically states a 26-year German engineering history in storage products, a longer track record than a newer, less established brand might have, suggesting a more mature company with presumably more experience in the specific engineering challenges of enclosure design and potentially more stable long-term customer support infrastructure. This matters somewhat for warranty and support reliability over the ownership period, though a newer brand can still offer competitive products and support, so brand history is one factor among several rather than a definitive quality indicator on its own. Consider a brand's stated history and track record as one input alongside actual product specifications and warranty terms, not as a standalone deciding factor."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Manual Fan Activation Requires an Extra Step Compared to Fully Automatic Temperature-Based Fan Control",
    "explanation": "The ACASIS with Fan pick specifically requires pressing a switch to activate the cooling fan, an extra manual step compared to a fully automatic temperature-triggered fan system, meaning you need to remember to engage cooling proactively before a heavy transfer rather than the enclosure automatically responding to rising temperatures. This matters if you tend to start large transfers and walk away, where you'd need to remember to activate the fan beforehand to get its cooling benefit during that unattended transfer. Check whether a listing describes fan activation as manual (a physical switch) or automatic (temperature-triggered) if hands-off operation during large transfers matters to your workflow."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does an Intel-certified chip like the JHL7440 make a noticeable real-world speed difference over the ASM2464PD chip?", "a": "The theoretical maximum speeds are similar between these chip types, so the practical difference comes down more to certification assurance and dual-chip stability claims rather than a dramatic real-world speed gap, with actual performance depending more on your specific SSD and cable combination." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing between active and fanless cooling at this tier?", "a": "Assuming fanless designs always sacrifice significant performance, when the ACASIS Aluminum Fins pick uses the same Intel-certified chip as its fan-equipped sibling and performs well for typical use, with active cooling mainly benefiting the most sustained, extended heavy transfer workloads specifically." },
  { "q": "Is the ACASIS with Fan pick worth it over the cheaper ACASIS Aluminum Fins option?", "a": "If you specifically run sustained, extended heavy workloads where active cooling prevents thermal throttling, yes, but if your use is more typical or intermittent, the fanless Aluminum Fins pick delivers the same Intel-certified chip and silent operation for about $4 less." },
  { "q": "How do I remember to activate the ACASIS fan manually before starting a large file transfer?", "a": "Building a habit of pressing the fan switch before any large or extended transfer is the practical approach, though if you frequently forget this step, a fully automatic temperature-triggered enclosure like the ACASIS Aluminum Fins pick's passive design (which needs no activation at all) avoids this concern entirely." },
  { "q": "Can I use these enclosures with a MacBook that only has USB-C ports without Thunderbolt support?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison work with standard USB-C ports, though achieving the full stated 40Gbps speed requires a genuine Thunderbolt 3/4 or USB4 port specifically, with a standard USB-C-only port delivering reduced speeds instead." },
  { "q": "Do any of these enclosures come with the NVMe SSD included, or do I need to purchase that separately?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison are enclosures only, requiring you to purchase and install a compatible M.2 NVMe SSD separately, so factor that additional cost into your total budget when planning this purchase." }
