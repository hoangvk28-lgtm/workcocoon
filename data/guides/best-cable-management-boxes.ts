    "explanation": "Listings for a 8 best cable management boxes (2026) often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."

  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the 8 best cable management boxes (2026) holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What is a cable management box used for?", a: "A cable management box hides a power strip and its associated cables inside an enclosed container, eliminating the visible wire tangle that accumulates behind desks, entertainment centers, and workstations. The box gives the appearance of a clean surface while keeping all cables functional and accessible when the lid is opened." },
  { q: "Are cable management boxes safe?", a: "Yes, when used within the power strip's rated capacity. The key safety considerations are adequate ventilation to dissipate heat (ventilation holes or mesh construction), not overloading the power strip beyond its rated amperage, and keeping the cables dry. Flame-retardant or fire-resistant boxes (Bluelounge CableBox, Chouky) add a layer of safety beyond standard ABS construction." },
  { q: "Can you put a power strip in a cable management box?", a: "Yes. That is the primary use case. A power strip fits inside the box with its cables routed through the rear slots or open sides. The power strip plug exits the box through the rear, and all device cables enter the box and plug into the strip inside. The box conceals the power strip, surge protector, and adapter cluster from view." },
  { q: "Do cable management boxes work under desks?", a: "Cable boxes designed for on-surface use (D-Line, Yecaye, Cantalop) can be placed on the floor under a desk. Under-desk cable trays (Cinati, Litwaro) are specifically designed to mount under the desk surface using a clamp. The under-desk tray option completely removes cables from the visible desk and floor plane for the cleanest appearance." },
  { q: "How do I organize cables inside a cable management box?", a: "Route all device cables into the box first, then plug them into the power strip inside. Bundle excess cable length with velcro ties (included in the Chouky and YUANYE kits). Keep the power strip's own power cable as short as possible and route it out through the dedicated rear slot. Avoid tight bends on cables near plugs, as repeated bending at connection points causes cable damage over time." },
