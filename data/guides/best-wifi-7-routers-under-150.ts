export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Router's \"BE\" Model Number Isn't a Direct Mbps Figure",
    "explanation": "WiFi 7 routers are often marketed with a combined number like BE3600 or BE6500 in their model name, which represents the sum of theoretical maximum speeds across all bands added together, not a real-world figure you'll actually see on a speed test. Two routers with similar model numbers can have meaningfully different actual per-band Mbps figures, so it's worth checking the specific stated 5GHz and 2.4GHz numbers in the listing rather than assuming the model number alone tells you which router is faster."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual-Band WiFi 7 Still Delivers Real Features, Just Without the 6GHz Band",
    "explanation": "Every router in this under $150 comparison is dual-band, meaning it operates on 2.4GHz and 5GHz but skips the newer 6GHz band that tri-band WiFi 7 routers include. You still get genuine WiFi 7 technology like Multi-Link Operation and 4K-QAM on the bands these routers do support, so dual-band WiFi 7 at this price is a real upgrade over WiFi 6, just without the extra headroom and reduced interference that a dedicated 6GHz band provides in very crowded wireless environments."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Router's Stated Coverage Area Assumes Ideal, Obstruction-Free Conditions",
    "explanation": "Square footage coverage claims, like \"up to 2,400 sq. ft.\", are measured under open, unobstructed test conditions that rarely match a real home's layout with walls, floors, and furniture in the way. In practice, expect real-world coverage to fall meaningfully short of the stated figure, particularly in homes with multiple floors, dense construction materials, or a router placed in a corner rather than a central location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "EasyMesh and Proprietary Mesh Systems Aren't Interchangeable",
    "explanation": "Some routers in this comparison, like the TP-Link picks, support the open EasyMesh standard, letting you expand coverage later with any EasyMesh-certified extender from any brand, but explicitly are not compatible with TP-Link's own separate Deco mesh product line. The ASUS pick instead uses ASUS's own AiMesh system, which only works with other AiMesh-compatible ASUS routers. Before planning a future mesh expansion, confirm which specific mesh standard your router supports and buy expansion hardware within that same ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual-WAN Support Solves a Real Reliability Problem for Buyers With Spotty Internet",
    "explanation": "A router with dual-WAN support, like the ASUS pick in this comparison, can automatically switch to a secondary connection, such as a 4G LTE or 5G mobile hotspot, if your primary wired internet connection drops. This is a genuinely useful feature specifically for buyers in areas with unreliable ISP service or during severe weather that knocks out cable or fiber lines, though it does require either a second internet plan or a compatible mobile data source to actually use."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is a dual-band WiFi 7 router actually worth it over a WiFi 6 router at a similar price?", "a": "Yes, dual-band WiFi 7 routers still deliver genuine improvements like Multi-Link Operation and 4K-QAM for better throughput and lower latency on the bands they support, even without the 6GHz band found on pricier tri-band WiFi 7 routers." },
  { "q": "Can I mix and match EasyMesh extenders from a different brand than my router?", "a": "Yes, that's the specific benefit of the open EasyMesh standard used by the TP-Link picks in this comparison, unlike a proprietary mesh system, EasyMesh-certified devices from different manufacturers can generally work together, though checking specific compatibility before buying is still wise." },
  { "q": "Does the ASUS RT-BE58U's dual-WAN feature require a second internet subscription?", "a": "For a true wired backup connection, yes, but its 4G LTE/5G mobile tethering option can use a phone's mobile hotspot or a dedicated cellular modem as the backup source instead of a second wired ISP subscription." },
  { "q": "Why does the TP-Link Archer BE400 have a higher coverage claim than the NETGEAR RS90 despite similar pricing?", "a": "The BE400's 6-stream dual-band radio configuration and higher combined bandwidth support a larger stated coverage area (2,400 sq. ft. versus 2,000 sq. ft.) and higher device count (90 versus 50), reflecting genuinely different internal hardware specifications between the two routers." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my internet plan actually needs a 2.5 Gbps WAN port?", "a": "Check your internet service provider's plan speed; if your plan is rated above 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps), a standard 1 Gig WAN port will bottleneck your connection, and you'll need a router with at least one 2.5 Gbps WAN port, like all four picks in this comparison, to use your full plan speed." },
  { "q": "Will setting up three separate SSIDs on the ASUS RT-BE58U slow down my main network?", "a": "Generally no for typical home use, since the router's processing handles multiple SSIDs without a meaningful performance penalty under normal household device counts, though very heavy simultaneous usage across all three networks could reveal some shared bandwidth limitations." }
