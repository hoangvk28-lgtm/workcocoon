    q: "What is the difference between a gaming headset and regular headphones for gaming?",
    a: "Gaming headsets include a built-in or boom microphone. Regular headphones do not. For gaming communication (multiplayer, streaming, voice chat), a gaming headset is the practical choice. For pure audio quality without the mic, studio headphones plus a separate USB microphone typically outperform any gaming headset at equivalent price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is wireless gaming latency actually noticeable?",
    a: "With 2.4GHz wireless, no. Latency is under 2ms, identical to wired for gaming purposes. With Bluetooth, yes. Bluetooth adds 40 to 250ms depending on codec. For competitive gaming (FPS, fighting games), always use 2.4GHz wireless or wired. Bluetooth is acceptable for casual play, strategy games, and RPGs.",

  {
    q: "What is virtual 7.1 surround sound actually worth?",
    a: "It depends on the game. In open-world and story-driven games, virtual 7.1 improves environmental immersion. In competitive FPS titles like Valorant or CS2, most pro players disable 7.1 and use clean stereo because the DSP processing degrades mid-range frequencies where weapon and footstep audio lives. All picks in this guide support both modes.",

    q: "Which gaming headset works best on PS5?",
    a: "The Sony INZONE H9 is certified for PS5 360 Spatial Sound and has the deepest PS5 system integration in this guide. The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro and HyperX Cloud II Wireless both work on PS5 via their 2.4GHz dongles. The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless does not support PS5.",
  },
  {
    q: "How important is headset weight for gaming?",
    a: "More important than most buyers expect. Under 250g is imperceptible after hours of wear. 250 to 350g is noticeable but comfortable. Over 350g causes neck fatigue during sessions over 3 to 4 hours. The Logitech G435 at 165g and Arctis Nova 3 at 145g are the lightest picks, both suitable for all-day use.",
