    question: "What is the best charging station for a home office?",
    answer: "For most home offices, the Anker Prime 200W handles a laptop alongside 3--5 accessories at full speed from one hub. MacBook Pro 16\" users should choose the UGREEN Nexode 200W for its 140W PD 3.1 primary port. Budget-conscious setups with AC outlet needs are best served by the TESSAN 130W 8-in-1.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a home office charging station charge a MacBook?",
    answer: "Yes -- all five picks in this guide charge MacBooks. MacBook Air and Pro 14\" need 35--70W for a meaningful charge under load; the Anker Prime (100W primary) handles both. MacBook Pro 16\" needs 100W+ under heavy load; only the UGREEN Nexode at 140W guarantees full-speed charging regardless of workload.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a docking station or a charging station for my home office?",
    answer: "If you use an external monitor and want one-cable desk connectivity, you need a docking station. If you just want to charge the laptop and accessories cleanly from one hub (laptop connects to monitor via its own HDMI/DisplayPort), a charging station is enough and significantly cheaper.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best charging station for a home office with multiple devices?",
    answer: "The Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 handles the most diverse home office device mix -- laptop via retractable cable, phone via Qi2 wireless, tablet + accessories via USB-C -- in the most cable-clean configuration. The TESSAN 130W 8-in-1 handles the most simultaneous devices (8) at the best price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a GaN charging station worth it for a home office?",
    answer: "Yes, consistently. GaN chargers run cooler, quieter (fanless), and more efficiently than silicon alternatives at the same wattage. For a home office where the charger runs 8+ hours daily, the thermal and noise benefits are practical -- not just marketing. All five picks in this guide use GaN technology.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I hide a charging station on a home office desk for video calls?",
    answer: "Place the hub at the back corner of your desk, behind the monitor stand. Use 30cm short cables from hub to devices. Route the power cord along the back desk edge with adhesive cable clips. For maximum cleanliness, mount the hub under the desk.",
