For mid-range Windows laptops with USB4 ports: USB4 dock is the right match and costs less. For standard USB-C laptops: a USB-C hub or dock is sufficient for single-monitor use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a docking station charge a laptop?",
    answer: "Yes, all docks in this guide charge laptops via the same Thunderbolt or USB-C cable that connects peripherals. Charging wattage varies: Anker 777 at 90W, CalDigit TS4 at 98W, CalDigit TS5 Plus at 140W dedicated. Always verify the dock's PD wattage is sufficient for your specific laptop model.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a docking station and a USB hub?",
    answer: "A docking station adds monitor output, Ethernet, and full peripheral connectivity via a single cable -- it replaces multiple cables with one. A USB hub expands USB ports and sometimes adds HDMI, but without Thunderbolt's full bandwidth or monitor-driving capabilities. For one-cable desk connectivity including monitors, a dock is required. For just more USB ports, a hub is enough.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one dock work for both my laptop and desktop?",
    answer: "This depends on your desktop's ports. Most desktops use USB-A and HDMI directly -- they don't need a dock. For a setup where you switch a dock between a laptop (for travel) and a desktop (at desk), a KVM-capable dock is the right tool.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a docking station improve desk cable management?",
    answer: "Dramatically. A fully connected desk without a dock typically has 5--8 cables to the laptop. With a dock: one cable. All other cables run to the dock, which sits to one side or under the desk.",
  },
  {
    question: "What docking station works with a MacBook Air?",
    answer: "MacBook Air M3 and M4 have Thunderbolt 4 ports. Any TB4 dock works. The Anker 777 is the best value for MacBook Air -- 90W charging is sufficient (Air has a lower power draw than Pro), and the port selection covers any standard desk.",
