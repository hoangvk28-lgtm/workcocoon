  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the ink tank printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this ink tank printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any ink tank printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."

  {
    q: "What's the maintenance box everyone skips mentioning?",
    a: "It's a waste ink pad or box inside the printer that collects overflow ink during cleaning cycles, separate from the refillable tanks themselves. It fills up after roughly 3 to 5 years of typical use and requires a $30-50 replacement or service, a real hidden cost that isn't part of the initial ink tank pitch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does ink tank ink ever dry out or clog?",
    a: "It's more resistant to drying than cartridge ink, but it isn't immune, if the printer sits completely idle for 4 or more weeks, ink can still settle and clog print head nozzles. Running an occasional test print or nozzle check prevents this if you know the printer will go unused for a while.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is ink tank print quality as good as a cartridge printer?",
    a: "For text and everyday graphics, yes, ink tank printers handle these very well, comparable to cartridge inkjets. For photos specifically, quality is good but generally falls short of a dedicated photo inkjet's cartridge-based pigment or dye ink systems for skin tones and fine gradients.",
  },
  {
    q: "How risky is refilling the ink tanks myself?",
    a: "The main risks are spilling ink while pouring and accidentally pouring the wrong color into the wrong tank, which can damage the printer. Use the bottle's own nozzle, pour slowly over a protected surface, and double-check the tank's color label before refilling to avoid both issues.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose Epson EcoTank or HP Smart Tank?",
    a: "Both are legitimate refillable ink tank ecosystems. This guide includes 7 Epson EcoTank models across a range of feature tiers and 1 HP Smart Tank model as the lowest-priced overall pick with 2 years of ink included. If you don't have a brand preference, compare the specific feature set and price tier that matches your home office's actual print volume and needs.",
