export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Tested IP Rating Means Something Specific, a General Claim Doesn't",
    "explanation": "An IP rating, like IP65, follows a standardized testing protocol for dust and water resistance, where each digit corresponds to a specific tested level of protection. When a listing states this rating along with a specific drop-height figure like 3 meters, it means the manufacturer put the product through an actual test to that standard. A listing that only says \"durable\" or \"rugged\" without citing a specific rating or figure hasn't necessarily failed any test, but it also hasn't proven anything you can verify, so weigh these claims differently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "This Tier Spans a Wide Real Speed Range Despite One Price Ceiling",
    "explanation": "Unlike some price tiers where speed differences are modest, drives under $150 in this comparison range from 450MB/s up to 2000MB/s, a more than 4x difference, all within the same budget ceiling. This makes checking the actual rated speed more important here than at some other tiers, since the price alone tells you very little about which speed bracket a given drive falls into. Match the speed to your actual use case: basic file transfer doesn't need 2000MB/s, but frequent large 4K video work benefits noticeably from it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length Signals Manufacturer Confidence",
    "explanation": "A longer stated warranty, like the 3-year limited warranty on the PNY pick in this comparison, often reflects the manufacturer's own confidence in the product's long-term reliability, since a company backing a product for longer takes on more potential replacement cost if failure rates are high. When comparing two similarly priced and specced drives, a meaningfully longer warranty is a reasonable tiebreaker, though the absence of a stated warranty length doesn't automatically mean a shorter one, just that it isn't prominently advertised."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Health Monitoring Features Aren't Universal Even Above $100",
    "explanation": "TRIM support and S.M.A.R.T. health diagnostics remain inconsistently documented across this price range, some listings specifically call them out, others don't mention them despite being priced similarly. If tracking your drive's long-term health matters to you, look specifically for a listing naming these features by name rather than assuming a higher price guarantees their inclusion."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity Choice Should Match Realistic File Sizes, Not Just Budget",
    "explanation": "At this tier, both 500GB and 1TB options are realistically available, and the right choice depends on what you're actually storing, not just which price feels more comfortable. A 500GB drive handles documents, photos, and moderate video comfortably, while heavier 4K video work or large game installs benefit meaningfully from the extra headroom a 1TB drive provides at a similar or only somewhat higher price."
  }

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What does an IP65 rating actually mean for a portable SSD?", "a": "IP65 means the device is fully protected against dust ingress and protected against water jets from any direction, based on a standardized testing protocol. It's a specific, verifiable claim rather than general marketing language like \"durable\" or \"rugged,\" which don't reference any particular tested standard." },
  { "q": "Is it worth paying nearly double for a drive with a tested IP rating?", "a": "It depends on how you'll actually use the drive. If it's genuinely exposed to dust, water, or rough job-site conditions, a tested IP65 rating like the PNY pick's is worth the extra cost. If it mostly stays in a bag or on a desk, a cheaper drive without that specific rating is likely sufficient." },
  { "q": "Why does one 500GB drive cost $93 and another cost $69 with similar specs?", "a": "The price difference usually comes down to documented features like health monitoring, rated speed, and brand reputation, rather than the underlying storage technology itself. The pricier SSK pick in this comparison documents S.M.A.R.T. and TRIM support and rates faster, while the cheaper Orlian pick doesn't specify those features." },
  { "q": "Does a 1TB drive at $150 make more sense than two 500GB drives?", "a": "For most buyers, yes, one 1TB drive is simpler to manage than juggling two separate 500GB drives, and the PNY 1TB pick in this comparison costs roughly the same as buying two of the pricier 500GB options here. The exception is if you specifically want physically separate backups on two different drives for redundancy." },
  { "q": "Do budget drives without a stated warranty still come with any protection?", "a": "Most electronics sold through Amazon carry at least a basic manufacturer warranty even when it isn't prominently advertised, but the length and terms vary. Check the specific listing's warranty information section rather than assuming a standard length, and favor a listing that states its warranty term explicitly if that matters to you." },
  { "q": "Can I use a drive rated for a specific USB generation on an older computer?", "a": "Generally yes, most external SSDs are backward compatible with older USB standards, but your transfer speed will be capped at whatever the older port supports, not the drive's full rated speed. Check that the drive explicitly states backward compatibility if you're connecting it to an older USB 2.0 or 3.0 port." }
