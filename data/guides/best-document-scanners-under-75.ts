Its Auto Scan Mode automatically detects what you're scanning, whether a document, a photo, or a mixed page, and adjusts settings without manual configuration.\n\nCompared to the handheld wand scanners in this comparison, it trades pocketable portability for a more reliable, hands-off scanning process, and it connects over standard USB rather than relying on batteries or a memory card for storage.\n\nBest for buyers who want a proper flatbed scan for documents and photos and don't need to carry the scanner anywhere.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Flatbed and Handheld Wand Scanners Solve Genuinely Different Problems",
    "explanation": "A flatbed scanner holds the page still under a lid while a sensor moves beneath it, producing a consistent, evenly lit scan every time regardless of who operates it. A handheld wand scanner requires the user to drag the device across the page at a steady, even pace, and an inconsistent hand speed can produce a warped or streaky scan. Check the product listing for words like \"flatbed\" versus \"handheld\" or \"wand\" before buying, since these terms describe fundamentally different mechanisms, not just different sizes of the same tool."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DPI Resolution Determines Whether Small Text Stays Readable After Scanning",
    "explanation": "DPI, or dots per inch, measures how much detail a scan captures, and a low setting like 300 DPI is fine for a quick reference copy of a receipt but can blur small text or fine print if you zoom in later. A higher setting like 900 DPI captures much more detail but also creates a larger file size, which matters if you're filling up a small memory card. Look for the specific DPI number and whether the scanner offers multiple selectable modes, rather than assuming a single quoted maximum DPI applies to every scan you take."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Wand Scanner's Power Source Affects How Ready It Is When You Need It",
    "explanation": "Every handheld wand scanner in this comparison runs on 2 AA batteries rather than a rechargeable built-in battery, which means you're responsible for keeping spares on hand or the scanner becomes unusable exactly when you need it. This is a tradeoff for simplicity, since AA batteries are cheap and universally available, but it's worth checking whether a listing includes batteries or expects you to supply your own before assuming it's ready to use out of the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Memory Card Capacity and Transfer Method Determine How Many Scans You Can Store Before Offloading Files",
    "explanation": "A wand scanner without a computer connection saves files directly to an SD card, and a 16GB card holds far fewer high-resolution 900 DPI scans than a 32GB card before you need to offload files to a computer. Check both the included card size and whether the scanner requires physically removing the card to transfer files or can connect via USB cable directly, since removing a tiny SD card repeatedly is a real point of friction some buyers overlook."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Software-Free Operation Removes a Real Setup Barrier for Casual Users",
    "explanation": "Several handheld scanners in this price range specifically advertise requiring no driver installation or companion software, working as a plug-and-play device that saves files a computer can read directly off the memory card. This matters most if you're scanning on a device where installing new software isn't convenient or allowed, such as a work laptop with restricted permissions, so check whether a listing explicitly states no software is required rather than assuming every scanner works this way."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do these handheld wand scanners work without being connected to a computer?", "a": "Yes, the Hczrc and AOZBZ picks save scans directly to an included micro SD card and require no computer connection during scanning, though you'll eventually need a card reader or the MUNBYN's USB cable to transfer files off the device." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake people make with a handheld wand scanner?", "a": "Dragging the wand too quickly or unevenly across the page, which produces a warped, streaky, or partially blank scan, since the sensor needs a steady, consistent pace to capture the full page correctly." },
  { "q": "Is the Canon Canoscan Lide 300 flatbed worth it over a cheaper handheld wand scanner?", "a": "If you'll mostly scan at a desk and want consistent results without practicing a hand technique, yes, the flatbed's evenly lit, hands-off scan is worth the roughly $15 premium over the wand scanners in this comparison." },
  { "q": "How do I choose the right resolution setting on a multi-mode handheld scanner?", "a": "Use a lower setting like 300 DPI for quick reference copies of receipts or simple documents, and switch to 600 or 900 DPI when scanning anything with small text or fine detail you'll need to read clearly later." },
  { "q": "Can a handheld wand scanner damage an old or fragile photo the way a feed-fed scanner might?", "a": "No, since a wand scanner is dragged by hand across the surface rather than pulled through internal rollers, it avoids the folding or jamming risk that a sheet-fed scanner can pose to a fragile print." },
  { "q": "Do I need to buy anything extra to start using the Hczrc or AOZBZ scanners out of the box?", "a": "Both require 2 AA batteries that are not included, so factor that into your purchase, though both do include a micro SD card for storage so you won't need to buy one separately." }
