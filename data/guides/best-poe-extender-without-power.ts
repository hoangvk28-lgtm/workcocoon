export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A True Passthrough Design Draws 100% of Its Power From the Upstream PoE Source, Not Just Most of It",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically confirm they require no local AC power supply, drawing their entire operating power directly through the incoming PoE cable from an upstream switch or injector, a genuinely different design from an extender that needs its own wall adapter for at least some of its operation. This matters significantly if you're installing in a location with no nearby electrical outlet, like inside a wall cavity, above a drop ceiling, or in an outdoor junction box, since a local-power-dependent extender simply wouldn't work in that location at all. Check a listing specifically for language confirming zero local power requirement, rather than assuming any 'PoE extender' label means fully passthrough operation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Passthrough Extender's Total Output Wattage Is Limited by Its Upstream Input, Not an Independent Power Source",
    "explanation": "The PoE Passthrough Switch pick specifically states its 90W input splits into one 60W port and three 30W ports, meaning the total power available across all four outputs is capped by whatever the upstream PoE switch can actually deliver, unlike a locally-powered device that has its own independent power budget. This matters if you're connecting multiple higher-wattage devices simultaneously, since the combined draw could exceed what your upstream PoE source can supply even if each individual port's rating seems adequate on paper. Check your upstream PoE switch's total power budget against the combined wattage of all devices you plan to connect through a passthrough extender, not just each port's individual maximum rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VLAN Isolation on Output Ports Prevents Connected Devices From Seeing Each Other's Network Traffic",
    "explanation": "The YuanLey and 100Mbps PoE Passthrough Switch picks both specifically include VLAN isolation on their output ports, meaning devices connected to different ports can't see or interfere with each other's network traffic even though they share the same physical extender, a real security benefit in a shared or multi-tenant installation. This matters if you're connecting devices belonging to different security zones or different users through the same extender, and matters less if all connected devices already trust each other on the same private network. Check whether a passthrough extender specifically names VLAN isolation as a feature if network segmentation matters for your particular installation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Industrial-Grade Metal Enclosure With a Wide Temperature Range Matters More for Genuinely Harsh Deployment Environments",
    "explanation": "The LINOVISION pick's specifically stated IP53 metal enclosure and -22F to 149F operating range, combined with 4kV surge protection, target genuinely harsh industrial or outdoor environments more robustly than a standard plastic-enclosure extender rated for typical indoor or moderate outdoor use. This matters if your installation faces real temperature extremes, dust, or electrical surge risk, and matters less for a climate-controlled indoor network closet where a standard enclosure performs adequately. Check a passthrough extender's specific enclosure material, temperature range, and any stated surge protection rating if your deployment environment is genuinely demanding, rather than assuming any 'industrial' label means the same protection level."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "24V Passive PoE Devices May Not Work With a Standard IEEE 802.3af/at/bt Passthrough Extender",
    "explanation": "Two of the picks in this comparison explicitly state they do not support 24V passive PoE, meaning a device using that less common power standard, rather than the more prevalent IEEE 802.3af, 802.3at, or 802.3bt standards, simply won't receive power through these particular passthrough extenders. This matters significantly if you're not certain which PoE standard your existing device uses, since connecting an unsupported 24V passive device could result in it not powering on at all despite the extender otherwise functioning correctly for other devices. Verify your specific device's exact PoE standard against a passthrough extender's explicitly stated compatibility before purchasing, rather than assuming all PoE-labeled devices work interchangeably."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do passthrough PoE extenders really need zero local power at all?", "a": "Yes, all four picks in this comparison specifically confirm they draw their entire operating power from the upstream PoE cable, requiring no local AC power adapter or outlet at the extender's own installation location." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a passthrough PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming any port on a passthrough extender can power any device, when several extenders specifically exclude 24V passive PoE devices and only support the more common IEEE 802.3af/at/bt standards." },
  { "q": "Is the LINOVISION passthrough switch worth the higher price over the basic YuanLey extender?", "a": "If you're installing in a genuinely harsh industrial or outdoor environment and need surge protection and a wide temperature range, the LINOVISION's higher price is justified, but for a standard indoor installation, the YuanLey pick's lower price and similar core functionality make it the better value." },
  { "q": "Can I power a higher-wattage device like a PTZ camera through a passthrough extender with no local power?", "a": "Yes, but only through a pick with a dedicated higher-wattage port like the 100Mbps PoE Passthrough Switch's 60W output, since a standard 30W-only passthrough extender may not adequately power a higher-draw device." },
  { "q": "Will a passthrough extender work if my upstream switch doesn't provide enough total PoE power?", "a": "No, since a passthrough extender has no independent power source, its total available output wattage is limited by whatever your upstream PoE switch or injector can actually supply, so checking your switch's total power budget against your connected devices' combined draw is important." },
  { "q": "Do I need VLAN isolation for a simple home network with just a couple of security cameras?", "a": "VLAN isolation matters more in shared or multi-tenant installations where different devices need to be kept from seeing each other's traffic; for a simple home network with trusted devices, it's a nice-to-have feature rather than a strict requirement." }
