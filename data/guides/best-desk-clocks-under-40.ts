export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Sensor Support Only Provides Value if You Actually Buy Additional Sensors",
    "explanation": "Both weather station picks in this comparison support up to 3 outdoor sensors but include only one in the box, meaning the multi-location monitoring capability requires purchasing additional sensors separately to actually use. Before choosing a weather station specifically for its multi-sensor expandability, factor in the additional cost of extra sensors if you plan to monitor more than one outdoor location, since the base unit alone only monitors a single outdoor spot."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A 7-Day Forecast Calibration Period Means Accuracy Improves Gradually, Not Instantly",
    "explanation": "Weather stations like the DreamSky and Newentor picks use barometric pressure trends specific to your location, calibrated over roughly 7-10 days, to generate their 12-24 hour weather forecasts, meaning the forecast accuracy genuinely improves the longer the unit has been running in one location rather than being immediately precise upon setup. Don't judge a weather station's forecast accuracy in its first few days of use, since the calibration period is a real, necessary part of how this feature works."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Color Display Isn't Just Cosmetic, It Genuinely Speeds Up Reading Multiple Metrics",
    "explanation": "The Newentor pick's color-coded LCD display, showing different metrics like temperature and humidity in visually distinct colors, lets you parse the screen faster than a monochrome display where every piece of information looks visually similar and requires more careful reading to distinguish. If you'll be checking the display quickly during a busy morning routine, this color-coding genuinely reduces the time needed to extract the specific information you're looking for."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery-Only Operation on Weather Stations Sacrifices Continuous Display for Portability",
    "explanation": "Both weather station picks specifically note that battery-only power (without the AC adapter plugged in) limits the display to brief 10-15 second glances before dimming to conserve power, a meaningful limitation if you were hoping for a continuously visible always-on display without being tethered to an outlet. If constant visibility matters more than portability, plan to keep these weather stations plugged into AC power rather than relying on battery-only operation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Indoor-Only Monitoring Genuinely Suffices for Buyers Who Already Check Outdoor Weather on Their Phone",
    "explanation": "The Geevon pick's indoor-only temperature and humidity monitoring, without outdoor sensor capability, is a reasonable choice specifically for buyers who already rely on their smartphone for outdoor weather information and just want indoor climate monitoring alongside accurate atomic timekeeping. Paying extra for outdoor sensor capability only makes sense if you'll genuinely use it regularly rather than defaulting to your phone anyway out of habit."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can I add more than 3 outdoor sensors to the DreamSky or Newentor weather stations if I have a larger property?", "a": "Based on the listings, both weather stations are specifically designed to support a maximum of 3 outdoor sensors; if you need to monitor more than 3 separate outdoor locations, you would need a different weather station model designed for greater sensor capacity." },
  { "q": "How accurate is the 12-24 hour weather forecast feature compared to a smartphone weather app?", "a": "These weather stations use local barometric pressure trends specific to your exact location for their short-term forecast, which can sometimes be more locally accurate than a broader regional forecast from a smartphone app, though both have inherent limitations in short-term weather prediction accuracy." },
  { "q": "Do I need to replace the outdoor sensor's battery separately from the main display unit?", "a": "Yes, the outdoor sensor and the main indoor display unit typically use separate batteries and need to be checked and replaced independently, since they're physically separate devices communicating wirelessly." },
  { "q": "Is the Geevon atomic clock's indoor temperature and humidity reading as accurate as a dedicated weather station's indoor sensor?", "a": "For general indoor comfort monitoring, yes, the Geevon pick's internal sensor provides comparable accuracy to the indoor readings on the DreamSky or Newentor weather stations, since indoor temperature and humidity sensing doesn't require the same wireless transmission technology as outdoor monitoring." },
  { "q": "Will the Maxspace wooden clock work well in a room where I also want temperature monitoring?", "a": "No, this pick is purely a timekeeping clock without any temperature or humidity sensing capability; if climate monitoring is important to you, choose one of the other three picks in this comparison instead." },
  { "q": "Can the weather stations in this comparison connect to a smartphone app for remote monitoring?", "a": "Based on the listings, neither the DreamSky nor Newentor weather stations mention smartphone app connectivity; they function as standalone display units without smart home or app integration, unlike some higher-end connected weather stations available separately." }
