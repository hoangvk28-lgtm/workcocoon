export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "At This Tier, 1TB and 500GB Can Cost the Same",
    "explanation": "Unlike lower price tiers where capacity scales predictably with price, right around the $100 mark it's possible to find a genuine 1TB drive at the same price as some 500GB options, as this comparison shows. This makes capacity-per-dollar the single most important number to check here rather than assuming a higher price always buys more storage. Compare the exact price of every drive you're considering against its actual capacity before assuming any one option is the better deal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Specific Durability Figure Beats General Language",
    "explanation": "Some listings state an exact drop-protection height, like 2 meters, or a specific IP rating for dust and water resistance, while others just describe a drive as \"durable\" or \"shockproof\" without a number attached. A stated figure gives you something concrete to compare across products and to judge against your actual use case, like tossing a drive in a bag versus using it in genuinely rough conditions. Treat vague durability language as less informative than a listing willing to cite a specific tested number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Health Monitoring Documentation Varies Even at the Same Price",
    "explanation": "TRIM support (which helps maintain consistent write speeds over time) and S.M.A.R.T. monitoring (which reports drive health) aren't universal even among similarly priced drives. Some listings in this price range explicitly document both, others don't mention either. If long-term reliability tracking matters to you, prioritize a listing that specifically names these features rather than assuming every SSD in this price range includes them by default."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Brand Track Record Is a Real Factor at Similar Price and Specs",
    "explanation": "When two drives offer genuinely similar specs at a similar price, an established storage brand's longer public track record can be a legitimate tiebreaker, particularly for buyers who've had reliability issues with less familiar brands before. This doesn't mean unfamiliar brands are automatically worse, several perform well, but it's a reasonable factor to weigh when specs alone don't clearly favor one option."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB Generation Still Sets the Real Speed Ceiling",
    "explanation": "Even at this higher price tier, the actual USB standard (3.1, 3.2 Gen 1, or 3.2 Gen 2) determines the realistic speed ceiling regardless of how the drive is marketed. A rated 1050MB/s figure only holds if your computer's own port and the cable used both support that same standard. Check the specific USB generation named in the listing, not just the top speed number, before assuming you'll see the full advertised performance."
  }

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Is it worth buying a 1TB drive over a 500GB one if they're the same price?", "a": "Generally yes, more capacity for the same price is a straightforward win unless you have a specific reason to prefer the 500GB option, like a documented feature such as S.M.A.R.T. monitoring that the 1TB alternative doesn't mention, or a stronger preference for an established brand name." },
  { "q": "Why does my 500GB drive show closer to 465GB in Windows?", "a": "This is expected and explained directly by some manufacturers: it's a result of decimal versus binary gigabyte calculation, not a defect or missing storage. A 500GB drive typically reports around 465GB in Windows while macOS may show closer to the full 500GB depending on how it calculates capacity." },
  { "q": "Does a faster rated speed matter if I'm mostly transferring documents and photos?", "a": "Not much in practice. The speed difference between a 600MB/s and 1050MB/s drive is most noticeable with large files like 4K video or big batches of RAW photos. For documents, spreadsheets, and typical photos, either speed tier feels close to instant, so prioritize capacity or price over chasing the highest MB/s number for this use case." },
  { "q": "Should I trust a newer, less familiar SSD brand at this price?", "a": "It depends on your risk tolerance. Newer brands can offer genuinely competitive specs and pricing, as seen with the capacity advantage of the nusyn pick in this comparison, but an established brand carries a longer public track record if you've been burned by unfamiliar electronics brands before." },
  { "q": "Do I need to buy a separate cable or adapter for these drives?", "a": "Check each listing specifically, some include both a USB-C cable and a USB-A adapter or cable in the box, while others include only a single USB-C cable. If you regularly use an older USB-A device, confirm the box contents before assuming an adapter is included." },
  { "q": "How much of a difference does drop protection actually make for a desk-bound drive?", "a": "If the drive mostly stays on a desk and rarely travels, stated drop protection matters less than if you're carrying it in a bag daily. It's still a reasonable feature to prefer when available at a similar price, since accidental desk-edge drops happen even in a stationary setup." }
