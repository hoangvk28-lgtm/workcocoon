  "Under $400, 90W USB-C power delivery becomes standard rather than an occasional upgrade, meaning even demanding creator laptops charge fully through the same cable carrying 4K video, and buyers gain a genuine choice between a wide 34 inch ultrawide and a taller 4K panel.",
  "We compared this lineup on USB-C wattage, DCI-P3 color coverage for creative work, and the real tradeoff between ultrawide screen shape and standard 4K resolution, since at this price both options are genuinely capable and the right choice depends on your specific workflow."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An Ultrawide Monitor Genuinely Replaces Two Standard Monitors for Many Workflows",
    "explanation": "A 34 inch ultrawide panel like the ASUS pick in this comparison offers roughly the same total horizontal pixel width as two 24 inch monitors placed side by side, without the visible bezel gap between two separate screens interrupting your workspace. This matters concretely for tasks like video editing timelines, side-by-side document comparison, or spreadsheet work with many columns, where the continuous screen space is genuinely more usable than the same total resolution split across two monitors."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "90W+ USB-C Power Delivery Matters Specifically for Creator and Gaming Laptops",
    "explanation": "Standard ultrabooks typically charge fully at 45-65W, but laptops built for video editing, 3D rendering, or gaming often ship with 90W or higher chargers, and connecting them to a monitor with lower USB-C wattage means the laptop may charge slowly or not keep pace with battery drain during heavy use. If your laptop's own charger is rated 90W or higher, prioritize a monitor stating the same or higher USB-C Power Delivery wattage, like the LG, ASUS, or ViewSonic picks in this comparison, rather than assuming any USB-C connection will fully power it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DCI-P3 and sRGB Measure Different Color Ranges, Not the Same Thing at Different Percentages",
    "explanation": "sRGB is the standard color space for most web and everyday digital content, while DCI-P3 is a wider color space originally developed for digital cinema that includes more vivid reds and greens than sRGB can display. A monitor stating 90% DCI-P3 coverage, like the LG pick in this comparison, is describing a different, broader color range than a monitor stating 100% sRGB coverage, so the two percentages aren't directly comparable to each other even though they sound similar."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Built-In Ethernet Port on a Monitor Can Replace a Separate Docking Station Entirely",
    "explanation": "Some monitors at this price, like the ASUS ultrawide pick, include a built-in RJ45 Ethernet port alongside USB-C docking, meaning your laptop gets a stable wired internet connection through the same single cable used for video and charging, without needing a separate USB-C dock or Ethernet adapter. This is a genuine cost and desk-clutter savings for anyone who prefers or requires wired internet over WiFi for video calls or large file transfers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-Device Switching Software Solves a Real Hybrid-Work Problem, Not Just a Nice-to-Have",
    "explanation": "If you regularly switch between a personal laptop and a work laptop, or a laptop and a desktop, connected to the same monitor, manufacturer software like LG's Switch feature lets you toggle the active input along with your keyboard and mouse control with one command, rather than manually unplugging and replugging USB peripherals or using your operating system's separate KVM software. This is worth checking for specifically if hybrid or multi-device work is part of your daily routine, since not every monitor at this price includes it."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does an ultrawide monitor require a more powerful graphics card than a standard 4K monitor?", "a": "Generally, driving an ultrawide's 3440x1440 resolution requires less graphics processing power than driving a full 4K panel's higher pixel count, so most laptops that can handle 4K comfortably will also handle an ultrawide's resolution without issue." },
  { "q": "Can I use the LG 27U730A's Switch feature with any two devices, or only LG products?", "a": "LG's Switch feature is built into the monitor itself and works with any devices connected via its available inputs, like two different laptops connected through USB-C and HDMI, not limited to LG-branded devices specifically." },
  { "q": "Is the difference between 90W and 65W USB-C power delivery actually noticeable in daily use?", "a": "For most ultrabooks, both wattages fully charge the laptop, but for demanding creator or gaming laptops drawing significant power during heavy use, a 65W connection may charge more slowly or fail to keep pace with battery drain, while 90W typically handles this better." },
  { "q": "Does the ASUS ultrawide's curved screen distort straight lines or affect design work?", "a": "A 1500R curvature is a relatively gentle curve designed mainly to keep the wide screen's edges within comfortable peripheral vision, and most users don't perceive noticeable distortion in everyday design or office work, though extremely precision-critical technical drawing may benefit from a flat panel instead." },
  { "q": "How does Pantone Validated certification differ from a monitor just claiming '100% sRGB'?", "a": "A 100% sRGB claim describes color gamut coverage within a specific standard, while Pantone Validated certification specifically confirms the display accurately reproduces colors from Pantone's own proprietary reference library, which is particularly relevant for branding and print design work that relies on exact Pantone color matching." },
  { "q": "Can I connect two separate laptops to the ViewSonic VP2766-4K at the same time?", "a": "Yes, it includes a USB-C upstream connection alongside an HDMI 2.1 input, meaning you can connect a primary laptop over USB-C and a secondary device over HDMI, and switch between them using the monitor's input selection." }
