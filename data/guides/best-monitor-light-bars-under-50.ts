export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What features should I look for in a monitor light bar under $50?",
    a: "The three most important features are auto-dimming, CRI rating, and control method. Auto-dimming handles brightness adjustments automatically when room light changes. CRI of 95 or higher ensures accurate color rendering on your desk and documents. Remote control (wireless) is more convenient than touch-only if you move around frequently. All three are available under $50 in this roundup.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Quntis the best monitor light bar under $50?",
    a: "The standard Quntis Computer Monitor Lamp at $39.95 is the most validated option in this category with 13,623 reviews at 4.6 stars, which is a stronger signal of consistent quality than any competitor in this price range. The Quntis with Remote at $31.99 adds wireless control for less money. The Quntis with Backlight at $49.99 adds bias lighting for the highest price in this roundup.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do budget monitor light bars reduce eye strain?",
    a: "Yes, if they are designed to direct light onto the desk rather than toward the screen. All bars in this roundup use an asymmetric lens that projects light downward and forward, not toward the monitor. The main cause of eye strain these bars address is the contrast between a bright screen and a dimly lit desk. Any option in this roundup will reduce that contrast compared to using no desk lighting.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between touch control and remote control on a light bar?",
    a: "Touch control requires reaching up to the bar on top of the monitor to adjust settings. Remote control uses a wireless transmitter you can place anywhere on the desk and press without moving. Remote control is more convenient if your monitor is far from arm's reach or if you adjust brightness frequently. The Quntis with Remote at $31.99 and the Quntis with Backlight at $49.99 both include remotes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can these budget light bars be used with curved monitors?",
    a: "Several options in this roundup are compatible with curved monitors. The Quntis with Backlight and Quntis with Remote both state curved monitor compatibility. The LYMAX models also support curved panels. The standard Quntis Computer Monitor Lamp and YEELIGHT work on gently curved monitors (1500R and above) but are not specifically designed for tight curves like 1000R. Check the product listing for the specific curvature radius your monitor uses.",
