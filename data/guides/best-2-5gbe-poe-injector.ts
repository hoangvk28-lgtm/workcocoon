export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A '2.5GbE' Label Should Be Confirmed as True 2.5Gbps Throughput, Not Just a Gigabit Port With Marketing Language",
    "explanation": "Every listing in this comparison explicitly states support for 2.5Gbps or 802.3bz compliance, but in a broader market search, some injectors labeled with 2.5G branding actually cap at standard Gigabit speeds internally despite the marketing name, meaning the actual throughput doesn't match the headline claim. This matters significantly if you're specifically buying to eliminate a Gigabit bottleneck for a higher-throughput access point, since a mislabeled unit would fail to deliver the improvement you're paying for. Check the listing's technical specification section for an explicit 2.5Gbps or 802.3bz standard mention, not just a product title or marketing bullet using '2.5G' language."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Specific Surge and ESD Protection Numbers Matter More at the 2.5GbE Tier Given the Higher Cost of Connected Equipment",
    "explanation": "A 2.5GbE-capable access point or camera typically costs meaningfully more than a basic Gigabit device, making the electrical protection quality of the injector powering it a more consequential decision, and a listing with a specific stated surge rating (like 4kV) and ESD rating (like 8kV) gives you a concrete comparison point rather than trusting a vague overvoltage protection claim. This matters more for a permanent installation in a less electrically stable environment, and matters less in a clean, modern indoor electrical setup with a stable power supply. Compare the specific stated kV numbers between listings when the cost of the connected 2.5GbE equipment justifies the extra scrutiny."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "First-Party Brand Sourcing Provides Real Value Specifically When You're Already Standardized on That Ecosystem",
    "explanation": "A first-party Ubiquiti 2.5GbE injector integrates cleanly if your network is already built around UniFi hardware, both for consistent branding in a rack and for confidence in the company's own PoE negotiation validation, while a generic third-party unit works identically from a pure electrical standpoint but doesn't carry that ecosystem consistency. This matters more for a business network where equipment standardization simplifies inventory and support, and matters less for a home network where any compliant 2.5GbE injector performs the same core function. Consider first-party sourcing specifically when ecosystem consistency has real organizational value for you."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Existing Cat5e Cabling Is Sufficient for 2.5GbE Speed, So You Likely Don't Need a Cabling Upgrade Alongside the Injector",
    "explanation": "The 2.5GbE standard (802.3bz) was specifically designed to run over existing Cat5e cabling at distances up to 100 meters, meaning most buildings already wired with Cat5e or better don't need a costly cable replacement just to gain the speed benefit from a 2.5GbE injector. This matters significantly for a retrofit installation where re-cabling would be expensive and disruptive, and matters less for new construction where you're already planning your cable specification from scratch. Confirm your existing cable is at minimum Cat5e rated before assuming you need new cabling to use a 2.5GbE injector's full speed capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "NDAA Compliance at the 2.5GbE Tier Follows the Same Institutional Logic as Every Other PoE Power Tier",
    "explanation": "Just as with standard Gigabit or higher-wattage injectors, NDAA and TAA compliance at the 2.5GbE tier restricts sourcing for U.S. government and government-adjacent procurement, adding a modest price premium for functionally identical 2.5GbE performance from a compliant manufacturer. This matters if you're purchasing for a government contractor, school district, or municipal network with a specific procurement policy requiring it, and matters not at all for a home or private business network with no such requirement. Check your organization's specific procurement policy before paying extra for compliance you may not actually need."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a 2.5GbE PoE injector for a standard Wi-Fi 6 access point?", "a": "Most standard Wi-Fi 6 access points work fine on Gigabit speed, but Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 models under heavy multi-client load can genuinely exceed 1Gbps, making a 2.5GbE injector worth the upgrade for those newer models specifically." },
  { "q": "Will a 2.5GbE PoE injector work over my existing Cat5e cable?", "a": "Yes, the 2.5GbE standard was specifically designed to run over existing Cat5e or better cabling up to 100 meters, so a cable upgrade typically isn't necessary." },
  { "q": "Is a first-party Ubiquiti 2.5GbE adapter necessary for a UniFi access point?", "a": "No, any compliant third-party 2.5GbE 802.3at injector should work with UniFi hardware, but a first-party adapter offers ecosystem consistency and direct brand validation if that matters to your setup." },
  { "q": "What's the real benefit of documented surge protection kV ratings over a generic overvoltage claim?", "a": "A specific stated number lets you objectively compare protection levels between listings, while a generic claim gives no way to verify how much protection is actually provided." },
  { "q": "Can I use a budget 2.5GbE injector for a business network installation?", "a": "You can, but for a business setting where compliance or extended warranty coverage matters to a purchasing decision, a certified option with NDAA compliance or a longer stated warranty is often worth the extra cost." },
  { "q": "Does 2.5GbE speed require a special network switch too?", "a": "Yes, to get the full speed benefit end-to-end, both your switch and the connected access point or device need to support 2.5GbE; otherwise the connection negotiates down to the lowest common speed." }
