export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Wireless Daisy Chain Cascading Has a Stated Maximum Distance That Limits Room Layout Flexibility",
    "explanation": "The Wireless Daisy Chain pick's cascading feature links two units wirelessly, but only up to 23 feet apart before the connection becomes unreliable, meaning the two placement points in your room need to fall within that range for the cascading feature to work as intended. This matters if you're considering this feature for a genuinely large or oddly shaped room, where the two units might need to sit farther apart than the stated range supports. Measure the actual distance between your two intended placement points against the stated maximum cascading range before assuming wireless cascading solves your specific room's coverage gap."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Included Satellite or Extension Microphone Serves a Genuinely Different Purpose Than Daisy Chaining a Second Full Unit",
    "explanation": "A satellite mic, like the one bundled with the EMEET Luna Plus Kit, or an extension microphone, like the one included with the RayBit pick, adds pickup range from a single additional microphone rather than a full second speaker and mic unit, making it a lighter-weight solution for extending pickup range without doubling your total hardware cost. This matters if your room's main challenge is pickup distance rather than needing a second independent speaker for volume in a far corner, where a satellite mic solves the actual problem more efficiently than daisy chaining two full units. Assess whether your room's issue is genuinely about mic pickup distance or about needing audible sound output in a second area before choosing between these two different expansion approaches."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Complete Bundled Kit With Included Accessories Changes the Real Cost Comparison Between Similarly Priced Units",
    "explanation": "The RayBit pick's complete POD4 kit bundles the extension microphone, wireless dongle, daisy chain cable, and USB-C cable all in the box, while a comparable single-unit purchase like the Yealink CP900 might require buying some of these accessories separately if you later want expansion capability. This matters when comparing the sticker prices of two units in this tier, since a lower listed price that requires additional accessory purchases later may end up costing more in total than a bundled kit at a similar or even higher upfront price. Check the listing's full contents list for what's actually included in the box before comparing prices purely at face value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Established Brand Presence Across Multiple Price Tiers Signals a Broader Support and Compatibility Ecosystem",
    "explanation": "The Yealink CP900 pick shares its brand with other Yealink units represented in this series' lower price tiers, meaning a company outfitting multiple rooms at different budget levels could standardize on Yealink hardware across the board, potentially simplifying IT support and firmware update processes compared to mixing several different brands. This matters more for organizations planning multiple purchases over time than for a single one-off purchase, where brand ecosystem consistency provides less practical benefit. Consider whether you're likely to purchase additional units from the same category in the future before weighting brand ecosystem consistency heavily in your decision."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated Total Attendee Capacity After Expansion Should Be Checked Against Whether It Assumes the Full Add-On Kit Is Purchased",
    "explanation": "The EMEET Luna Plus Kit + Luna bundle's stated capacity of up to 25 attendees assumes both the satellite mic and the second daisy-chained unit are actually deployed together, not just the base Luna Plus Kit's single-unit capacity of up to 14 people. This matters because comparing attendee capacity figures across different picks requires knowing whether that figure reflects the base unit alone or a fully expanded configuration, since quoting the wrong baseline could lead you to overestimate what a single purchase actually covers. Read the listing carefully to determine whether a stated attendee capacity assumes all bundled or optional accessories are in active use, not just what ships in the box by default."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the Wireless Daisy Chain pick's two units be used completely independently in two separate small rooms instead of cascaded together?", "a": "Yes, the listing specifically notes the units can be used alone as two standalone speakers in two separate small rooms, in addition to their cascaded large-room mode." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an extension mic versus a daisy chain setup at this tier?", "a": "Assuming daisy chaining a second full unit is always the better solution for a large room, when an extension or satellite mic, like the ones included with the RayBit and EMEET Luna Plus picks, can solve a pure pickup-range problem more efficiently and at lower added cost." },
  { "q": "Is the Wireless Daisy Chain pick worth it over the cheaper RayBit option?", "a": "If you specifically need wireless cascading without running a cable between two placement points, yes, but if you need extra-large single-room coverage via an extension mic instead, the RayBit pick covers that for about $42 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the EMEET Luna Plus bundle's wired daisy chain cable is included or needs to be purchased separately?", "a": "Check the specific listing's included contents carefully, since EMEET's daisy chain cables have historically been sold as a separate accessory in some of their kit listings, so confirming before purchase avoids an unexpected additional cost." },
  { "q": "Does the Yealink CP900's included BT50 dongle work with any Bluetooth device, or only Yealink phones?", "a": "The BT50 adapter is designed for broad Bluetooth device pairing rather than being restricted to Yealink-branded phones specifically, though checking the listing's compatibility notes against your specific device is worth doing before assuming universal pairing." },
  { "q": "Can these top-tier speakerphones be used for a small 2-3 person call without wasting their large-room capabilities?", "a": "Yes, all four picks function fine for smaller calls too, since their noise reduction and audio processing still apply regardless of room size, though you're paying for large-room capacity and expansion features you won't be using for consistently small calls." }
