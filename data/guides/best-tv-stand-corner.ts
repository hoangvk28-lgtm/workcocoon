  "A \"corner TV stand\" search actually covers two different products: a floor console shaped with a 90-degree back to sit flush in a room corner, and a wall-mounted bracket with an extension arm long enough to pull the TV out past the corner's apex. Buying the wrong type for your room means either a console that never fits flat against both walls or a wall mount that leaves the screen crammed into the angle instead of centered on your seating area.",
  "This guide ranks both categories together so you can match the product to your actual corner, whether that means freeing up floor space with a bracket and a long arm or anchoring media storage underneath the TV with a shaped console.",

A 180-degree swivel and plus or minus 8-degree tilt let you center the screen on a seating area that is not directly across from the corner, which is the normal situation in an angled room layout.\n\nThe bracket holds up to 132 lbs and ships with an HDMI cable for the initial hookup. Because it mounts to the wall rather than the floor, it frees up the entire floor area below the TV for other furniture, which a floor console cannot do in a small room.\n\nWorth calling out specifically: 180-degree swivel covers off-center seating. The catch is requires solid wall or stud, not hollow drywall alone.",

    description: "The Rfiver floor stand claims to save roughly 40 percent of the floor footprint that a comparable straight TV stand would need, thanks to a wood base shaped to sit against a corner rather than a flat wall. A 70-degree swivel lets you angle the screen toward a couch that is not centered on the corner, and three adjustable height levels give some flexibility for seated eye line.\n\nThe stand requires no wall drilling at all, since the TV mount and base are self-supporting, which makes it a fit for renters who cannot drill into walls. Weight capacity tops out at 88 lbs, which covers most 32 to 65 inch TVs but rules out larger or heavier panels.\n\nSaves significant floor footprint vs a straight stand. Set against that, 88 lb capacity limits TV size and weight. Both matter when comparing it to the other picks here.",

Weight capacity is 88 lbs, in line with the Rfiver pick, so it is best suited to TVs on the lighter end of its stated size range rather than the heaviest 70-inch panels available.\n\nA genuine advantage here is that tempered glass base adds visible stability.

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand corner often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand corner holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand corner over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand corner you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand corner that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "What's the difference between a corner TV stand and a corner TV wall mount?", a: "A corner TV stand is a piece of floor furniture with a shaped or angled back that sits against two walls meeting at a corner. A corner TV wall mount is a bracket with an extension arm that holds the TV directly on the wall in the corner, with no floor furniture involved. They solve different problems: the floor console adds storage, while the wall mount frees up floor space entirely." },
  { q: "How long of an arm do I need for a corner TV wall mount?", a: "Plan on at least 24 inches of extension as a practical minimum for a standard 90-degree corner, with 30 to 40 inches, like the BONTEC's 40.9 inch arm in this guide, giving you enough reach to pull the screen fully clear of the corner angle and center it on your actual seating area." },
  { q: "Can I mount a corner TV bracket on drywall alone?", a: "No. Corner mounts put more leverage on the wall anchor than a flat-wall mount because the arm extends the TV's weight further from the wall. The bracket needs to be anchored into a wall stud or solid masonry behind the drywall, not into drywall alone, regardless of the mount's stated weight rating." },
  { q: "Will a corner TV stand fit any corner in my room?", a: "Only if the corner is a standard 90-degree angle and you have enough clear wall space along both walls for the stand's full width. Measure both wall runs from the corner point before ordering, and check the console's projection depth into the room, since a corner-shaped back does not mean a small overall footprint." },
  { q: "Do corner floor TV stands need to be bolted to the wall?", a: "Most of the corner floor stands in this guide, including the Rfiver and YOMT picks, are freestanding and do not require wall drilling, which makes them a fit for renters. Some larger or taller consoles may include an optional anti-tip strap for safety around children or pets, which is worth using even though it is not a structural requirement like a wall-mount bracket." },
