    q: "Do I actually need a 4K webcam for video calls?",
    a: "Probably not. Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet all cap video quality at 1080p by default regardless of the camera, so a 4K webcam mainly benefits local recording or streaming to a platform that supports higher resolution. If meetings are your only use case, a 1080p pick like the Logitech C920S will look identical on the call.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does sensor size matter more than resolution?",
    a: "A larger sensor captures more light per pixel, which improves low-light performance and produces a more natural depth of field than a smaller sensor at the same resolution. Two 4K webcams can look noticeably different in real-world video because of sensor size differences that resolution alone doesn't reveal.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my 4K webcam look blurry or downscale during a stream?",
    a: "This is usually a bandwidth issue, either your internet upload speed can't sustain 4K, or the webcam is sharing a USB hub with another bandwidth-heavy device like an external SSD or capture card. Plug the webcam directly into a dedicated USB 3.0 port and check your actual upload speed before troubleshooting further.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do background removal and auto-framing features run on the webcam or my computer?",
    a: "They run on your computer's processor, not on the webcam itself. This means the quality and smoothness of AI features like background blur or auto-framing depends on your computer's processing power, not which webcam you buy, even a premium 4K webcam won't fix a weak laptop CPU.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it worth buying a 1080p webcam instead of a 4K one?",
    a: "Yes, if your main use case is standard video calls. Since most meeting platforms cap at 1080p anyway, a webcam like the Logitech C920S delivers the same practical call quality as a 4K webcam for a fraction of the price. Save the 4K upgrade for when you're actually recording or streaming in higher resolution.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a privacy shutter matter on a webcam?",
    a: "Yes, it's a simple physical feature that's easy to overlook while comparing resolution and sensor specs, but it gives a genuine, hardware-level guarantee that the camera isn't capturing video, unlike a software toggle. Several picks in this list, including the MX Brio and EMEET C960, include one built in.",
