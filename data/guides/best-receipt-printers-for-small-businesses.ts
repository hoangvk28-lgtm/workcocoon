      "This Rongta 80mm printer covers the standard receipt width most POS software expects by default, which matters because formatting a receipt for a mismatched paper width causes cut-off totals and wasted paper. An automatic cutter trims each receipt cleanly without a manual tear bar, a small detail that speeds up a busy checkout line.\n\nIt connects over USB for a simple counter setup and handles the daily volume of a retail shop or small restaurant without issue. The tradeoff is a slightly larger footprint than the mini printer in this list, so measure your counter space before buying if the surface is tight.\n\nWorth calling out specifically: auto cutter speeds up checkout.

This is the lowest-priced pick in this list and the best fit for genuinely low-volume or occasional use.\n\nCompact footprint fits tight counters or mobile stands.

    "explanation": "Listings for a receipt printer often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the receipt printer holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this receipt printer over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any receipt printer you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A receipt printer that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

    q: "What's the difference between a receipt printer and a shipping label printer?",

A shipping label printer prints in a 4x6 format matching Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, and USPS label sizing, and is built for packing and shipping orders rather than in-person checkout.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose 58mm or 80mm receipt paper?",
    a: "80mm is the standard most POS software defaults to and fits more content per receipt. 58mm suits a compact mobile stand or market stall, but check that your POS platform supports a 58mm receipt template first, since a mismatch can cause cut-off text.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do thermal receipts fade over time?",
    a: "Yes, thermal receipts commonly fade within 1 to 2 years, which matters for tax records or warranty documentation. Photocopy or scan any receipt you need to keep long term rather than relying on the thermal original staying legible.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will any receipt printer work with my POS software?",
