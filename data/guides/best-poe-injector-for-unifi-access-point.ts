export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "UniFi's Wi-Fi 7 Lineup Spans a Wide Power Range, So One Injector Doesn't Fit Every U7 Model",
    "explanation": "Unlike a simpler product category where one wattage tier covers most devices, Ubiquiti's Wi-Fi 7 access point lineup ranges from standard 2.5G models to the significantly higher-draw E7 Campus and U7 Pro XG, meaning an injector correctly matched to a standard U7 model may not deliver enough power for the higher-end models. This matters because underpowering a high-draw access point can cause it to fail to boot fully-featured radios or throttle performance rather than failing cleanly. Check your exact UniFi model's power class on Ubiquiti's own specification page before assuming any 2.5G-rated injector covers your specific device."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Link Speed Bottlenecks Are a Real Concern With Modern UniFi Access Points in a Way They Weren't With Older Wi-Fi 6 Models",
    "explanation": "Many Wi-Fi 6 UniFi models like the U6-Lite operate fine on a standard Gigabit injector since their real aggregate throughput rarely exceeds 1Gbps, but newer Wi-Fi 7 access points can push past Gigabit under heavy multi-client load, meaning a Gigabit-only injector becomes a genuine bottleneck rather than just an unused capability. This matters significantly if you're deploying a Wi-Fi 7 access point specifically to take advantage of its higher real-world throughput, and matters less if your actual network usage rarely approaches Gigabit speeds regardless of the access point's theoretical ceiling. Match your injector's port speed to your access point's actual expected throughput, not just its PoE power class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "First-Party Ubiquiti Accessories Reduce Support Complexity if You Ever Need to Troubleshoot a Power Issue",
    "explanation": "If a UniFi access point experiences an unexplained connectivity or performance issue, ruling out the power source is a common early troubleshooting step, and a first-party Ubiquiti injector removes one potential variable from that process since it's validated by the same company that builds the access point's PoE negotiation logic. This matters more if you're managing a business network where downtime has a real cost, and matters less for a low-stakes home setup where troubleshooting time is less critical. Consider a first-party accessory specifically for a mission-critical deployment where minimizing troubleshooting variables has real value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Active Device-Detection Chip Provides Real Protection When Deploying Injectors Across a Network With Mixed Equipment",
    "explanation": "A PoE injector with an active detecting chip, like the PROCET pick specifically states, identifies and classifies a connected device before applying power, meaning it won't send PoE voltage to a non-PoE device that could otherwise be damaged by an unexpected power injection. This matters more in a larger network deployment where injectors might occasionally get connected to the wrong port during setup or reconfiguration, and matters less for a single, permanently wired access point that's never moved once installed. Consider this feature specifically if you're managing multiple injectors across a growing or frequently reconfigured network."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Higher-Speed or Higher-Wattage Injector Than Your Specific UniFi Model Needs Isn't Free Insurance, It's Wasted Cost",
    "explanation": "Buying the PROCET 60W 10Gbps injector for a standard U6-Lite access point that only needs 30W at Gigabit speed doesn't provide any performance benefit, since the access point itself simply won't draw or transmit beyond its own actual capability, meaning the extra cost buys nothing but unused headroom. This matters for keeping a multi-access-point deployment cost-efficient, where matching each injector correctly to each access point model avoids overspending across the whole network. Check your specific UniFi model's actual power and speed rating rather than defaulting to the highest-spec injector as a safety margin."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does every UniFi access point need a special injector?", "a": "No, only if you're not using a PoE switch; and even then, matching the injector's power class and link speed to your specific UniFi model matters more than needing a UniFi-exclusive product for every model." },
  { "q": "Can I use a standard 30W 802.3at injector with any UniFi Wi-Fi 7 access point?", "a": "Not necessarily; some Wi-Fi 7 models like the E7 Campus and U7 Pro XG need the full 60W 802.3bt tier, so check your specific model's power class before assuming a standard 30W injector is sufficient." },
  { "q": "Is a first-party Ubiquiti injector necessary, or will any 802.3at injector work?", "a": "Most standard UniFi access points work fine with any compliant third-party injector, but a first-party Ubiquiti accessory removes any small compatibility uncertainty and is validated directly by Ubiquiti." },
  { "q": "What happens if I use an underpowered injector with a high-draw UniFi access point?", "a": "The access point may fail to fully boot, disable certain radio features, or perform unreliably, rather than simply not powering on at all, making underpowering a subtle issue to diagnose." },
  { "q": "Do older UniFi U6 access points need 2.5G or 10G injectors?", "a": "No, most U6-series access points operate fine on standard Gigabit speed since their real throughput rarely exceeds 1Gbps, making a 2.5G or 10G injector unnecessary extra cost for that generation." },
  { "q": "How do I find my specific UniFi access point's exact power requirement?", "a": "Check the model's official specification page on Ubiquiti's own website, which lists the exact PoE standard (802.3af, at, or bt) and maximum wattage draw for that specific access point." }
