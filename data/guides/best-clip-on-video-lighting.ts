export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check CRI rating, since it matters more than brightness for how you actually look on camera",
    "explanation": "CRI (Color Rendering Index) measures how accurately a light source renders true colors and skin tones compared to natural daylight, on a scale up to 100, and a high CRI (95 or above) genuinely matters more for looking natural on a video call than raw brightness or a wide color temperature adjustment range, since a low-CRI light can wash out or distort skin tone even at high brightness.\n\nThis matters directly if how you look on video calls is the actual reason you're buying a light, many budget listings bury or simply omit the CRI number entirely, which is itself a signal worth noting.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a stated CRI number, not just brightness or wattage figures, and treat the absence of a CRI spec as a gap worth weighing against picks that do disclose it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify clip mechanism thickness range against your specific monitor or laptop screen",
    "explanation": "A clip-on light's mounting mechanism has a maximum and minimum screen thickness it can grip securely, and this range varies between products, some fit a slim modern monitor bezel while others are sized for a thicker laptop lid or an older, bulkier monitor edge.\n\nThis matters directly because a clip too narrow for your screen won't close securely, and one mismatched for a thin edge risks slipping or not gripping firmly enough to hold the light's position through a call.\n\nMeasure your specific screen or laptop lid thickness and compare it against the exact clip range stated in the product specs before ordering, rather than assuming any clip-on light works universally."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider color temperature adjustability for matching your room's existing lighting",
    "explanation": "A fixed color temperature light can clash visibly with your room's existing ambient lighting, warm incandescent bulbs versus cooler daylight-toned overhead lighting, creating an unnatural, mismatched look on camera, while an adjustable-temperature light lets you dial in a tone that blends with your actual room.\n\nThis matters more if your workspace has mixed or warm-toned ambient lighting you can't easily change, less if you're in a neutral or daylight-lit space already.\n\nCheck whether the color temperature is adjustable and across what range (measured in Kelvin), and consider your room's existing lighting tone before assuming any light will look natural in your specific setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh battery power against a wired connection for your actual desk setup",
    "explanation": "A battery-powered light avoids running an extra cable across your desk and can be repositioned freely, but it requires remembering to charge it and eventually degrades in battery capacity over time, while a USB-powered wired light stays reliably powered for as long as it's plugged in but adds one more cable to manage.\n\nThis matters more if you already have limited USB ports or cable routing on your desk, or conversely if portability and cable-free positioning matter more to you.\n\nCheck the listing for power source and, if battery-powered, the stated runtime on a full charge, comparing that against how long your typical video call sessions actually run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check adjustable brightness range for varying room lighting conditions throughout the day",
    "explanation": "A room's ambient light changes meaningfully between a bright afternoon and a dim evening, and a light with only one or two brightness settings can be uncomfortably harsh in a dark room or barely noticeable in a bright one, while a wider, steplessly adjustable brightness range lets you match the light to the actual conditions at the moment of your call.\n\nThis matters more if you take calls at varying times of day with different natural light levels, less if your workspace has consistent lighting year-round.\n\nCheck the listing for the specific brightness adjustment range and whether it's stepped or continuously dimmable, not just the maximum brightness figure alone."

A high CRI (95+) matters more for looking natural on a video call than raw brightness or color temperature range, though many listings don't disclose this spec." },
  { q: "Will a clip-on light fit any monitor or laptop?", a: "Not automatically. Every clip mount has a maximum screen thickness it can grip securely, verify your monitor or laptop's edge thickness against the specific clip range listed for the light you're considering." },
  { q: "Is a rechargeable clip-on light better than a USB-powered one?", a: "It depends on your setup.
