export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Multi-Port Extender's Total Input Wattage Doesn't Split Evenly Into Equal Per-Port Output",
    "explanation": "The YuLinca pick specifically states a 30W max input splitting into 24W max output per port with an 8W average, illustrating that a 4-port extender's total power budget is shared and typically lower per port than the input figure alone suggests. This matters if you're connecting multiple devices that each draw close to the per-port maximum, since the combined draw needs to stay within the extender's actual shared power budget rather than assuming each port independently supports its full rated maximum simultaneously. Check a 4-port extender's specific per-port output wattage, not just its total input figure, before assuming every port can be maxed out at once."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PoE++ Support at 90W Per Port Serves a Genuinely Different Use Case Than Standard 24-30W PoE Extenders",
    "explanation": "The 90W PoE++ pick specifically supports IEEE 802.3af/at/bt standards, a substantially higher power tier designed for devices like heated PTZ cameras, digital signage, or advanced access points that standard 24-30W extenders simply cannot power adequately. This matters significantly if any device in your outdoor installation specifically requires PoE++ power, and matters much less if all your devices are standard IP cameras or access points that draw well under 30W. Check your specific devices' power requirements against an extender's maximum supported PoE standard before paying a premium for PoE++ support your devices don't actually need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Exact IP Rating Number Provides More Verifiable Water Protection Than General 'Waterproof' Language",
    "explanation": "The YuanLey and VLAN Function picks both specifically state an IP66 rating, a concrete, checkable certification, while the YuLinca pick uses general 'industrial-grade waterproof' language without citing a specific IP number, making its actual water resistance level less precisely verifiable. This matters if your installation faces genuine heavy rain or water exposure risk, and matters less for a covered or minimally exposed location. Look for a specific IP rating number rather than general waterproof marketing language if precise water resistance verification matters for your installation location."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VLAN Isolation Prevents One Malfunctioning Camera From Disrupting an Entire Multi-Camera Installation",
    "explanation": "The YuanLey and VLAN Function picks both specifically include VLAN isolation, which the VLAN Function listing states helps stabilize the whole network by isolating broadcast storms, a real protection against one misbehaving device flooding the shared network segment and degrading performance for every other connected camera. This matters significantly in a multi-camera CCTV installation where several devices share the same extender, and matters less for a single-device connection where broadcast isolation provides no practical benefit. Check whether a multi-port extender specifically includes VLAN isolation if you're deploying multiple cameras or devices through the same unit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Extended-Distance Mode on One Port Doesn't Necessarily Apply to All Ports Simultaneously",
    "explanation": "The YuanLey pick specifically states that a single output port can reach 250m in extend mode, implying the extended-range capability applies per-port rather than uniformly boosting all three output ports to that distance simultaneously. This matters if you need to reach one specific far-away device while keeping the other connected devices at standard range and speed, a realistic scenario for a perimeter installation with one distant camera and several nearby ones. Check whether an extender's extended-distance mode applies to a single port, multiple ports, or the whole unit before planning a mixed-distance installation."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a 90W PoE++ extender for a standard outdoor security camera?", "a": "Most standard IP cameras draw well under 30W, so a budget pick like the YuLinca or VLAN Function extender covers typical needs; PoE++ at 90W is specifically necessary only for higher-power devices like heated PTZ cameras." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 4-port outdoor PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming the extender's total input wattage is available independently to each of the four ports, when the actual per-port output is typically a smaller shared portion of that total input figure." },
  { "q": "Is the YuanLey extender's 250m extend mode useful if all my cameras are at a similar, shorter distance?", "a": "If all your cameras sit within the standard 100m range, the extended mode provides no benefit and you'd be better served by a simpler standard-distance extender like the YuLinca or VLAN Function picks at a similar price." },
  { "q": "Can I mix a high-power device and standard cameras on the same 4-port outdoor extender?", "a": "Only if the extender's per-port wattage covers your highest-power device; the 90W PoE++ pick specifically supports this mixed scenario, while the standard 24-30W picks may not adequately power a high-wattage device alongside standard cameras." },
  { "q": "How do I know if an outdoor PoE extender's waterproofing is good enough for my installation?", "a": "Check for a specific IP rating number like IP66 or IP67 rather than general 'waterproof' marketing language, and match that rating against your installation's actual exposure to rain, dust, or standing water." },
  { "q": "Does VLAN isolation slow down my cameras or add setup complexity?", "a": "No, VLAN isolation on the picks in this comparison is a built-in, automatic feature requiring no configuration, and it specifically improves network stability by preventing broadcast traffic from one device affecting others, rather than adding complexity." }
