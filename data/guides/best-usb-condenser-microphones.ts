    q: "What's the difference between 16-bit and 24-bit recording for a USB mic?",
    a: "24-bit recording captures more dynamic range, giving you more headroom to adjust levels after recording without introducing extra noise. 16-bit is adequate for straightforward voice use like meetings or casual streaming. Most desk use won't notice a practical difference unless you're doing heavier post-production editing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my condenser microphone sound bad even though it's not broken?",
    a: "The most common cause is gain staging, the input level set too high causes clipping, too low forces you to boost the signal later and amplifies background noise along with your voice. Set gain near the midpoint and monitor through headphones rather than guessing by ear alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do all the microphones in this guide have condenser capsules?",
    a: "No, and this list is upfront about that. Several picks, the FIFINE AmpliGame AM8, AM8T, and K688, are dynamic microphones included specifically because a condenser is the wrong choice for an untreated room. They're flagged clearly in each product's description rather than presented as condensers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Mac vs Windows affect which USB condenser microphone I should buy?",
    a: "It can. Some condenser mics require a driver install on one platform but run plug and play on the other, a detail that varies by model and isn't always listed clearly. If you regularly switch between a Mac and a Windows machine, a dynamic USB mic tends to behave more consistently across both.",
