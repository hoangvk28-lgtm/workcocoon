  "\"Glass TV stand\" covers two genuinely different products, and mixing them up is the most common mistake buyers make. A swivel tabletop base is a small tempered-glass platform that sits on top of an existing dresser, credenza, or media unit and lets the TV rotate for viewing angle adjustments. A full glass-shelf console is a standalone piece of furniture with its own legs, shelves, and storage, meant to be the only piece of furniture under the TV.",
  "Both styles use tempered glass for the base or shelving, and both show up when shoppers search for a glass TV stand, so this guide covers the best of each type and flags which is which for every pick.",

    "criterion": "Match actual size and capacity to your real need, not the category label alone",
    "explanation": "Listings for a tv stand glas often use a size or capacity label (\"compact,\" \"large,\" \"heavy-duty\") that isn't standardized across brands, so the same label can mean meaningfully different actual dimensions or capacity from one product to the next.\n\nThis matters because buying based on the category label rather than the specific listed dimensions or capacity is a common way to end up with something that doesn't actually fit your space or handle your real load.\n\nCheck the listing for exact measurements or a stated capacity figure, and compare that directly against your actual space or need, not just the marketing size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the tv stand glas holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm any headline feature actually works as advertised, not just that it's listed",
    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this tv stand glas over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",
    "explanation": "A high star rating built on a small number of reviews carries meaningfully less confidence than a slightly lower rating built on a large, established review base, since a small sample can be skewed by a handful of early, enthusiastic buyers before any longer-term issues would show up in later reviews.\n\nThis matters more for a purchase you're relying on to perform consistently over time, less for a low-stakes, easily replaceable item.\n\nCheck both the star rating and the review count together for any tv stand glas you're considering, and treat a high rating on a very small review count as a promising but less-proven signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check compatibility and fit with your existing setup before ordering",
    "explanation": "A tv stand glas that looks like a straightforward fit in photos can still have a compatibility detail, a connector type, a mounting requirement, a size threshold, that doesn't match your existing setup, and this kind of mismatch is one of the most common and avoidable reasons for a return.\n\nThis matters directly if the product needs to physically connect to, mount on, or otherwise integrate with something you already own.\n\nCheck the listing's specific compatibility details against your exact existing setup, not just the general product category, before ordering."

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Is a glass TV stand the same as a swivel TV stand?", a: "Not always. Some tabletop swivel bases, like the two PERLESMITH picks in this guide, use a tempered glass platform and are commonly marketed as glass TV stands. But full media consoles with glass shelving, like the WLIVE or YITAHOME picks, are also called glass TV stands even though they don't swivel. Check whether a listing describes a tabletop base or a standalone console before assuming it includes swivel." },
  { q: "Do swivel glass TV stands work without a dresser or table underneath?", a: "No. Tabletop swivel bases like the PERLESMITH PSTVS13 and PSTVS04 are designed to sit on top of an existing piece of furniture, they do not include legs or a floor-standing frame. If you don't already have a sturdy, wide enough surface, choose a standalone floor stand instead, such as the FITUEYES or TAVR picks, which include their own legs and sit directly on the floor." },
  { q: "Do glass TV stands show fingerprints and dust more than wood ones?", a: "Yes, and this is often not disclosed clearly by sellers. Tempered glass, particularly in black or smoked finishes, shows fingerprints, dust, and pet hair more visibly than wood or laminate surfaces. White or clear glass hides marks better than black glass, but any glass surface will need more frequent wiping than a matte wood stand in a high-traffic room." },
  { q: "How much weight can a glass TV stand hold?", a: "It depends on the style. Tabletop swivel bases in this guide range from 88 to 99 lbs. Standalone floor stands range from 88 to 110 lbs. Full media consoles with glass shelving reach up to 150 lbs. Always check your TV's actual shipping weight, not just its screen size, and account for any soundbar or game console sharing the same shelf." },
  { q: "Is tempered glass safe for a TV stand?", a: "Tempered glass is heat-treated to be significantly stronger than regular glass and is standard in this category specifically because it resists shattering under normal use and stays intact even if it does break. All 8 picks in this guide use tempered glass for their base or shelving. Avoid stands that don't specify tempered glass in the listing." },
  { q: "Can a glass TV stand hold a game console and a soundbar at the same time?", a: "Yes, but check both the shelf count and total weight capacity. Consoles with multiple adjustable glass shelves, like the WLIVE and Rfiver picks, give more separate surfaces for a game console, receiver, and soundbar. Tabletop swivel bases have less shelf space and rely on the furniture underneath for extra storage, so they are less suited to stacking multiple devices." },
