  "\"Desktop whiteboard organizer\" usually implies a standalone accessory, something you add to an existing whiteboard to organize markers, notes, or small supplies separately from the board itself. In this research pass, we could not find verified Amazon listings for standalone whiteboard organizer accessories sold independently of a complete whiteboard purchase.",
  "What we did find, and what we cover in detail elsewhere, is a set of complete desktop whiteboards that come with integrated storage already built in, drawers or trays attached directly to the whiteboard unit. If your goal is a place to keep markers and small supplies at your desk alongside a writing surface, those integrated-storage whiteboards are the practical match for what most people mean by \"whiteboard organizer,\" and we link to that guide below rather than mislabeling a complete whiteboard as a standalone organizer accessory.",
