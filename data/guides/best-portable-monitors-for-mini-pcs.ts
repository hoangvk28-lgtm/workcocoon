export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check the refresh rate ceiling for each port separately, not just the headline spec",
    "explanation": "A portable monitor's advertised refresh rate is typically its maximum achievable rate on its best-performing port, usually USB-C using DisplayPort Alt Mode, but the same panel connected over HDMI, especially older HDMI 2.0, frequently caps at a meaningfully lower rate because HDMI 2.0's bandwidth can't sustain the same data throughput as USB-C at higher resolutions.\n\nThis is a genuinely common source of buyer disappointment: someone buys a monitor rated 144Hz specifically to pair with a game console over HDMI, only to discover the HDMI port caps at 120Hz or even 60Hz on that specific model, a distinction the headline spec doesn't disclose.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for per-port refresh rate figures (USB-C rate versus HDMI rate stated separately), and match the port you'll actually use to the rate you actually need, not the single highest number in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your specific source device can actually output above 60Hz before paying extra for a high refresh panel",
    "explanation": "A monitor's refresh rate capability is meaningless if the connected source device can't output a signal above 60Hz in the first place, and this is a genuinely common mismatch: many laptop USB-C ports are data-only or video-limited to 60Hz regardless of Thunderbolt or USB4 branding, and handheld gaming PCs like Steam Deck and ROG Ally specifically output capped at 60Hz over USB-C in their current hardware generation, making a 144Hz-rated monitor's extra capability completely unused for that pairing despite the higher price paid for it.\n\nBefore buying specifically for the refresh rate, check your exact source device's documented maximum output refresh rate over the connection type you'll actually use (not just its general spec sheet), since a monitor's rated capability and your source device's actual output are two entirely separate specifications that both need to support the higher rate."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand that response time (GtG) affects visible motion clarity as much as refresh rate does",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate (how many times per second the image updates) and response time (how quickly individual pixels can change color, commonly measured in milliseconds as gray-to-gray or GtG) are two separate specs that both affect how smooth and clear fast motion looks, and a high refresh rate paired with a slow response time still produces visible ghosting or blur trailing behind fast-moving objects, since the panel can't physically change pixel colors fast enough to keep up with the higher refresh rate's demands.\n\nThis matters because response time is disclosed far less consistently than refresh rate across portable monitor listings, many simply omit it entirely, making direct comparison difficult even when two panels share the same headline refresh number.\n\nCheck specifically for a stated GtG response time in milliseconds, and treat a genuinely high refresh rate spec with some skepticism if the listing doesn't also disclose response time, since the refresh number alone doesn't guarantee smooth-looking motion."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check power delivery and cable requirements, since a portable monitor's convenience depends on how it's actually powered",
    "explanation": "Portable monitors typically draw power either through the same USB-C cable carrying the video signal (single-cable operation, the more convenient setup) or through a separate dedicated power input, and some models support pass-through charging that lets your laptop's own charger power both the laptop and the monitor simultaneously through one connection.\n\nThis matters concretely for actual portability: a monitor requiring two separate cables (one for video, one for power) is meaningfully less convenient to set up and pack away than genuine single-cable operation, undermining part of the appeal of a \"portable\" monitor in the first place.\n\nCheck specifically whether the monitor supports single-cable USB-C operation with your source device, and confirm pass-through charging wattage if you want your laptop's charger to power both devices without needing two outlets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weigh review volume against star rating, since this category includes both established models and many newer, similar-looking entrants",
    "explanation": "Portable monitors from well-established sellers with years of accumulated sales carry review counts in the thousands, giving genuine statistical confidence in panel quality and long-term reliability, while newer listings, sometimes from the same manufacturer under a different model number or from less established brands entirely, can carry only a handful of reviews despite looking similarly specified and priced.\n\nThis is a real practical concern for a portable monitor specifically because panel defects (dead pixels, backlight bleed, uneven brightness) are a documented failure mode across this category, and a thin review base provides much less confidence that a specific listing's panel quality is consistent across units.\n\nWhen comparing two similarly specified and priced portable monitors, check both the star rating and the review count together, and treat a very small review count as a reason for extra caution even if the rating itself looks strong."

  { q: "Will my Mini PC's HDMI port drive a 4K120 or 165Hz portable monitor at full spec?", a: "Only if your Mini PC has an HDMI 2.1 port. Most budget Mini PCs ship with HDMI 2.0, which caps 4K at 60Hz with no VRR support, well short of a 4K120 or 165Hz monitor's rated performance." },
  { q: "Can I use USB-C to connect a portable monitor to my Mini PC?", a: "Sometimes. Unlike laptops, many Mini PC USB-C ports are data/charging-only and don't carry DisplayPort Alt Mode video signal. Verify your specific Mini PC's USB-C port capability before relying on it." },
  { q: "Can I mount a portable monitor on the same arm as my Mini PC?", a: "Yes, if both have VESA mounting holes. Many Mini PCs include their own VESA bracket, and a VESA-compatible portable monitor like the cocopar 18.5\" or VisionOwl picks in this guide can piggyback-mount alongside it." },
  { q: "Does a portable monitor drain my Mini PC's battery?", a: "No, this concern doesn't apply. Mini PCs are always mains-powered, so there's no battery to drain, unlike the laptop-specific power-budget concerns covered in our MacBook Air guide." },
