  "A queen murphy bed is the largest size most home offices can realistically fit, and it comes with size requirements that a full or twin bed does not. A vertical queen cabinet typically needs about 93 inches of ceiling clearance, accounting for an 88 inch closed cabinet plus roughly 5 inches of anchor and swing clearance, and the room itself needs close to 108 inches (9 feet) of width for comfortable side access to the mattress once it is down.",
  "This guide focuses on queen-specific sizing: ceiling height, room width, and how mattress weight needs to match the mechanism's counterbalance calibration, since a queen mattress can weigh anywhere from 60 to 130 lbs depending on the type. Below are the 8 picks we evaluated based on product specs and buyer feedback, ranging from a $197.00 hardware kit to a $1,239.99 assembled desk-integrated cabinet.",

export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Verify the desk surface is real and usable, not just marketing alongside a plain murphy bed",
    "explanation": "Some products marketed alongside desk-focused search terms are actually plain murphy beds with no integrated desk surface at all, just a folding cabinet bed that happens to show up in these results, while others genuinely build a fold-down or fixed desk into the cabinet face.\n\nThis distinction matters directly if desk integration is the actual reason you're buying, discovering after purchase that a \"murphy bed with desk\" has no real desk surface is a common and entirely avoidable disappointment.\n\nCheck the listing photos and description specifically for a described, dimensioned desk surface, not just the presence of desk-related keywords in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the desk surface's weight limit for items left sitting when the bed folds down",
    "explanation": "A fold-down desk built into a murphy bed cabinet has a real weight limit on what can safely sit on it when the bed mechanism operates, and unlike a standalone desk, that weight isn't just about the desk holding items, it's about whether those items interfere with or get damaged by the folding motion itself.\n\nThis matters directly for anyone planning to leave a monitor, laptop, or other equipment on the desk regularly, some cabinet beds require clearing the desk completely before folding, while others accommodate lighter items left in place.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for the desk's stated weight capacity and whether it requires being cleared before folding, not just the bed's own mattress weight rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Plan outlet and monitor arm placement before installation, not after",
    "explanation": "A murphy bed with desk changes position between folded-up and folded-down states, meaning any outlet you'll use for a monitor, lamp, or charger needs to remain accessible in both positions, and a monitor arm clamped to the desk edge needs clearance to move with the mechanism without hitting the wall or cabinet frame.\n\nThis matters because retrofitting outlet access or monitor arm clearance after installation is far more difficult than planning it beforehand, especially if the unit is wall-mounted.\n\nCheck the listing for outlet cutout or pass-through details, and measure your intended monitor arm's clearance needs against the cabinet's fold range before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match room ceiling height and wall space to your specific model's clearance requirements",
    "explanation": "Murphy bed cabinets require specific minimum ceiling height and wall clearance to operate the folding mechanism safely, and these requirements vary between models and mattress sizes, a queen-size unit needs meaningfully more clearance than a twin, and horizontal-mounted units have different wall-width requirements than vertical ones.\n\nThis matters because a unit that doesn't fit your room's actual ceiling height or wall dimensions simply can't be installed safely regardless of how good the desk integration looks in photos.\n\nCheck the listing's specific minimum ceiling height and wall clearance requirements against your room's actual measured dimensions before ordering, not just the general size category."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider professional installation versus DIY assembly for a mechanism you'll operate daily",
    "explanation": "A murphy bed's folding mechanism sees repeated daily stress if used as a genuine daily-fold desk-bed combo, and installation quality directly affects long-term safety and smooth operation, a mechanism installed slightly out of alignment can bind, sag, or wear unevenly over time.\n\nThis matters more for a unit that folds daily as part of an active desk-bed routine, less for one that stays in one position most of the time.\n\nCheck whether the listing includes or recommends professional installation, and factor that cost and time into your total decision if you're not confident assembling a wall-mounted mechanical system yourself."

    q: "How much room width do I need for a queen murphy bed?",
    a: "For comfortable access to both sides of the bed once it is lowered, plan for close to 108 inches (9 feet) of room width. Narrower rooms still work but will typically only allow access from one side of the mattress.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does mattress weight matter for a queen murphy bed mechanism?",
    a: "Yes. Queen mattresses range from about 60 lbs for a basic foam mattress to 130 lbs for a thick hybrid, and murphy bed mechanisms are calibrated to a specific weight range. A mismatched mattress can make the fold feel too heavy or spring up too quickly, so check the manufacturer's recommended weight range before ordering.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I budget for shipping and installation on a queen murphy bed?",
    a: "Assembled queen cabinets often ship at 300-500 lbs across multiple boxes, and white glove delivery or professional installation commonly adds $400-800 on top of the product price. Factor this into your total budget rather than comparing sticker prices alone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the desk surface as wide as the cabinet on a confirmed desk pick?",
    a: "Not necessarily. Even on a confirmed desk pick like the Merax, the usable desk surface inside the cabinet face is typically narrower than the full cabinet width once hinges and side clearance are accounted for. Check the specific desk dimension in the current listing rather than assuming it matches the cabinet's overall width.",
