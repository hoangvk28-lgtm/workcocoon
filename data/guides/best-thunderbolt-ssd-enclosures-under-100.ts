export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Formal Intel Certification for Thunderbolt 3 Is a Distinct, Narrower Claim Than General Thunderbolt Compatibility",
    "explanation": "The SABRENT pick specifically states it is one of the only manufacturers fully certified by Intel for Thunderbolt 3 technology, a formal certification process distinct from a product simply claiming to be 'compatible' with Thunderbolt 3 without that certification, and this certification specifically applies to Thunderbolt 3, not the broader USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 compatibility that the other three picks in this comparison offer. This matters if formal Thunderbolt 3 certification specifically is a requirement for your use case, but also means checking that your computer has a genuine Thunderbolt 3 port rather than a standard USB-C port, since the SABRENT pick explicitly won't work with USB-C-only devices. Verify your exact port type (genuine Thunderbolt 3 versus standard USB-C or newer Thunderbolt 4/USB4) before choosing a Thunderbolt-3-only certified product over a broader-compatibility alternative."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Tiered Warranty Structure That Extends With a Complete Solution Purchase Rewards Buying the Full Package",
    "explanation": "The OWC pick's warranty structure specifically offers 2 years of coverage for the enclosure alone, extending to 3 years when purchased as a complete solution paired with an OWC-branded SSD, a structure that incentivizes buying both components from the same manufacturer rather than pairing the enclosure with a third-party SSD. This matters if you're deciding whether to buy an OWC SSD alongside this enclosure versus using an SSD you already own or purchasing a cheaper third-party drive, where the warranty difference is a genuine factor in that total cost and risk calculation. Consider whether the extended warranty tier is worth pairing with an OWC-branded SSD specifically, versus using your own preferred SSD with the shorter enclosure-only warranty coverage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "In-House Quality Lab Testing Claims Suggest Additional Manufacturer-Level Validation Beyond Industry-Standard Certification",
    "explanation": "The Lexar pick specifically states its products undergo extensive testing in Lexar Quality Labs, a manufacturer-specific quality assurance process distinct from and additional to any third-party certification like Intel's Thunderbolt certification, suggesting Lexar performs its own internal validation on top of whatever industry standards the product meets. This matters as one additional signal of manufacturer confidence and quality control rigor, though it's worth noting that in-house testing claims are self-reported and don't carry the same independent verification weight as a formal third-party certification like Intel's Thunderbolt program. Consider in-house quality testing claims as a positive signal alongside, not as a replacement for, independently verifiable certifications when comparing similarly priced options."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Detachable Cable Design Provides Practical Flexibility That a Fixed or Built-In Cable Doesn't Offer",
    "explanation": "The SABRENT pick's fully detachable cable design lets you swap in a cable of whatever length suits your specific setup, whether a short cable for a compact desk arrangement or a longer cable for reaching a computer positioned farther away, a flexibility that a fixed-cable enclosure design doesn't provide since you're stuck with whatever length ships in the box. This matters if your specific desk or workspace layout has unusual cable-length requirements, less so if a standard included cable length already works fine for your setup. Check whether a listing specifically describes a detachable or interchangeable cable design if cable length flexibility matters for your particular workspace arrangement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Specific Transfer Time Benchmark in Seconds Provides a More Intuitive Performance Expectation Than a Raw Speed Figure",
    "explanation": "The ICY BOX pick's specific claim of transferring 10GB in under 7 seconds translates a technical speed figure into a genuinely intuitive, real-world time expectation that's easier to relate to your actual use case than an abstract '40Gbps' or 'MB/s' number alone. This matters because most buyers think in terms of how long a specific task will take rather than raw throughput numbers, making a concrete time-based benchmark more directly useful for setting realistic expectations about your actual workflow, like how long a specific project backup or video file transfer will take. Look for time-based transfer benchmarks (like 'X GB in Y seconds') in addition to raw speed figures when comparing real-world performance expectations across similarly speed-rated enclosures."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Can the SABRENT Thunderbolt 3 enclosure work with a Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 port on a newer computer?", "a": "The listing specifically states the enclosure requires a genuine Thunderbolt 3 port and explicitly notes it is not compatible with USB-C ports, so while Thunderbolt 4 ports are generally backward compatible with Thunderbolt 3 devices, confirming your specific port's Thunderbolt 3 compatibility before purchase is worth doing to avoid connectivity issues." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing an OWC enclosure for its warranty benefits?", "a": "Assuming the extended 3-year warranty tier applies automatically regardless of what SSD you install, when the extended coverage specifically requires purchasing the enclosure as a complete solution paired with an OWC-branded SSD, so using a third-party SSD keeps you at the shorter 2-year enclosure-only warranty." },
  { "q": "Is the OWC pick worth it over the cheaper ICY BOX option?", "a": "If you specifically want a flexible tiered warranty structure with a complete accessory package including a screwdriver, yes, but if established brand engineering with the most flexible Thunderbolt and USB4 compatibility matters more, the ICY BOX pick covers that for about $9 less." },
  { "q": "How do I know if my computer's Thunderbolt port is genuine Thunderbolt 3 versus just a compatible USB-C port?", "a": "Check your computer manufacturer's official specifications for the exact port designation, since genuine Thunderbolt 3 ports are typically marked with a lightning bolt icon on the physical port itself, distinguishing them from standard USB-C ports that may look similar but lack Thunderbolt certification." },
  { "q": "Do these enclosures come with the M.2 NVMe SSD included, or is that purchased separately?", "a": "No, all four picks in this comparison are enclosures only, requiring a separately purchased compatible M.2 NVMe SSD to be installed before use, so budget for that additional cost when planning your total purchase." },
  { "q": "Can I use the Lexar E750's in-house quality lab testing claim as a substitute for checking independent reviews?", "a": "In-house testing claims provide some assurance of manufacturer quality control, but checking independent buyer feedback and reviews alongside manufacturer claims gives a more complete picture of real-world reliability, since self-reported testing claims aren't independently verified the way a third-party certification would be." }
