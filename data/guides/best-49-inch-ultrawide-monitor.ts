  {
    "criterion": "Verify build material and construction quality from reviews, not just spec-sheet claims",
    "explanation": "A product description can describe material or construction in flattering terms that don't always hold up under real, sustained use, and the gap between a listing's claimed quality and its actual durability only shows up in how the product performs after weeks or months of real use, not in day-one photos.\n\nThis matters more for anything you'll use daily or under real load, less for occasional light use where durability matters less.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for mentions of how the ultrawide monitor 49 inch holds up over time, not just unboxing-day impressions, and treat a listing's own quality claims as a starting point to verify, not a guarantee."

    "explanation": "A feature appearing in a product's bullet points doesn't guarantee it performs well in practice, some features are functional but limited, and a few are closer to a marketing checkbox than a genuinely useful capability.\n\nThis matters directly if a specific feature is the main reason you're choosing this ultrawide monitor 49 inch over a simpler, cheaper alternative, since a feature that underperforms in practice undermines the whole reason for paying more.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for real-world experiences with the exact feature that matters most to you, not just whether the feature is listed at all."

    "criterion": "Weigh review count alongside rating, not rating alone",

  {
    q: "How much desk depth do I actually need for a 49-inch monitor?",
    a: "Plan for at least 28-30 inches of usable desk depth, measured from the front edge of the desk to the wall, plus roughly 3 inches of clearance behind the monitor for cables. Measuring the published desktop size instead of your actual usable depth is the most common mistake buyers make with 49-inch monitors.",
  },
  {
    q: "How far back should I sit from a 49-inch ultrawide?",
    a: "Around 35-39 inches is the comfortable range for a 49-inch super-ultrawide, noticeably farther than the roughly 24 inches most people sit from a normal monitor. Sitting too close makes the curve feel distorted and increases how much you need to turn your head to read the edges.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a 49-inch monitor sharper than a 34-inch ultrawide?",
    a: "No, not meaningfully. A 5120x1440 49-inch panel and a 3440x1440 34-inch panel both land around 108-110 PPI, so text and image sharpness feel about the same. The real difference between the two sizes is desk space and screen real estate, not image clarity.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which 49-inch monitor in this guide is best for gaming versus office work?",
    a: "For gaming, the Samsung Odyssey G93SC and G95C both hit 240Hz with strong contrast. For office and multi-device work, the Dell UltraSharp U4924DW and Samsung Business S95UA both include a built-in KVM switch and prioritize color accuracy and connectivity over refresh rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I worry about the Samsung Odyssey G95SD's low rating?",
    a: "It's worth factoring in. At 3.8 stars, the G95SD is the lowest-rated pick in this entire guide despite having the most smart features, including a Glare-Free coating and a standalone Gaming Hub. If those specific features matter for your setup it may still be worth considering, but it's the one pick in this guide we'd recommend comparing carefully against its higher-rated alternatives first.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does mounting a curved 49-inch monitor on an arm require anything special?",
    a: "Yes. Curved panels shift the center of gravity forward compared to a flat monitor of the same weight, which can multiply the effective torque on an arm's tilt pivot by roughly 1.5-2x. Confirm any monitor arm you pair with these picks is rated for that added load, not just the panel's listed weight.",
