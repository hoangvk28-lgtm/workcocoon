export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A PoE HAT's Isolation Rating Determines Its Safety Margin With Non-Compliant or Passive PoE Sources",
    "explanation": "The LoveRPi pick specifically states 3KV galvanic isolation designed for switches and power sourcing equipment that don't provide their own PSE-side isolation, a notably higher protection margin than a standard isolated SMPS design without a specifically stated isolation voltage. This matters significantly if you're using a passive DC 48V injector or a non-IEEE-compliant PoE source that doesn't handle isolation on its own end, and matters less if you're using a fully compliant, high-quality 802.3af/at switch with its own proper isolation. Check a PoE HAT's specifically stated isolation voltage rating if your PoE source is passive or non-standard, rather than assuming any 'isolated' claim provides equivalent protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A HAT's Physical Size Directly Affects Whether It Fits Inside Your Specific Raspberry Pi Case",
    "explanation": "The UCTRONICS pick specifically states a 65mm by 44mm by 13mm footprint, nearly half the size of the official Raspberry Pi PoE HAT, a real space consideration if you're using a compact case that the larger official HAT or the similarly-sized waveshare pick wouldn't fit inside without modification. This matters if you've already selected a specific compact case for your Pi project, and matters less if you're using an open frame or a case specifically designed to accommodate the official HAT's larger dimensions. Measure your specific case's internal clearance against a HAT's stated dimensions before assuming any PoE HAT fits your particular enclosure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Additional Output Ports on a PoE HAT Can Power Accessories Beyond Just the Raspberry Pi Itself",
    "explanation": "The waveshare pick specifically includes both 5V USB-A and 12V header outputs beyond just powering the Pi, letting you connect and power an additional external device like a fan, sensor, or display from the same HAT without a separate power source. This matters if your project includes accessories that need their own power beyond what the Pi itself draws, and matters less if your setup only needs to power the bare Raspberry Pi board. Check whether a PoE HAT offers additional output ports if your specific project includes accessories requiring separate power delivery."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "The Raspberry Pi Zero Series Requires a Fundamentally Different HAT Than the Pi 4B or 3B+ Due to No Native Ethernet",
    "explanation": "The Waveshare PoE Ethernet USB HUB HAT is specifically designed for the Pi Zero, Zero W, and Zero 2 W boards, which have no native Ethernet port at all, meaning this HAT must add both Ethernet connectivity and PoE power simultaneously, a fundamentally different requirement than the Pi 4B/3B+ HATs that only need to add power since those boards already have built-in Ethernet. This matters significantly since a standard Pi 4B/3B+ PoE HAT physically won't work with the Zero series' different GPIO layout and lack of Ethernet hardware. Verify your specific Raspberry Pi model (Zero series versus 4B/3B+) before purchasing a PoE HAT, since these two HAT categories are not interchangeable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Active Cooling Fans on a PoE HAT Address Real Heat Generation That Passive Designs Require External Ventilation to Manage",
    "explanation": "The waveshare pick specifically includes an onboard active cooling fan for better heat dissipation, while the UCTRONICS pick explicitly recommends ensuring adequate air circulation since it becomes hot during normal operation without its own fan, a real difference in thermal management approach between the two HATs. This matters if you're installing the Pi in an enclosed case with limited airflow, where an onboard fan provides more reliable cooling, and matters less if your Pi sits in an open, well-ventilated location where passive cooling is adequate. Check whether a HAT includes active cooling or relies on your case providing adequate passive airflow before finalizing your case and cooling setup together."

  { "q": "Do I need a PoE HAT or a separate PoE splitter box for my Raspberry Pi?", "a": "A PoE HAT mounts directly onto the Pi's GPIO header without a separate box, the more common and integrated solution for Pi 4B/3B+ specifically, while a separate splitter with a USB-C or Micro USB cable is a more universal option that also works with non-Pi devices." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a PoE HAT for Raspberry Pi?", "a": "Assuming any PoE HAT fits any Raspberry Pi model, when the Pi Zero series requires a fundamentally different HAT design that adds both Ethernet and power, incompatible with the standard Pi 4B/3B+ HATs in this comparison." },
  { "q": "Is the LoveRPi HAT worth it for just a single Raspberry Pi, not a cluster?", "a": "The LoveRPi's cluster-oriented design and 3KV isolation work fine for a single Pi too, and its lower price makes it a reasonable choice even for non-cluster use, though the waveshare or UCTRONICS picks may better suit specific single-board needs like accessory power or compact size." },
  { "q": "Can I use these PoE HATs with a passive PoE injector instead of a standard switch?", "a": "The LoveRPi pick specifically states compatibility with passive DC 48V power sourcing equipment in addition to standard IEEE 802.3af/at switches, making it the most flexible choice in this comparison for passive PoE sources." },
  { "q": "Does a PoE HAT need active cooling to work reliably?", "a": "The waveshare pick includes an onboard fan for active cooling, while the UCTRONICS and LoveRPi picks specifically recommend ensuring adequate case ventilation since they can run hot without their own fan, so checking your case's airflow before installation is worth doing." },
  { "q": "Will a Raspberry Pi 4B PoE HAT work with my Raspberry Pi Zero?", "a": "No, the Pi Zero series has a different form factor and no native Ethernet port, requiring a specifically designed HAT like the Waveshare PoE Ethernet USB HUB HAT rather than a standard Pi 4B/3B+ PoE HAT." }
