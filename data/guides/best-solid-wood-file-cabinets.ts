    q: "What is the difference between a veneer finish and a laminate finish?",
    a: "Veneer is a thin layer of real wood applied over an engineered wood core. Laminate is a printed film over the core. Both can look realistic, but veneer typically has more natural variation and a more tactile feel. Laminate is more resistant to scratching in many cases.",

    q: "Can I use a lateral file cabinet as a printer stand?",

    a: "High-quality engineered wood furniture from established brands like Bush and Sauder is designed for 5 to 10 or more years of normal home office use. The main risk factors are moisture, overloading drawers, and damage to the laminate surface. Keep engineered wood furniture away from humidity and direct sunlight to maximize lifespan.",
