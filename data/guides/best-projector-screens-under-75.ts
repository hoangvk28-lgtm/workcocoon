export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Stated Gain Rating Is a Specific, Comparable Spec That 'High Quality' Marketing Language Isn't",
    "explanation": "Gain measures how much a screen reflects light back toward the viewer compared to a standard reference white surface, and the Fiberglass 80in pick's stated 1.2 gain rating gives you a specific, checkable number to compare against other screens, unlike the Wootfairy pick's more generic quality claims without a specific gain figure. This matters because a higher gain screen reflects more light back for a brighter image but often has a narrower optimal viewing angle, while a lower gain screen spreads light more evenly across a wider viewing angle but appears somewhat dimmer. Look for a specific numeric gain rating in a listing if you want to make an informed comparison, and consider your room's typical seating width when deciding whether higher gain (narrower angle, brighter) or standard gain (wider angle, standard brightness) suits your setup better."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fiberglass Construction Differs Structurally From Polyester Milk Silk, Affecting Rigidity and Reproduction Quality",
    "explanation": "The Fiberglass 80in pick's fiberglass material with a black coated back is a structurally different material from the polyester milk silk used in the Wootfairy pick, generally offering more rigidity and a more consistent reflective surface that supports the stated 4K Ultra HD reproduction claim. This matters if very high-resolution content quality is a priority, where a more rigid, specialized material can maintain surface consistency better than a softer fabric that might develop subtle waviness over repeated folding. Consider whether your projector and content resolution genuinely benefit from a more specialized screen material, or whether a standard polyester screen's larger size better serves your actual viewing needs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Black Masking Border Improves Perceived Image Sharpness Through a Genuine Optical Effect, Not Just Aesthetics",
    "explanation": "The Pyle 40-Inch pick's black masking border around the projection area creates a visual contrast effect that makes the projected image appear sharper and better defined, a real optical phenomenon related to how the human eye perceives contrast at edges, not merely a decorative border. This matters more for presentation or classroom use where image clarity and audience focus matter, and less for casual movie-night viewing where the effect is a nice-to-have rather than essential. Check whether a listing specifically mentions a masking border if precise image definition matters for your specific use case, like detailed text or graphics in presentations."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Aspect Ratio Should Match Your Primary Content Type, Not Just the Largest Available Screen Size",
    "explanation": "The Pyle 40-Inch pick's 4:3 aspect ratio suits older presentation formats and certain classroom or office content, while the 16:9 aspect ratio used by the other three picks in this comparison matches modern widescreen movies, streaming content, and most current video formats. This matters because projecting 16:9 content onto a 4:3 screen (or vice versa) results in either black bars or cropped content, regardless of how large or high-quality the screen otherwise is. Confirm your primary content's aspect ratio, checking your projector's typical output format, before choosing a screen aspect ratio, rather than assuming a larger screen automatically suits your content better."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Screen Weight Affects Genuine Portability for Repeated Setup and Teardown, Not Just One-Time Transport",
    "explanation": "The Aluminium Frame 60in pick's 8.6 lb weight and the Wootfairy pick's 8.3 lb weight are both notably light for stand-equipped screens, making a real difference if you plan frequent setup and teardown for events, camping, or regularly rotating between rooms, versus a heavier screen you'd rather leave semi-permanently assembled. This matters less if the screen will live in one fixed location indefinitely, where weight becomes largely irrelevant after the initial setup. Consider your actual frequency of moving or repositioning the screen before treating a lighter weight as a meaningfully important factor over other specs like size or gain rating."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Does a higher gain rating always mean a better picture regardless of room setup?", "a": "No, a higher gain screen reflects more light back but typically has a narrower optimal viewing angle, so it's better for a room with seating positioned relatively centrally, while a wider seating arrangement benefits more from a standard or lower gain rating for even brightness across the room." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when comparing screen sizes across different aspect ratios in this tier?", "a": "Comparing the diagonal size numbers directly between a 4:3 screen like the Pyle pick and a 16:9 screen like the others, when the actual viewing area shape differs significantly, so the same diagonal measurement doesn't represent the same width or height between the two ratios." },
  { "q": "Is the Fiberglass 80in pick worth it over the cheaper Wootfairy 100in option?", "a": "If you specifically want a stated 1.2 gain rating with fiberglass construction for 4K reproduction, yes, but if maximum viewing area at the same price matters more, the Wootfairy pick delivers 100 inches for the same $69.99." },
  { "q": "How do I know if the Aluminium Frame pick's 60 inch size is large enough for my room?", "a": "Measure your intended viewing distance and compare it against general projector screen sizing guidelines, since a 60 inch screen suits closer viewing distances typical of smaller rooms, while larger rooms with more distance between viewer and screen benefit from the bigger sizes in this tier." },
  { "q": "Can the Pyle 40-Inch screen's 4:3 ratio still display widescreen movies, just with black bars?", "a": "Yes, widescreen 16:9 content will display with black bars on a 4:3 screen, which works fine functionally but doesn't maximize the screen's usable area for that specific content type, so a 16:9 pick is the better match if movies are your primary use." },
  { "q": "Do any of these screens require specific projector brightness levels to look good?", "a": "Higher gain screens like the Fiberglass 80in pick can work well with lower-lumen projectors since they reflect more light, while standard gain screens generally benefit from a brighter projector, so checking your specific projector's stated lumen output against the screen's gain rating helps ensure a good match." }
