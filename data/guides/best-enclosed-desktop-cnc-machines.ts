Auto probing and surface leveling calibrate the workpiece before each cut, which matters more than raw spindle speed on uneven stock.\n\nSpindle runout under 0.0004 in and motor resolution of 0.0002 in are real, documented figures rather than a vague accuracy claim. Makera's own CAM software runs on Mac and Windows, and the controller also works across iOS, Android, and Linux, with Fusion 360 and VCarve Pro support for anyone who outgrows the bundled app.",

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does an enclosure on enclosed desktop cnc machines actually reduce noise, or just look contained?",
    "a": "A genuine factory-integrated enclosure with proper seals does measurably reduce noise and contain chips, but a thin acrylic shell without extraction mainly traps dust rather than solving noise or air quality."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I still access the workholding easily on an enclosed machine?",
    "a": "This varies by design. Check that the enclosure allows reasonable door or panel access for setup and maintenance, since some enclosed designs trade convenience for containment."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is GRBL control harder to use than a proprietary CNC app?",
    "a": "GRBL has a steeper initial learning curve since it relies on separate CAM software and a G-code sender, but it's open-source with extensive community support and works across many machines. Proprietary apps trade some of that flexibility for a more guided, beginner-friendly workflow."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a machine's motor resolution figure tell me its real cutting accuracy?",
    "a": "Not directly. Motor or controller resolution describes the smallest theoretical step size, while real part accuracy also depends on frame rigidity, backlash, and tool deflection under load. A repeatable test cut is a better accuracy indicator than a resolution spec alone."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a desktop CNC router genuinely cut metal, or just engrave it?",
    "a": "This depends heavily on spindle torque, rigidity, and tooling. Many desktop routers can engrave or lightly cut soft metals like aluminum and brass with the right bits and shallow passes, but cutting steel or deep aluminum passes generally needs a genuinely rigid, higher-torque machine."
