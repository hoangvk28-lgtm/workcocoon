export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decide whether ticking noise matters to you",
    "explanation": "A standard quartz movement advances its second hand once per second and produces an audible tick you can hear from a few feet away, while a silent sweep or silent electronic movement moves continuously with no tick at all.\n\nThis matters more than it sounds like it should: a clock that ticks audibly for eight hours a day within arm's reach of where you work becomes a genuine background irritant for a lot of people, even if they don't consciously register it as a complaint until the clock is removed or replaced.\n\nTo check this before buying, search the listing for the words \"silent,\" \"non-ticking,\" or \"sweep movement\" specifically, since a listing that doesn't mention noise at all is very likely a standard audible-tick quartz movement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match the face or display size to real viewing distance",
    "explanation": "The size printed in a listing, usually in inches, measures the clock's case or face diameter, but that number alone doesn't tell you how easily you'll actually be able to read the time from where you sit.\n\nA 3 to 4 inch face reads fine from arm's length at a desk but becomes genuinely hard to read from across a room or a doorway, which matters if the clock's real job is to be glanced at from a distance rather than up close.\n\nCheck the listing's stated dimensions against your actual distance from where the clock will sit, and for digital models, look specifically for the digit height in inches rather than the overall unit size, since a large plastic housing can still contain small digits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the power source before you plan where it goes",
    "explanation": "Desk clocks are either battery powered, meaning they can sit anywhere with no cord in the way, or corded and plugged into a wall outlet, sometimes with a battery backup that keeps the display running briefly during an outage.\n\nThis is a genuinely practical constraint, not a minor spec: a corded clock needs to sit within cord-length of an outlet, which can rule out the center of a desk or a shelf far from a plug, while a battery clock can go anywhere but will eventually need a battery swap.\n\nLook for \"battery operated\" versus \"plug-in\" or \"AC powered\" directly in the listing title or bullet points, and treat advertised USB charging ports as a strong signal the unit is corded rather than battery-only."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Separate gift-tier materials from everyday functional clocks",
    "explanation": "Clocks made from marble or crystal, or featuring custom engraving, are priced and designed first as a gift or a statement object, with everyday timekeeping treated as secondary, while clocks built from plastic or basic wood with digital or simple analog displays are priced for everyday practical use.\n\nBuying a hand-carved marble clock expecting the same day-to-day practicality as a basic digital clock with a dimmer and USB ports will lead to disappointment, since these are genuinely different product categories that happen to share a name.\n\nCheck whether the listing emphasizes material and craftsmanship language (hand carved, polished, engraved) versus functional language (auto DST, dual alarms, temperature display) to quickly tell which tier a given clock falls into."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check for lead time if the piece is personalized or engraved",
    "explanation": "Custom engraving or personalization isn't applied instantly at a warehouse the way a standard product ships; it typically requires a separate production step after you submit your design or text, which the seller has to complete before the item even enters the shipping queue.\n\nThis means a personalized clock ordered as a last-minute gift can easily miss a deadline that a standard, non-personalized clock would have made with days to spare, since the engraving step alone commonly adds several business days on top of normal shipping time.\n\nBefore ordering a personalized piece for a specific date, check the listing's stated production or processing time, which is separate from shipping time, and order with enough buffer for both steps to finish before you need it."
