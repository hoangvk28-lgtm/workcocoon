export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    "criterion": "Measure your actual under-desk clearance before comparing treadmill height",
    "explanation": "An under-desk treadmill needs to physically slide into the same clearance a chair would otherwise occupy, and this clearance varies by desk, both the standing desk's lowest sit height and any crossbar or cable tray underneath can limit how tall a treadmill fits.\n\nThis matters because a treadmill that looks compact in photos can still be too tall for your specific desk's clearance, a mismatch that's only discovered after the treadmill arrives.\n\nMeasure the actual clear height under your desk at its lowest working position, and compare that against the treadmill's listed height, leaving real margin rather than an exact match."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match motor power and speed range to walking, not running, since that's what these are built for",
    "explanation": "Most under-desk treadmills are built for a slow 1-4 mph walking pace during work, not a running pace, and their motors are sized accordingly, a lighter-duty motor rated for walking speeds will struggle or wear out faster if pushed toward running speeds it wasn't designed for.\n\nThis matters directly if you're specifically hoping to run rather than walk while working, a genuine running-capable treadmill needs a meaningfully more powerful motor and a different category of product than most under-desk walking pads.\n\nCheck the listed max speed and motor horsepower rating against your actual intended pace, and don't assume any \"treadmill\" labeled product supports running speeds."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check noise level specifically for video calls and shared office spaces",
    "explanation": "A treadmill's motor and belt generate continuous noise while walking, and that noise level matters far more for this category than a typical treadmill, since you'll likely be on video calls or in a shared workspace while using it, a treadmill quiet enough for a private home gym can still be distracting on a work call in an open office.\n\nThis matters more the more of your work involves calls or a shared space, less if you work in a private office with the door closed.\n\nCheck reviews specifically for noise mentions during video calls or in shared spaces, not just a general decibel rating that may be measured under different conditions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Verify safety features like an auto-stop cord and remote start/stop for working while walking",
    "explanation": "An auto-stop safety cord (clipped to your clothing, stopping the belt if you step off unexpectedly) and a remote or app-based start/stop control matter more for this category than a typical gym treadmill, since you'll be dividing attention between the treadmill and actual work rather than fully focused on walking.\n\nThis matters because a moment of distraction while multitasking is exactly when an unexpected stumble is most likely, and having quick, reliable stop control reduces that risk.\n\nCheck the listing specifically for a safety cord and remote control features, not just speed and incline specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Consider incline if you want a genuine calorie-burn increase, not just flat walking",
    "explanation": "An incline feature meaningfully increases calorie burn and leg engagement compared to flat walking at the same speed, but it's a feature most under-desk treadmills skip entirely to keep the profile slim and the price down, and even among models that offer it, incline range varies from a token few degrees to a genuinely adjustable range.\n\nThis matters more if fitness intensity is a real goal beyond just light movement during work, less if you're primarily looking for gentle activity while working.\n\nCheck whether incline is offered at all and, if so, the specific adjustable range in degrees, not just the word \"incline\" in the listing."
