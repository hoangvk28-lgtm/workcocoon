export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A Dedicated Cellular Travel Router Outperforms Phone Tethering in Ways That Matter for Extended Travel",
    "explanation": "A dedicated hotspot device, as the NETGEAR listing specifically notes, keeps your phone free from being tied up as a tethering source while also typically offering better battery management, more simultaneous device support, and often a stronger cellular modem than a phone's built-in tethering capability. This matters significantly for extended trips where you need your phone available for calls and its own tasks while still providing internet to multiple other devices, and matters less for brief occasional tethering needs where using your existing phone is simpler. Consider a dedicated cellular router specifically when your travel involves regular multi-device connectivity needs over an extended period."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "5G Coverage Remains Regionally Inconsistent, So Confirm Actual Coverage at Your Destinations Before Paying a 5G Premium",
    "explanation": "5G network infrastructure is considerably less widespread than 4G LTE, particularly outside major urban centers, meaning a 5G-capable router may frequently operate at 4G speeds in many of the locations you actually travel to, especially rural areas or many international destinations. This matters significantly if your typical travel involves rural areas or countries with less developed 5G infrastructure, where the extra cost for 5G capability may not translate to a real speed benefit, and matters less if you primarily travel to major cities with established 5G networks. Check actual 5G coverage maps for your specific planned destinations before paying a substantial premium for 5G capability."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In eSIM Technology Removes a Real Friction Point of Hunting for Local SIM Cards While Traveling Internationally",
    "explanation": "A router with built-in eSIM technology and app-based data plan purchasing, like the Nighthawk M7, lets you activate cellular data for a new country directly through an app before or upon arrival, avoiding the need to find a local phone shop, communicate in a foreign language, and physically swap a SIM card at each new destination. This matters significantly for frequent international travelers visiting multiple countries on one trip, and matters less for domestic travel or extended stays in one country where a single SIM card purchase covers the whole trip. Consider built-in eSIM capability specifically if your travel pattern involves visiting multiple countries where sourcing local SIM cards repeatedly would be a genuine hassle."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum Device Count Matters Significantly More for Group Travel Than for Solo or Couple Travel",
    "explanation": "A hotspot supporting 32 simultaneous devices provides real value for a family, tour group, or business team sharing one cellular connection across many laptops, tablets, and phones at once, while a lower device-count hotspot supporting 16 devices is still more than sufficient for a solo traveler or couple's actual connected device count. This matters significantly for group travel scenarios pooling one cellular connection across many devices, and matters much less for individual or couple travel with a modest number of devices. Match a hotspot's stated maximum device count to your actual expected simultaneous connections rather than assuming the highest number always justifies its price premium."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Built-In VPN Client Support on a Cellular Router Extends the Same Security Benefits Standard Travel Routers Offer to Cellular Connections",
    "explanation": "Most standard travel routers with VPN support are designed to secure hotel or public Wi-Fi connections, but a cellular hotspot with built-in VPN client support, like the GL.iNet MUDI, extends that same encrypted protection to your cellular data connection as well, useful for business travelers handling sensitive data over cellular networks in unfamiliar countries. This matters more for buyers who specifically want VPN protection applied to cellular traffic rather than running VPN software separately on each connected device, and matters less if you're comfortable managing VPN protection at the individual device level instead. Consider a cellular router with built-in VPN support specifically if centralizing VPN protection at the router level matters to your security requirements."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "What's the difference between a 5G travel router and a standard travel router?", "a": "A 5G or 4G travel router has its own built-in cellular modem and SIM slot, letting it connect to the internet independently through a cellular network, while a standard travel router requires an existing Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection to work from." },
  { "q": "Do I need a data plan for a 5G or 4G travel router to work?", "a": "Yes, every router in this comparison requires either a SIM card with an active data plan or, for eSIM-capable models, a data plan purchased through the manufacturer's app." },
  { "q": "Is 5G worth paying extra for compared to 4G LTE?", "a": "Only if you'll actually be in areas with strong 5G coverage; check coverage maps for your specific travel destinations, since 5G infrastructure remains considerably less widespread than 4G LTE, especially in rural or international areas." },
  { "q": "Can I use my existing phone's SIM card in a cellular travel router?", "a": "Some models accept a standard SIM card you can move from a compatible unlocked device, but check your specific carrier's terms and the router's SIM compatibility, since data-only plans typically differ from standard phone plans." },
  { "q": "How many devices can a cellular travel router realistically support at once?", "a": "The routers in this comparison range from 16 to 32 supported devices, though actual usable performance depends on how much bandwidth each connected device demands simultaneously." },
  { "q": "Is a built-in eSIM better than a physical SIM card for travel?", "a": "eSIM removes the need to physically source and swap SIM cards at each destination, which is more convenient for frequent international travel, though a physical SIM gives you more flexibility to shop around for the cheapest local carrier plan independently." }
