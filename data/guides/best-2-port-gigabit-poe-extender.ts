export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "PoE++ Support Doubles the Maximum Wattage Available Compared to Standard PoE+ on the Same Gigabit Extender",
    "explanation": "The TRENDnet pick specifically extends PoE++ power up to 60W per device, double the 30W ceiling of standard PoE+ found on the LINOVISION and Revotech picks, a real distinction that determines whether a higher-power device like a heated outdoor PTZ camera or advanced access point can be adequately powered at all. This matters significantly if any of your devices specifically require PoE++ power, since connecting a 60W-rated device to a PoE+-only extender simply won't deliver enough power for it to function correctly. Check your specific device's power requirement (PoE, PoE+, or PoE++) against an extender's maximum supported standard before assuming any 'Gigabit PoE extender' label covers your device's actual wattage need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Full Gigabit Speed and High-Wattage PoE++ Support Are Independent Features That Don't Automatically Come Together",
    "explanation": "All four picks in this comparison specifically maintain full 1000Mbps Gigabit speed, but only two of them, the TRENDnet and MokerLink picks, also support PoE++ high-wattage devices, showing that Gigabit speed alone doesn't guarantee high-wattage compatibility on every extender. This matters if you need both fast data transmission and high power delivery for the same device, and matters less if your bandwidth and power needs are both modest. Verify both a Gigabit extender's speed rating and its maximum supported PoE standard separately, rather than assuming a Gigabit-rated device automatically supports the highest available PoE wattage tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproof Cable Caps on an Outdoor Extender Require Correct Installation to Actually Achieve Their Rated Protection",
    "explanation": "The MokerLink pick's listing specifically instructs passing the network cable through the waterproof cap before making the RJ45 connection, a precise installation step that determines whether the extender's IP67 rating actually holds in practice, since an incorrectly assembled cable seal could compromise the water resistance despite the unit's rated specification. This matters significantly for a genuinely outdoor or wet-location installation where water intrusion could damage the extender or connected equipment, and matters less for an indoor installation where the waterproofing feature provides no practical benefit either way. Follow an outdoor extender's specific cable installation instructions carefully rather than assuming its IP rating holds regardless of how the cable connection is physically assembled."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Automatic Fault-Reset Feature Reduces the Need for a Manual Power Cycle When a Connected Device Freezes",
    "explanation": "The MokerLink pick's specifically named PoE Dog feature automatically resets a fault device without requiring you to manually unplug and reconnect the power, a genuinely convenient capability for a device installed somewhere less convenient to physically access, like an outdoor pole mount or a ceiling-mounted enclosure. This matters if your extender will power a device in a hard-to-reach location where manual troubleshooting is inconvenient, and matters less for an easily accessible desktop installation where manually power-cycling a frozen device takes only a moment. Check whether an extender specifically names an automatic fault-detection and reset feature if the devices it powers are installed somewhere genuinely inconvenient to manually reset."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cascade Distance Figures for Multi-Unit Configurations Can Vary Substantially Even Among Similarly Priced Extenders",
    "explanation": "The Revotech pick specifically documents a 6-unit cascade reaching 700 meters (2296ft), meaningfully longer than the TRENDnet pick's 4-unit cascade reaching 1640ft, even though the Revotech pick is priced significantly lower, showing that cascade distance and price don't always correlate directly. This matters if reaching the greatest possible total distance through multiple chained units is your priority, and matters less if a single extender's base range already covers your specific installation need. Compare each extender's specific maximum cascade configuration and total distance rather than assuming a higher-priced extender automatically offers a longer cascade range."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need PoE++ support for a standard security camera, or is PoE+ enough?", "a": "Most standard IP cameras work fine with PoE+ at up to 30W, and PoE++ is specifically needed only for higher-power devices like heated outdoor PTZ cameras or advanced access points, so checking your exact device's power requirement before paying extra for PoE++ support is worth doing." },
  { "q": "What's the most common mistake buyers make when choosing a 2-port Gigabit PoE extender?", "a": "Assuming any Gigabit-rated extender automatically supports the highest PoE wattage tier, when Gigabit speed and PoE++ high-wattage support are independent features that don't always come together on the same device." },
  { "q": "Is the TRENDnet extender worth the higher price over the Revotech pick?", "a": "If you specifically need to power PoE++ devices up to 60W and want the longest warranty, the TRENDnet's higher price is justified, but for standard PoE+ devices, the Revotech pick's much lower price and longer cascade support deliver strong value instead." },
  { "q": "How do I properly install the MokerLink outdoor extender to maintain its IP67 rating?", "a": "The listing specifically instructs passing the network cable through the waterproof cap before making the RJ45 connection, so following that exact installation sequence is necessary to actually achieve the unit's rated waterproof protection." },
  { "q": "Can I cascade multiple 2-port Gigabit extenders together to reach a greater distance?", "a": "Yes, several picks in this comparison support cascading, with the Revotech pick specifically documenting up to 6 units for 700 meters total, though following each product's specific cascade wiring instructions is necessary to achieve the documented maximum distance." },
  { "q": "Does NDAA and TAA compliance matter for a home or small business installation?", "a": "No, NDAA and TAA compliance are specifically federal procurement requirements relevant to government and some institutional buyers, with no practical relevance for a typical home or small business network installation." }
