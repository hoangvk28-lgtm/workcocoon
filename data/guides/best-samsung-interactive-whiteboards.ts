  "We built a current-series map separating WAF from WAD and verified exact touch specifications, OS generation, and management features by model rather than treating all Samsung interactive displays as interchangeable."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Separate flat panels, projectors, and portable systems",
    "explanation": "An interactive whiteboard can mean an all-in-one 4K flat panel, a projector paired with a sensor, or a portable conversion bar that turns any surface interactive. These solve different problems at very different price points, know which category you actually need before comparing specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Touch-point count is not simultaneous writing capacity",
    "explanation": "A board advertising 20-point touch does not mean 20 people can write clean, independent lines at once, some of those points cover palm rejection and gesture recognition. Check the manufacturer's stated simultaneous-writer number specifically, not just the raw touch-point spec."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "EDLA certification means something specific",
    "explanation": "Google EDLA (Enterprise Device Licensing Agreement) certification guarantees stable Google Play Store, Workspace, and Google Education Suite access with regular OTA security updates. A board merely running Android without EDLA certification may lose app-store access or updates over time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "OPS slots need a separately purchased module",
    "explanation": "Many boards advertise an OPS (Open Pluggable Specification) expansion slot for adding Windows compatibility, but the actual Windows OPS computer module is almost always sold separately and can cost as much as a mid-range laptop. Budget for it if Windows software is a real requirement."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wireless casting and wireless touch-back are different features",
    "explanation": "Casting lets a phone or laptop screen display on the board. Touch-back control lets you operate that connected device's cursor directly from the board's touchscreen. Confirm which one a specific product actually supports before assuming both are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mounting weight and wall structure matter as much as specs",
    "explanation": "A 75-inch or larger panel commonly weighs 80-150+ pounds. Confirm VESA mount compatibility and that your wall studs or mounting surface can support that load safely, professional installation is often worth the cost at this size."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What's the difference between Samsung's WAF and WAD series?",
    "a": "WAD is the more advanced line, adding a dual pen function for switching writing colors without changing settings, up to 40 simultaneous touchpoints versus WAF's standard multi-touch, a 3-in-1 USB-C port with 65W charging, and a centralized device management solution, all at a higher price than WAF."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does Samsung's OPS slot come with a Windows computer included?",
    "a": "No, the OPS slot is an expansion bay only. You need to separately purchase a compatible OPS Windows module to convert the display into a Windows device, it does not ship pre-installed."
  },
  {
    "q": "What does Google EDLA certification actually guarantee?",
    "a": "EDLA (Enterprise Device Licensing Agreement) certification means Google has verified the device for stable, ongoing access to the Google Play Store, Google Workspace, and Google Education Suite, plus regular over-the-air security updates. A board that just runs Android without EDLA certification can lose app-store access or stop receiving updates over time."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much does a large interactive whiteboard weigh, and does that matter for installation?",
    "a": "A 75-inch or larger panel commonly weighs 80 to 150+ pounds depending on the model. Confirm your wall has proper stud backing or use a VESA-compatible mobile stand rated for that weight, and consider professional installation at this size rather than a DIY wall mount."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is wireless screen casting the same as wireless touch control?",
    "a": "No, these are two separate features. Casting displays a connected phone, tablet, or laptop's screen on the board. Touch-back control additionally lets you operate that connected device's cursor and interface directly from the board's own touchscreen. Some boards support only casting, not touch-back, so check both separately."
