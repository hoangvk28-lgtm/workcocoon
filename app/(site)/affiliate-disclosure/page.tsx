          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            When you click a product link on WorkCocoon and complete a purchase on Amazon, Amazon pays us a small referral fee - typically 1–8% of the sale price depending on the product category. This fee is paid by Amazon, not added to your purchase price. You pay exactly the same amount whether you use our link or navigate to Amazon directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our links include an affiliate tag (<code className="font-mono text-xs bg-bg px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border border-border text-ink">workcocoon-20</code>) that allows Amazon to attribute the referral to our account. This tag is the only information passed; we do not receive your name, address, or payment details.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">Does This Affect Our Recommendations?</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            No. Our product rankings and recommendations are determined entirely by our editorial evaluation process, which you can read in full on our{" "}
            <Link prefetch={false} href="/how-we-review" className="text-brand hover:text-brand-dark font-medium underline underline-offset-2 transition-colors">
              How We Review page
            </Link>.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            We do not accept payment from brands or manufacturers for higher placement, better scores, or favorable reviews. Commission rates are set by Amazon and are uniform across comparable product categories - meaning we earn the same percentage whether we recommend a $15 cable kit or a $110 desk lamp. There is no financial incentive to recommend one product over another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Editorial recommendations should remain - and do remain - independent. If a product is not the best choice for our readers, we do not recommend it regardless of its commission rate.
