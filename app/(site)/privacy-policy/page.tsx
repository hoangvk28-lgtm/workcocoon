          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-ink mb-2">Analytics data</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We use anonymized analytics to understand which content is most useful to our readers. This may include page views, approximate geographic region (country level only), device type, browser type, and referring URLs. We do not collect names, email addresses, or any personally identifiable information through analytics. We do not build individual visitor profiles.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-ink mb-2">Contact form submissions</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you contact us through our contact form, we collect your name and email address solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not add contact form submissions to any mailing list without your explicit consent, and we do not share them with third parties.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-ink mb-2">Affiliate link clicks</h3>
          <p>
            When you click an affiliate link to Amazon.com, you leave our site and are subject to{" "}

              Amazon&apos;s privacy policy

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">3. Affiliate Links</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            As an Amazon Associate, we earn a small commission on qualifying purchases made through our links at no additional cost to you.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">4. Cookies</h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            WorkCocoon uses the minimum cookies necessary for the site to function (session management) and analytics cookies to understand visitor behavior in aggregate. We do not use advertising cookies, retargeting cookies, or cookies that track you across other websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can control or disable cookies in your browser settings. Disabling analytics cookies will not affect your ability to use any part of this site.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">5. Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            We may use a third-party analytics service (such as Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled, or a privacy-focused alternative like Plausible Analytics) to understand aggregate traffic patterns. These services process data according to their own privacy policies. We configure analytics to minimize data collection and do not enable advertising or remarketing features.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">6. Third-Party Links</h2>
          <p>
            Our site contains links to Amazon.com and other external sites. Once you leave WorkCocoon, you are subject to the privacy policies of those sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party websites. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any site you visit.
